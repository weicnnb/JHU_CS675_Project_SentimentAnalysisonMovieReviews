# notebook name

There are six ipynb notebook in this section:



4 notebooks on modelling with different vectorization 

Each ipynb notebook can be runed independently from the beginning, as they include the complete sections from loading data, pre-processing, split dataset, vectorization, modeling, performance measure...

> tfidf.ipynb: all models with tfidf vectorization

> BagOfWord_Ngram: all models with baseline (bag of word) and ngram vectorization

> word2vec1

> word2vec2

Fifth: We also uploaded a python notebook using which we webclawed extra testing set.

Sixth: Final Project Writeup which only includes main results and analysis
