Manjhi: The Mountain Man,"With due respect to Nawaz's acting and the man 'Dashrath Manjhi' who did such an insurmountable task, I would like to say that this shouldn't be classified as a movie, neither should it be classified as a documentary. It is not even a one-time watch.In the worst case scenario, it is a one-time watch, but only till intermission. People making such movies should consider on tweaking the storyline so that the movie emerges out as a good experience for viewer. I don't know what people found interesting in this movie but I will try to summarize my experience in following points :1. Entertainment - 4/10 This is only because of the first half of the movie, which is decent in terms of providing entertainment value to the viewers. The second half will almost literally compel you to sleep in theatre. 2. Determination - 5/10 People are confusing psychotic fad shown in the movie with words like 'determination' and 'willpower'. 3. Romance - 7/10This is not even a complete story. It is just a 2 hour long fact that a man carved out a path out of mountain in memory (psychotic fad) of his wife who passed away in an accident on mountain.4. Action - 2/10 Almost nil. There is a lot of time devoted in the movie to show misdeeds by highbrow goons. Even till the end, the dots for their punishment doesn't get connected despite of the fact that they are involved till end in the plot with Nawaz's character. All we get is just an 'out of nowhere' loose scene.5. Adventure - 2/10 Except for the maniac mountain crushing there is nothing at all. 15 minutes of futile scenes showcase Nawaz's travel from Bihar to Delhi by foot just to make the premise of a useless 2 minute scene in Delhi. It may have happened in real as it is based on a real story but from a movie perspective it was absolute rubbish in order to portray determination of the character.",negative
Manjhi: The Mountain Man,"Expect no grandeur and very un-Bollywood-like. The plot of the movie unfolds quite slowly like a classic movie should be, building up gradually in the first half and then you are so engrossed into the movie, that you hardly realize how quickly the second half passed by. Nawazuddin Siddiqui could have been the only actor at of today who could do justice to this role. Ketan Mehta has made sure that the real touch in this movie sticks as close to the actual incidences and he has succeeded thoroughly. Many filmmakers attempt to use or portray the themes from this part of India (like Amir Khan's PK or Salman Khan's Dabang). One can easily find that genuineness of Bihari culture is so hollow that it brings down the impact of the movie, rather than uplift it. The way all the actors have delivered their dialogues or put on their costumes is phenomenal. Siddiqui's performance is a stand-out and without doubt, it'll a benchmark in Bollywood, IMHO. Craziness of Manjhi is a legacy for Indians and Siddiquit has succeeded in bringing that out on the silver screen.",positive
Go Goa Gone,"Go Goa Gone is truly one of the most hilarious Hindi films since Delhi Belly. It's a zombie comedy, with lots of blood and gore, so it's in no way for the squeamish, and the humor is quite mature, so it's NOT a child-friendly watch, but, hey, it's the subject matter itself which isn't really kid-suitable.Nevertheless, Go Goa Gone sets out to bring a new genre into Indian cinema with great gusto, and it fails to fail. With rib-tickling lines, great comic acting by Kunal Khemu, Vir Das, Anand Tiwari, and even Saif Ali Khan as the quirky, macho Boris (soon to be one of the greatest cult characters of all of Hindi cinema), Go Goa Gone FORCES you to laugh effortlessly.Yes, the plot gets a little dragging at the second half, and Puja Gupta's acting isn't very novel (although she looks great), but mostly, Go Goa Gone just always makes you laugh at one point or the other. I was chuckling at every other moment. The zombies are well-made, for a first in Bollywood, and nothing looks cheap. The action is pretty nice, and the songs are quirky and trippy.I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to have a good laugh-fest. Except the kids, of course...",negative
Go Goa Gone,"It's a rarity for Indian movies to step beyond the conventional(and convenient) love stories and venture into the unknown.'Go Goa Gone' tries that and does a commendable job.You have heard of romcoms,now there is a new genre and it's called 'ZomCom!'.The movie stars Saif Ali Khan,Kunal Khemu,Vir Das and many many zombies.There is good chemistry between the friendly trio of Luv,Hardik and Bunny.There's lot of slapstick humor,plenty of boisterous moments.The trio attend a rave party in Goa where all goes wrong.Thanks to a drug,suddenly zombies are spawning out of the blue and they are hungry for any human they can find.The trio find themselves stranded on an island with zombies all around and no way out.Enter Saif Ali Khan as a Russian mafia Boris.Off late Saif's acting has really transcended to a new level of confidence and this role is an example of that.His character is just so amazing.His dialog delivery with that Russian accent,his intimidating yet adorable looks,his intriguing persona-are all things you will love about him.You get a kick within when he says with that Russian accent- 'I kill dead people'.The rest of the cast has acted pretty good as well and i liked Kunal Khemu's(Hardik) performance.There are plenty of genuinely funny moments.Don't try applying your mind too much or connecting the dots,this one is just meant for fun.Watch it and enjoy!",positive

Theeb,"Set during the Ottoman province of Hijaz during World War I, we meet a tribe of whom Theeb ('Wolf') is the son of the late Sheik. One night a friend arrives with a British officer seeking a guide across the desert. This turns out to be his brother's job but being an inquisitive young boy he sneaks along and so begins his coming of age.To say anymore might be a plot spoiler. This is an interesting film but it is not an action packed affair. There is a bit of action, but this is more psychological in how it deals with the extremes that befall the characters and how they deal with them. It has moments of tension and can be violent in places and I found a lot to praise in this UAE, Jordan, Qatari and British co production.In Arabic with a small amount of English, and good sub titles this is one of those films that will stay with you – but in a good way – recommended for World cinema fans.",negative
Theeb,"The film grabs a hold of you and does not let go until after the credits are finished rolling. The film is through the perspective of the young naive boy who has grown up in an isolated desert, he is curious, mischievous and then struggling to survive. Theeb succeeds in capturing the intelligence and the regality of Bedioun life that the Western gaze is incapable of doing. While this film is set during World War II, the war and conflicts are simply in the background, and the focus is on the tribal law and way of life of the nomadic, hospitable Bedouin. The film feels very authentic and well-researched. An epic coming of age story on boyhood, manhood, survival and code of ethics. Beautiful representation of the disappearing Bedouin way of life.",positive
Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods,"OK just to make it clear, the guys who reviewed it and gave it a 9 out of 10, aren't DBZ fans at all.I've loved that manga since early 90's, as a teenager, and loved all OVA (first broly being the best of them all) . I brought in a friend that is a huge fan too, relaxed, closed curtains, watched the movie... and we waited ; we waited for the story to skip the poor jokes and so on. Until I realised it was exactly designed the same way the previous Tarble anime was, poor humour, poor enemy's design, motivation, etc. The realisation is OK, but I really can't believe Akira Toriyama took part into that , and if so, I would be ultimately disappointed. How can people consider that to be a dragon ball movie, when there is only kawai fan service? Bills, is an absolutely empty shell character, the story is for kids. If you're over 10 , you might really be upset about this being called Dragon Ball. Only time we probably enjoyed was the overall 5-10 minutes fighting sequence, and that was really to say that something was still kind of brought back from the old DBZ and updated with today's technical improvements. So to summarize : if you're a real hardcore DBZ fan (meaning you didn't even wasted your time watching GT, as I did) , you'd better skip this movie, even if I know curiosity will prevail, but don't' have huge expectations, this is simply the WORST dragon ball movie I've ever seen. My buddy asked me seriously if that was a dragon ball parody movie or if it was real... Please Toei guys and Toriyama san , if you read that, please never do that again to your real fans. You just dealt a fatal blow to that magic manga that dragon ball is , and I'm not sure I'd go for a next movie if it's so bad. You have been warned guys.",negative
Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods,"Finally for all these days it came true, A new Dragon Ball Z Movie came up.I was so happy to hear the news for the first time, guess what? i was the one who requested and added this page to IMDb just to let the world know about the movie more and share its information as IMDb is the best for it.I love the Akira Toriyama's story in this, the battles so intense, loved watching it :D and the way story lines ended, seems as in Future we could see more of Dragon Ball Z, hoping for a new Series just like before and i am hearing rumors that there will be one? i believe there should be one as now we know there is 7 other Universe in it, wow hoping that there will be few more people like Goku who are just as or more powerful than him, Akira PLEASE WE WANT MORE!!!",positive
Astérix: Le domaine des dieux,"I was a big fan of the original ""Asterix"" comic books when I was a kid. Still am, as a matter of fact. So when I came across this French computer animated adaptation of the Asterix comic book ""The Mansion of the Gods"" on Netflix, I was curious to see how well it would be done. I still remember very well the particular Asterix comic book this movie adapted, and I have to say this adaptation is pretty well done. The second half of the movie pretty much stops following what happened in the comic book in order to do its own thing (and to stretch the story to feature length), but the changes to the story do feel straight out of a typical Asterix comic book. The humor (and there's plenty of it) has the exact tone, and happens to be pretty funny. The computer graphics don't quite have the Hollywood polish, but they are colorful and acceptably detailed. The only caution I would deliver to potential viewers is to inform them that they should read some of the original Asterix comics first before watching this movie, since there are some (minor) details that might be confusing for those not familiar with the comics.",negative
Astérix: Le domaine des dieux,It's everything a movie about Asterix should be.The spirit found in Uderzo & Goscinny works breathe true this movie. The subtle humor and those sweet eye winks like the authors always did in their books. The best Asterix animation to this day and trust me i've been a fan for 40 years. A total delight for the family and even for people who don't know Asterix world and the characters it will be easy to get to know them and have a lot of good laughs.I have been really please and surprise by this animation as all movies done about Asterix were not as authentic and enjoyable like this.I definitely wishing they do another one soon!!!,positive
Harlock: Space Pirate,"This review is nothing but spoilers. Read it or don't, but please don't watch this horrible movie. Below I detail Commander Kill Everyone's sincere efforts to single-handedly KILL EVERYONE.01. When you find out about government corruption destroy planet Earth and kill tens of billions of people.02. Pursue plan to DESTROY THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE which will kill hundreds of billions of people.03. Kill countless people on dozens of ships while executing the plan to destroy the universe.04. Scratch plan to destroy the universe.05. Perform attack that will kill countless people on dozens of ships to inform humanity that it may not be ENTIRELY doomed to extinction (but it probably is, and that's OK).",negative
Harlock: Space Pirate,"It is certainly not a film for children, because of some hidden contents and messages, and also for how some topics have been treated. Yet, Captain Harlock embodies an ideal of freedom that we all seek, since we are babies. For all our attempts to act in full autonomy, we are seen as ""different"" and judged, often condemned. This animated rendering film is a potential Digital Masterpiece, compelling and convincing. The job done by the creators is almost perfect. The attention is captured since the end, and the figure of Captain Harlock is seen by the eyes of the ""others"", and yet it's heavily present, in the Whole film! You must see it!",positive
"Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ""F""","If you are like me (a passionate DBZ fan who grew up diligently tuning in to every episode) then you'll be ashamed with how this latest instalment scars the legacy created during our childhood. There's getting it wrong and then there's getting it horribly incorrect and DBZ have achieved the latter with this time waster, if you asked me to describe it in 3 words they'd be 'rushed, sloppy' I know that's only 2 words but in truth this film doesn't deserve a third word, it also didn't deserve my attention for however long I spent pushing my eyes towards suicide. I can only think that this was directed and funded by people who dislike DBZ, that would describe the plot with unforgivable holes all over the place and the so called action which is dreadful and painful to watch, Goku probably needs to sue DBZ for terrible misrepresentation of his character. Anyone that says this rushed, unchoreographed, pathetic excuse of a film is good would've been paid a big fee to say so, I can honestly say the best part of this film is the credits, retire now DBZ!!!",negative
"Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ""F""","This is the Dragon Ball Z Movie experience I always wanted. While Battle of Gods was an amazingly fun light-hearted adventure, this is the badass action-packed DBZ that we wanted since the Cell Saga.Goku and Vegeta have now ascended to Gods with Whis as their new master. I absolutely loved the exploration of Goku and Vegeta's character dynamics and development throughout the training scenes, with Whis not only being a physical mentor but a spiritual one as well. Bills provides much of the comedy in his own unique manner as one of the best new DBZ Characters ever. Speaking of new characters, I'm pleasantly surprised by Frieza's new minions, especially Sorbet as he's actually useful throughout the movie and not just fodder like the rest of Frieza's army. The invasion scene was amazing as it put the Z warriors back in the spotlight and gave the movie some much-needed tension. Especially Gohan; not since his fight with Cell has he been this badass!Speaking of badassery, the very definition of the word, Vegeta, finally gets his time to really shine (there are no stupid bingo scenes in this one...) - it is straight up brawls in that over-the-top fashion we all know and love delivered by the Prince of all Saiyans.In the end, the 15th DBZ Film featured the return of the greatest Anime villain of all time: Frieza in a Battle of Gods with the Super Saiyan God Goku. It's just classic!",positive
Madaari,"This is such a powerful film, and not just a film, but a powerful statement. The plot of the film deals with a man who has lost the only thing in life that is dear to him.As a single parent, Nirmal Kumar(Irrfan Khan) life is fulfilled by caring for this little boy. All the spare time he has he spends with his son, playing with him and teaching him. On one occasion his son remarked about the whereabouts of his mother and he said that she left him for a career in the United States. However Nirmal's life is shattered by an unforeseen calamity. I will not reveal more - you will have to see this brilliant film directed by an extraordinary director: Nishikant Kamat. I have already seen his previous films: Force(2011), Drishyam(2015) and Rocky Handsome(2016). I have also seen him act in the film 404(2011). I have mentioned again and again how impressed I am with Irrfan Khan's steady rise in Bollywood. He is becoming the undisputed people's champion with films like these. I enjoyed his performance in Billu Barber(2009) and again in The Lunchbox(2013). In this film he is at the pinnacle of his acting prowess. He has managed to make tears fall from my eyes at many points in this film. This is a powerful psychological drama and very relevant in today's world. The effect new digital technology is making in spreading information quickly around the world is shown in this film. Smartphones are by the billion in India, and then we have the newer iPads. So technology wise, a lot has changed in India. The age-old problem of government corruption in India is re-emphasized. Before I forget, I would like to mention the superb music in the film by the veteran music director Pritam. He has directed music in such hits like Dhoom(2004), Gangster(2006), Jab We Met(2007), Race(2008) and Bajrangi Bhaijaan(2015).More film recommendations: Aakhree Raasta(1986), Hatya(1988), Dayavan (1988), Prahaar: The Final Attack(1991), Indian(1996), Yeshwant(1997).Very special mention Kireedam(1989). This blockbuster film was remade in Hindi as Gardish(1993) directed by Priyadarshan. Kireedam has a sequel film Chenkol(1993) which was never dubbed or remade in Hindi.",negative
Madaari,"It's a gem of a movie, largely carried on by Irrfan Khan and an expressive chunk of kid (Vishesh Bansal) & grit of Jimmy Shergill (he is wasted though). The depiction of Father-Son relation is directed beautifully ...u can actually fall for them In here Irrfan doesn't try to be the one man army fighting against the system unlike almost all vigilante justice movie, instead he lets the situation, grief and purpose drive the movie with his exceptional acting (among the best v have seen) especially the post- accident hospital sequence is gut wrenching. The dialogues carry punch and tears apart our psyche.Nishikant Kamath's best direction after Mumbai Meri Jaan, though the movie falls short at some instances but they are well overlapped by Irrfan Khan's brilliance If you loved A Wednesday u will admire MadaariP.S: it is a shame that such movie will hardly gather 10% of what BRAINLESS movies earn this days... no doubt we are living in denial !!!",positive
Mohenjo Daro,"Same ol story, A simple farmer who saves a beautiful girl and falls in love with her. He then must challenge and fight against overwhelming odds. We come to know that the city is ruled by a tyrant n his son is engaged to the same girl.1)Puzzling why this film is set in the Indus Valley Civilization, given the alarming lack of attention to detail. I will not get much into historical inaccuracies but jus a few laughable inaccuracies. 2)Characters seem to have found razors n scissors. Nicely trimmed sideburns, hair n moustaches. 3)Lead actress is tribal only in her headdress. With her headdress, she looks more like Santanico pandemonium from Dusk till dawn. Her thigh-high slit skirt is straight from the red carpet. 3)Majority of historians agree that females had bangles all the way up their arms and nothing else on bodies. 4)The story is set in 2016 BC, thousands of years prior before the world's first gymnasium was invented. Lead actor is ripped with lean muscles. 5)Now coming to Hrithiks acting. He has been the same in every character he has played in each of his films. Same ol lean muscles, same hair style n same accent. His cheeks shake when he's angry, and his voice becomes ever more pronounced while expressing rage. These are all traits the actor displayed in his debut film, 'Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai', and which remain unchanged 16 years. The same was in Agneepath n Bang bang. 6)Something to laugh about- our hero Hrithik wrestles a rubber crocodile. Badly done. 7)The fights in the colosseum. Wow man. Gladiators in mohenjo daro. Still very badly done. 8)Horses in mohenjo??? This movie is an epic disaster of biblical proportions. Boring, full of clichés. The editin is bad, screenplay is one of the worst, acting was horrible by all except Kabir bedis. The direction is pathetic n very dull n stale cinematography.",negative
Mohenjo Daro,"Mohenjo Daro, starring Hrithik Roshan and Pooja Hegde is a period drama based on ancient Indian civilization, which the whole country feels proud about. The movie showcases the life and day to day activities of ancient times and also revolves around a story of a peasant (Hrithik) who falls in love with a Princess (Pooja). The film has all the elements to entertain the audiences such as old world charm, never seen before spectacles and backdrops, a twist of love, romance and action. The film's action scenes will keep you at the edge of your seat. If ancient civilization excites you, then this film is a must watch under all terms. Director: Ashutosh GowarikarCast: Hrithik Roshan, Pooja Hegde Plot: Mohenjo Daro is set in 2016 BC and showcases ancient Indian civilization in all its glory. Hrithik (Sarman) who plays the role of a simple farmer, lands himself in the town of Mohenjo Daro and is mesmerized by its beauty and grandeur. Sarman comes to the city with a hidden agenda and works as a peasant. During a street mishap he saves the life of Princess Chaani and ends up falling in love with her. Chaani is the chosen one to serve 'Sindhu Ma' who is a river Goddess, and the whole city is very devoted to her. Trouble starts when Sarman abandons his hidden agenda and tries to woo Chaani, but falls afoul to the politician Maham (Kabir Bedi) who wants to rule Mohenjo Daro all by himself as a dictator. Maham's son Moonja, does his best to make Sarman go off route and uses him as a pawn so that his father can seize control of the whole city. To win over Chaani, Sarman has to defeat Maham & Moonja and save the city from destruction at the evil hands of the father-son duo. Will Sarman save the town from the evil whims of Maham & Moonja? Or will he unleash his hidden agenda and destroy the city all by himself? Can he win over the love of his life Chaani? For that you will have to hit the theatres! We're sure you'll never be disappointed. Performances: Hrithik Roshan is back with a bang and has delivered a stellar performance in Mohenjo Daro. His acting skills are on full display and he has pulled off an excellent feat with this one. The dedication he has poured into the action scenes are immense and he has done justice to his role overall. Coming to Pooja Hegde, the actress has managed to pull off both 'sweet and mean' avatars in the film. She can mesmerize you by her sheer beauty and can make you sit at the edge of your seat during her fight scenes. There's no doubt that Pooja Hegde is here to stay in Bollywood and Mohenjo Daro will be an epitome of her success. Technicalities: Ashutosh Gowariker has a lot of experience when it comes to period drama films and has left no stone unturned when it comes to Mohenjo Daro. The ancient city is shown perfectly the way it should be and the larger than life sets will leave you amazed. The film takes you back all the way to 2016 BC and will make you believe that whatever is shown on screen is so damn true. Such is the charismatic work of the film-maker and kudos to him for pulling off such a spectacular feat. The camera angles focus on every inch of the city and its all woven together really well. Thumbs up to the team of Mohenjo Daro on this one! Verdict: A must watch! These kind of movies come rarely in Bollywood and Mohenjo Daro should never be missed at any cost. There is love, drama, action, romance and to top it all, there is an ancient civilization shown so perfectly that you'll end up falling in love with it.I will rate Mohenjo Daro 9 out of 10!! Go and watch",positive
Copenhagen,"The problem with this movie is the main character. He becomes very hard to watch after 20 minutes or so as he apparently has no redeeming qualities. I don't mind an unlikeable character at all, in the hands of a great director and a great actor, but Will just grates on the nerves. For the whole movie.
If the script had gone through two or three more re-writes, they might have had something here. But aside from an interesting performance from Frederikke Dahl Hansen, (a 20 year old actress playing a 14 year old character)....this movie just has nothing to offer. It just kinds of meanders until its very predictable, very unsatisfying conclusion.",negative
Copenhagen,"***warning, possible spoilers*** this movie should be studied in film classes: you watch it, enjoy it, but don't really realize the effectiveness of the writer and director until later. Here is what happens: 1. An analogy best explains this film: we have all probably seen a video of a master with his dog. Sitting in front of the dog is the most delectable treat imaginable to the dog. The dog does nothing even though every fiber of its being wants to gobble up that treat. It is waiting for its masters command. The Masters here are the writer and director, the dog is the male lead. The girl is the treat (and not in a prurient sense). She says she will be 15 (the age of consent) ""in a few days"". He wants to pounce (But not in a sexual sense even though there is obvious physical attraction). 2. The age difference is not for shock value. It is a very effective plot device relating to 1 above. 3. They are alone in a hotel room, both drunk (largely at his insistence). She is the aggressor. The reality is he cannot believe she is only 14 and repeatedly says that throughout the movie. She tries to seduce him, taking off her blouse and kissing him which he appears to accept. 4. The ""masters"" do not outright state that they did not sleep together but instead, more effectively, make that clear by: they both wake up in bed fully clothed (she must have put her top back on) in sharp contrast to his other many dalliances where he graphically wakes up with a naked partner; just prior to this he turns down an offer that most males his age dream about – two beautiful drunk girls try to drag him back to their hotel for a threesome. Instead of going with the women, he is much more concerned about having hurt the girl's feelings and rushes out of the bar, leaving the women, to try to call the girl and apologize for acting like a jerk. So, the attraction is not about sex per se. there is much more to his feelings for the girl and he is clearly conflicted. He does not sleep with her.5. There is more to him than meets the eye: he is in Denmark to find his grandfather and understand why he was abandoned by his father. The girl, with a great heart and overlooking the fact that he is superficially an insensitive jerk sees something deeper in him and embraces the cause of him finding his past and takes it upon herself to help him. 6. The girl, is far more substantial and mature than the women he has been sleeping with (who is really older, the girl or his earlier partners?). She too, has a troubled family but is very close to her mother and wants to help him resolve that part of his life. 7. In one effective scene, he simply glances down a street and sees a father briefly interacting with his son (short and effective). 8. The most effective scene in the movie: she takes him to a museum. She brings him to a dark corner where there is a bust. She tells him she has never brought anyone there before. She stands next to the bust. It is an exact image of the girl. She tells him she is really hundreds of years old and he says the bust is 1500 years old. This scene is a metaphor for what the movie accomplishes. After 1500 years, here she (who posed for the bust) is here again, resurrected, with the human traits that allowed us to survive over those 1500 years: the yearning for family, love, and a striving for happiness even in an imperfect world. In other hands this might seem corny, here it is movie-making genius.",positive
Tiger Zinda Hai,"These are a few scenes which killed my neurons:
1) Salman's entry scene with wolves is funny and his kid is irritating.
2) As the number of terrorist soldiers increased, Salman switched to bigger guns. At one point, there were 200 soldiers and our hero picked the biggest gun he can find, stood at one place and kept shooting. FYI these 200 soldiers were also shooting back but surprisingly they all missed.
3) They portrayed a big villain in the movie, which of course required a big plot for him to go down. Throughout the movie he was seen with hundreds of soldiers at his disposal but as the movie came to an end and it was high time the villain was killed, they showed him roaming around Salman with just a knife.
4) To kill salman (who was tied to a chair), the villian didn't shoot him. He put him in a room full of toxic gas, asked his men to wear gas mask and then go inside and shoot him.
5) Salman and Katrina escaped a whole city under airstrike, within 3 SECONDS. 
6) Dialogues were written by a kid. Villain: Tu mujhe rokk ke dikha. Salman: Dum hai toh tu mujhe rokk ke dikha.
7) Salman's colleague tells him that it was impossible to diffuse the bomb (tells him twice). Salman tells him, its a matter of country's pride and his colleague diffuses it within seconds.
8) Action scenes had several explosions, most of them happened in empty cars with no enemy around. Didn't understand the director's obsession with exploding empty cars. 
9) Whole movie was formula based: Take what work's best for Indian audience (fuck logic/acting/talent).This list can go on. In simple words, whole movie was bleh. To many of the body builders, single guys/one sided lovers, Muslim youths and others.... please stop being a blind fan.",negative

Earth to Echo,"This movie was cheaply made, along the lines of Paranormal Activity, web cam horror flicks, etc. As has been stated by several other reviewers, it is a cheap knock-off of E.T. We were misled by the poster, which made us feel it would be a great movie for our 7 yr old. NOT! The movie had the characters in bars, teen parties with kissing and alcohol consumption, etc.Parental concerns aside, the movie was nothing more than a hurried, choppy view from a portable cam. Save your money and watch a Youtube video...which is what this 'movie' really was.",negative
Earth to Echo,"When my friends and I were watching this I notice how this was not really our adult style since it seemed like the whole time the kid was filming. Also we didn't really find it all too much exciting of watching but my sister and her friends absolutely loved it! They were laughing a lot by making jokes and they thought the little echo robot was adorable. The part when Munch chases after the truck the girls were joking about when they were calling out for him like ""Munch Munch Munch!"" As in the sound effects of eating. I did laugh along since I have the personality of a kid but I would recommend this movie for teens and kids at sleepovers or get togethers rather than for adults to watch.",positive
Rurouni Kenshin Part II: Kyoto Inferno,"The first live-action installment of Rurouni Kenshin judiciously cut several arcs from the original manga and anime story to deliver a tight, cohesive narrative that built up to a satisfying conclusion — even if it did reveal a few late-story secrets far, far too early. The first half of a two-part follow-up, Rurouni Kenshin: Kyoto Inferno (a.k.a. Kyoto Taika-hen) suffers by failing to take the same discretion with the source material, choosing instead to mirror the manga's episodic, drawn- out build-up to the decisive confrontation between Himura Kenshin (Takeru Sato, a former Kamen Rider) and Makoto Shishio (Tatsuya Fujiwara of Battle Royal and Deathnote fame). This film could easily have worked as a televised miniseries, with a sense of minor resolution every twenty minutes or so as a greater, unifying threat loomed in the background. But as a singular arc, Rurouni Kenshin: Kyoto Inferno lacks any cohesive build or pay-off as Kenshin wanders from one seemingly arbitrary encounter to the next. A plea for help. An assassinated official. A stolen sword. A village in peril. A search for a swordsmith. A plot to burn Kyoto. A desperate rescue. An open-ended conclusion. And between each burst of choreographed violence, a ream of static exposition that would nearly send George Lucas looking for an editor.The story partly suffers from its need to play clean-up to some first- film decisions. Hajime Saito (Yosuke Eguchi) has already been introduced as an unambiguous ally, and although he's allowed to display more badassery this time around, the film lacks the taut-wire tension between Kenshin and the ex-Shinsen Gumi leader that formed the backbone of the manga's sensational Kyoto arc (Saito's opening face-to-face with Shishio is also a bit silly, largely resembling an outtake from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom). The film also struggles to introduce Aoshi Shinomori (Yusuke Iseya, who was interesting in Casshern back in 2004). While wisely excluded from the first film — another semi-villain would have just been too much — cramming all of his development into an expository sub-story this time around fails to do justice to one of the series' most compelling characters. By the time he faces off with Kashiwazaki Nenji (Min Tanaka), the ostensible leader of the Oniwa Banshu ninja group (translated here as The Watchers), we really haven't had time to get to know him or care about his goals.One standout, however, is Tao Tsuchiya, who's delightful to watch as Oniwa Banshu ninja Makimachi Misao. While her attempts at anime-style spunk don't quite work, her full-throttle wire-assisted combat displaces enough bamboo to evoke positive memories of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Ryunosuke Kamiki (voice of Bo in Spirited Away and Marukuru in Howl's Moving Castle) similarly sets up an effectively creepy Sojiro Seta, though in a film crammed with so many new characters, we don't quite get to know who he is so much as simply what he does.As for the remainder of the supporting cast from the first film, they are almost entirely cut from the runtime, appearing only during Kenshin's should-I-go-to-Kyoto quandary at the opening and then again at the end. This leaves Kenshin meandering the middle arc as an arbitrary avenger, with only an incidental connection to the travesties Shishio creates around him — and repeated scenes of women and children weeping extravagantly over dead bodies feels more desperate than driving. With Sato's portrayal of Kenshin predominantly set to glower, we don't get a clear sense of the radical shift between his carefree and killer states, and it's unclear which moments truly resonate with the reformed assassin.The action sequences are exceptionally well-choreographed, and generally fun to watch. But with so many featuring hero-vs-the-world stuntman slaughter, tension is quickly lost. While there are fits of incidental action, there are only two big one-on-one fights for the title character, and the second, though Bourne-like in its innovative use of tight spaces, involves an antagonist we barely know and who only serves to mechanically set up the next plot point (He's also done up a little too ridiculously for a live-action villain — another area where deviation from the source material would have been wise). Taken on the whole, the film feels like watching only the first quarter of Kill Bill Volume 1 stretched to 139 minutes. Much sound and fury, signifying little — and even a citywide battle in the penultimate arc seems arbitrary and unearned. Having gone through so many unrelated minor objectives, the stakes are unclear and the emotional investment isn't there. Perhaps this will all be put paid in the second half, promised in September. But until then, this Rurouni Kenshin feels long on tease and short on delivery.(Disclosure: I got to play the first plummeting body in the video for One OK Rock's Mighty Long Fall, the film's closing theme.)",negative
Rurouni Kenshin Part II: Kyoto Inferno,"I am deeply surprised. I was expecting a really bad adaptation, as it has been done before. This movie however is great. If you grew up watching the anime you will be pleased, as it brings to life the right personality of the characters. They even have that goofiness Himura always showed whenever he was surrounded by the ones he loved. But shifting right back to some cold heart determined killer that awarded him his nickname. The fighting scenes, were tremendous. None of that ""shaking camera"" BS that Hollywood vomits on us. Really well done.The filming and editing are sublime. I could easily notice on one of the big fights (wont spoil it for you), the still burning ashes floating around the scene, giving me instant flashbacks to the anime. Really nice touch. And the opening scene of Shishio and Saito is tremendous.The action is great. Himura is perfectly portrayed, with all of his goofy nuances, deep honor, shame, guilt, and killer instinct. And the same can be said of the remaining characters. Sanosuke is as obnoxious and lovable as ever. And Sojiro is perfectly depicted in his psychopath childish assassin persona. I feel like i could show this movie to people that have never seen the anime, and they would still love it. Great work guys.",positive
Tarzan,"Bad plot, awful human animations... in all a waste of my time.Predictable story line you know all the things that will happen before they do. The mix some people are doing on topics is absurd... kind of the Cowboys and Aliens movie !! what a joke and here meteors, extinction of the dinosaurs, and Tarzan?? The other thing that was just enough for me was the gorilla behavior, even they seem to know how to use a knife (and the meaning of it for a kill) and to open a door... truly people?!! This types of movies are a slap to your intellect... please do not waste your time like I did mine, hope producers and writers could give me back the hour I could stand of this nonsense.",negative
Tarzan,"Not sure why so many negatives about this version, the 3d was awesome the story was excellent, well paced, not a kiddie movie maybe that was it people wanted a kiddie version. not every animated movie has to be a Pixar or disney!!, watch without prejudice and if you can watch it in 3d please do!!!",positive
The Boy and the Beast,"Based on his wonderful films Wolf Children, The Girl Who Stepped Through Time, and Summer Wars, I've been thinking of Mamoru Hosoda as the heir apparent to Hayao Miyazaki, not because they're that stylistically similar but because both make beautiful, very human movies that give me joy. But The Boy and the Beast isn't anywhere near the level of his previous films.In premise alone, this film is far less interesting, falling into the clichéd reluctant-master-rebellious-student rut. Teacher teaches student, student teaches teacher, helpful sidekicks comment on the action, and it's all leading to the big fight.None of which is particularly bad, and the movie is perfectly enjoyable, but towards the end things go off the rails as a new storyline is awkwardly tossed in and a lot of new information is offered far too late in the game. It feels like two or three bits of movies were poorly welded together.Whether the reviews on IMDb are positive or negative, reviewers declare this beautifully animated, but while the animation is fine, there was little in it that was exceptional.Since Hosada's One Piece debut, every movie he has made was more wonderful than the one that preceded it. I can only hope that this is a stumble, not a fall, and that his next movie will be a return to his earlier brilliance.",negative
The Boy and the Beast,"Now with this movie finally getting an official release of course it has to open the same weekend as Zootopia (haven't seen but will review soon) which is killing the box office, while the Boy and the Beast had a total of 4 people in the theatre, two of which were me and my friend, and although I'm sure Zootopia is great, there needs to be love for this movie too! Japan is currently kicking anyones but in the animation department, and this film is nothing short of that, it looks beautiful almost every scene. The story it self is a simple one but the characters were so intriguing that it helped the story so much, basically a quick sum of the plot is there is a beast world and a human wanders into it to train with one of the beast, and as I mentioned I'm sure you are thinking that this is such an unoriginal plot, which in a way it is nothing new, but again you care about the characters so much that it throughly enhances the story, and the story actually has a great side plot. If you need something to watch this weekend I'm sure Zootopia is great for the family, but The Boy in The Beast is great for anyone, as it isn't too ""anime"" for the average person. Mamoru Hosoda really has quite a talent and with Miyazaki retiring I think he is going to cement himself as the best in animated films for years to come.So to sum things up definitely see the Boy and the Beast, it is a fantastic time age range: 10+ score: 10/10 would recommend to go watch",positive
Bilal: A New Breed of Hero,"So you get 3 instead! Thank you Barajoun Entertainment for making up for the film's dryness on screen by introducing one of the most entertaining IMDb pages in a long time, Please don't stop!I do not wish to repeat what others have said about your magnificent PR campaign, not only in IMDb but also in your social network websites, but it does show sad desperation instead of letting the movie speak for itself and leave the judgement to the audience.I will bet my Kentucky horses that it's the same fellow with the same broken English with the same justifications here. At least change the method so it won't be that noticeable. Introduce unique plot twists and expressions.You think people don't know how easy it is to buy votes and reviews in international channels, good for you though, thankfully there were a few genuine and non bought reviews that unfortunately wiped the floor with the film. Just like the US presidential Campaign of 2016, a few dollars can go a long way in the media of a capitalistic world. Even they lost when it came to the people it seems.No wonder the story and the film turned up the way it did when you don't even have half of the imagination to write a few diverse reviews in these pages.",negative
Bilal: A New Breed of Hero,"Bilal is the biggest first ever animated movie created in middle east till date.Spectacular visuals and strong characterization are some of the key factors of this movie. its production of established animation studio in UAE.The efforts and top notch work standard can be easily seen on the screen.Every character in film is crafted very well. Well voice overs for each character putting more life in them. its like introduction of the part of history.The movie is a fascinating glimpse into an important period in the history of the region, and the attention to detail paid to the costumes and backgrounds gives an authentic impression of the historical.

Walking with Dinosaurs 3D,"Well I like millions of others love the idea of learning about dinosaurs, from children to the elderly there is just something fascinating about them. I am far from a palaeontologist, my love has come from having toys as a kid, TV shows and the Jurassic Park series, so I was so excited to see this film.I'm not sure why but I assumed a film being released on Boxing Day would be a guaranteed classic, boy was I wrong. I wont spoil the so called ""plot"" of this film, as I don't think that's fair to people who want to see it.The positives are there though, the animation and the effects are genuinely beautiful and the fact there were elements of learning in the movie is a nice added bonus especially for children. The first annoyance I had and this may sound a little cheap is that I didn't and most wont recognise any of the dinosaurs in this film, they look familiar but none of the ""classic"" or ""well known"" dinosaurs are here.The dinosaurs do have voices, but unlike any good animation film they didn't have vocal movements on the characters, all of it was dubbed over the action and sometimes it was hard to work out who was actually talking, that was my biggest complaint, something I felt was a lazy move by the creator.The plot is horrendous and extremely dull, it would have been a good hour show on the television on the discovery channel if the voices weren't there. None of the characters are that interesting and they make a very lame attempt to make the lead come across endearing and someone who you want to back for success, sadly he isn't, the film has poor character development and most of the characters are one dimensional and very irritating.I loved watching the dinosaurs and found some of it educational, but this film would have been better without the poor voices and done as an experience of the amazement that dinosaurs bring rather than a very poor story. Kids wont enjoy the story any better, I'm a huge kid film fan but this is just not a good watch.I'd recommend buying this when its in the bargain bin in a local shop and watch it without sound, just to appreciate the effects and the wonder of that era.What a waste of potential!!!",negative
Walking with Dinosaurs 3D,"Disclaimer: I marked my review as having spoilers, despite the fact that the plot is as predicable as the phases of the moon, because I ""revealed"" plot details even though you will undoubtedly know them the instant the story begins.I caught the original ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" documentary when it first aired in 2000. It was a truly groundbreaking experience, combing state-of-the-art CGI with nature documentary-style storytelling in a television program. It has held up over the years quite well, and was followed by equally-good sequels including ""Prehistoric Beasts"" and ""Monsters"".Fast forward 13 years later, and we now have a motion picture based on the name. A brand new ""Walking with Dinosaurs"", set on following the life of a Pachyrhinosaurus as he braves the Prehistoric Alaskan wilderness, encountering other dinosaurs such as the predatory Gorgosaurus and the giant, but gentle, Edmontonia, all told with beautiful cinematography and top-notch CGI.That sounds great, right? Well, what happened BBC? What the hell happened? I feel like I've been treated like an idiot. Walking With Dinosaurs: The Movie has zero charm, annoying and atrocious voice overs, a bare bones plot straight out of The Land Before Time, except without the emotion or drama, and a completely pointless frame story about a kid, his sister, and his uncle (as modern day humans, annoyingly) digging for fossils.It seems the filmmakers were originally intending on making this film a docudrama in the style of the original, and this would have been great. We would have really been invested in the individual dinosaurs as we followed them through their lives, and it would have been really immersive and engaging.But nope. Someone somewhere down the line decided that we needed half-assed, and rushed, voice overs to be able to know what the dinosaurs are thinking/doing, because apparently the studio executives think that audiences cannot understand body language, or the fact that film is a visual medium first and foremost. But given all the flak aimed at films like Avatar and Pacific Rim, they might be justified in that assumption. But the fact is is that we are smarter than that, and there was no reason to add these voice overs other than the pander to the lowest common denominator.And the fact that the voice overs sound like they were added late in production only serves to drive the point home. It sounds like the voice actors were not reading off of script, but rather watching the film and trying to do their dialogue in real time, like a bunch of 12-year old youtube commentators trying to be funny by adding voices to silent characters or animals. Then there is the fact that their is no lip-synching whatsoever. None.The story is a shadow of the plot used in Land Before Time. Main character hatches from egg and is raised by parent, his dad dies protecting him from a predator in the midst of a natural disaster (a wildfire this time around), he grows up, deals with hardships, falls in love, and comes back to beat those pesky predators, while winning the girl of his dreams. That is all there is to the plot. You cannot get any more by-the-numbers than that in this day and age.The humor is awful, because the 10-year old that wrote this script must have had some fascination with butt jokes and derivatives. Our main character has a hole in his head where the hole in the skull is, on the right side (left side in the promotional materials, for some reason). Gaze in amazement as every joke about his ""nice hole"" comes out as sounding like forced innuendo in a script that makes Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen look like a Christopher Nolan masterpiece.The music is a mixed bag. On one hand, the music used for the first Pachy migration sequence and the Edmontosaurus migration were pretty decent and fitting, and then there pop songs. In a dinosaur film. Why.Enough ranting already. The visuals are nothing short of spectacular, featuring gorgeous photography of the Alaskan geography as brilliantly-rendered dinosaurs and pterosaurs frolic amongst the landscape, with attention to detail paid in footprints and the animation.Unfortunately, anything the film gets right is immediately drown out by the ear-grating voice overs and juvenile script that serves only to pander to the youngest portion of the viewer base. Walking With Dinosaurs may be a treat for the youngsters, but older viewers who actually posses a legitimate interest in paleontology will be turned off and left confused and enraged.",positive
Reign of the Supermen,"Hated it! Hated it! Hated it!
The original writers of this story (Dan Jurgens, Karl Kesel, Jerry Ordway, Louise Simonson & Roger Stern) should be pissed. DC butchered this completely. I expected so much more and was sadly disappointed.
The original Death & Return of Superman (back in 1992 &'93) was one of the best Superman stories I have ever read and this paled in comparison. They ruined the story, they ruined the original villain (who was a GREAT villain who would never do someone else bidding) and turned him into an underling. Then they used lazy writing to add a new villain that had absolutely nothing to due with the source material.
I thought they had learned something from their 1st attempt at this with Superman/ Doomsday dvd in 2007 but I guess I was wrong.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!!!
I encourage anyone who wants a great Superman story to find the original story in the Return of Superman trade paperback or the novel The Death & Life of Superman by Roger Stern (the novel does include the battle with Doomsday). Both are incredible. It might take you a little longer to read it but it will be worth it.",negative

Resident Evil: Vendetta,"Boring, predictable, shallow, over the top, ridiculous. The worst animated movie of the series, as bad as Anderson's movies. The only good thing is the impressive CGI, animations and details are really incredible. The rest is totally pointless. Basic plot line, one dimensional characters, absurd and not realistic situations. Plot is the same story told over and over again over the games: new villain spreads a virus, heroes fight zombies, heroes fight a final boss and save the city. There is absolutely no twist or a new focus on story that could make it more interesting.Only recommended for Resident Evil hardcore fans, casual viewers be warned: this is a total waste of time.",negative
Resident Evil: Vendetta,"I went to the one night only premiere of Resident Evil: Vendetta tonight the third C.G.I. motion picture movie of Resident Evil and I can honestly say is the best of the three.The movie deliver in more ways than one that fans of the Resident Evil series will super appreciate.First off we got to talk about how amazing the movie looks this is some of the most Phenomenal animation works I ever saw the characters and environments are so realistic that you can often forget that you're watching a Computer Generated Animated Movie the movie crew hired actors for motion capture to show case how real the characters look and move on screen they all deserve points for doing such a great job to make the movie look so great.The voice acting is top notch with in my opinion the voice work and characters Chris Redfield (Voiced by Kevin Dorman) Rebecca Chambers (Voiced by Erin Cahill) Leon S.Kennedy (Voiced by Matthew Mercer) Glenn Arias (Voiced by John DeMita)bringing great performances that really shows amazing work it makes you feel like you really watching a drama play done so well the voice work the cast does is so well done with the writing being very smart the writers took their time that's for sure.The story really is powerful throughout with the writing again being well through out. The cast performances also helps the story makes you draw into the plot to wonder what will happen next.The action in the movie is awesome it felt like you're playing the game and the effects are impressive barely enough time to rest as the action keeps you on the edge of your seat as you wait to see what goes on next.The only thing this movie needs is a mic drop because it really show why Resident Evil has had such a success the movie is made for fans of movies and Resident Evil. I will no doubt be glad to watch this movie over and over again.With amazing C.G.I Animation,Excellent Voice acting, Strong powerful story and action that leaves your jaw drop you really will love this movie.I give Resident Evil: Vendetta an 10 out of 10",positive
Trash,"As if the country of Brazil didn't have enough problems with the Zika virus nowadays, they are apparently plagued with being the setting for this abominable film.Ruinporn Christian propaganda with painfully awkward white-brown race interactions where a trash-picking gang of urchins wade their way through sewage and parkour over their quaint dump-shanty favela while evading swarms of riot gear-clad policemen to solve the mystery of the dump-scavenged wallet. Did I mention the kids all hang out with the local white English-speaking missionaries? Heaps of overt bible-themed symbolism slopped onto this whole salvation quest still don't stop the grail at the end of the rainbow from being filled with a huge wad of cash. Incidentally, contains some of the most hamfistedly anti-police imagery I've seen in a while. Still quite an awful piece of work.",negative
Trash,"A brilliantly exciting film from start to finish. The three boys are a triumph, and the way the film handles them, and uses their emotional closeness, their friendship, is a credit to Director Stephen Daldry and his crew, as well as to the three boys themselves, recruited from the streets of Brazil. The story jumps from one level of excitement to the next in a series of clever set pieces that, at the same time as they increase the tension to almost unbearable levels, answer the questions raised by the mystery; what exactly is the significance of what the boys find, as they comb through the giant mountains of trash, trying to earn enough to eat from recycling plastic and tin? The chase scenes through the favelas are exhilarating. Literally, you find yourself talking out loud. The film is a celebration of Andy Mulligan's stunning novel of the same name.",positive
Welcome to the Jungle,"Very bad modern parody of a great book: ""Lord of the flies"". Don't even worth to be seen for free... Lets say that Van Damme character is Simon (not a nice Simon as in the book but...); Adam Brody is Ralph and Rob Huebel is Jack. Also, Kristen Schaal is Piggy and Aaron Takahash Roger. Kristopher Van Varenberg could be the twins... who knows... Out of the Island, Phil (Huebel) is Chris (Brody)'s boss. He's an abusive boss, seconded by his right hand, Troy (Takahash). As the manager of the company feels his employees are not team players, he send them to an island to bond. The plane lands, the pilot dies and a very boring parody of ""Lord of the flies"" begins... It's not funny, it's not entertaining, it's just a waste of time.",negative

I thought all the actors did a great job, but I especially loved seeing JCVD do something different. Turns out, he's a pretty funny guy. I guess if you were expecting him to throw out a few karate kicks, that might be a let down. But I walked in just hoping to be entertained, and I definitely was. I don't watch that many comedies, so when I see one I like to laugh, not walk away more depressed than when I sat down.

Mary and the Witch's Flower,"This got three stars because it does have beautiful animation and they did a really amazing magical land but outside of that nothing about it was that good. The story fell flat and became contradictory. I was waiting for something to happen and to be excited but that feeling never came. There were two plots in the film that we're completely contradictory. First she shows up at the school and the headmistress is like ""we have been watching you for a long time now"" but also doesn't know she's the niece of the woman who tried to destroy her or that she has never used magic before that day? What?Second being Mary has a set amount of magic? And she's constantly 'almost out' but can still destroy an entire science lab when she's suppose to be completely out? And how does everyone around her know how much magic she has left and not her? And how does she have a limited amount of magic when her aunt is this powerful witch?Music didn't stand out as either amazing or dull just eh.Characters and dialoge was also so flat. Seriously just plain awful at points.",negative
Mary and the Witch's Flower,"Just came back from the one time only screening of this movie in Austin TX. I'm a bit confused by the super-negative reviews of this film. I guess people were expecting a film on par with past Studio Ghibli movies? Lets be real here, as sad as it is, the age of Studio Ghibli is over, unless Hayao Miyazaki decides to return to the directors seat and make another full-length feature film. Which at this point seems unlikely. The fact that we have a studio like Ponoc to carry on the torch of 2D animated projects in the style of Gibli should be celebrated I think. I went into this movie not expecting it to be on par with any of Studio Ghibli's past works, yes it's no Howl's Moving Castle or Spirited Away. I did enjoy Mary and the Witch's Flower more so than Miyazaki's last two films, The Wind Rises and Ponyo. The only other Hiromasa Yonebayashi films I've seen was Arriety, never saw When Marine Was There. I do think this film is better than Arriety was.Mary and the Witches Flower looks like a Studio Ghibli film, the character animation is really great, the backgrounds, while reminiscent of past Ghibli works are nice, but not on the same level of detail, which was fine to me. The characters and the story is good, again, not as solid as past Ghibli works, but I enjoyed it overall. The biggest thing lacking to be was a musical score from Joe Hisaishi, but he has never done music for a Hiromasa Yonebayashi film. The last film he composed music for was The Princess Kaguya, which was a big deal. I'm getting off-track here, but the last I will say is that is if you are a fan of Studio Ghibli, and are yearning to see a full-length feature film in traditional 2D animation, go see this film if you are able to, just don't go in expecting it to be as good as one of the Studio Ghibli classics.",positive
Journey to the West,"Warning: Spoilers This movie is a disaster with its horribly random script, flat characters, terrible CGI, and an unbelievable romance.So let's talk SCRIPT. This should be easy, because there isn't one. The story follows the exploits of a young demon hunter as he hunts down three demons: water and pig demon, and the Monkey King. There is no set up to each encounter as the title character Xuan Zang tends to show up out of the blue, do battle, fail, and get saved by a better demon hunter Miss Duan. That's how each fight transpires from start to finish over the course of a 2 hour movie. We never really learn much about the title characters or a handful of minor characters who randomly appear and disappear. The whole movie and the threat of these demons is just glossed over for special effect and battle pieces that get rather boring by the end of the film.Xuan Zang is the lead—a demon hunter who believes in reforming demons rather than killing them, but we never learn why. There are no flashbacks or character development to lead us to understand why he thinks so differently about the monsters. He's a typical Chow innocent, almost exactly like Chow's character in a dozen of his previous movies. He is horrible at what he does until the end when he finally rises to the occasion.Second central character is Miss Duan (the love interest). She appears to help him out against the water demon and then appears out of nowhere when he tries to fight the pig demon. All we know about her is that she isn't an innocent as she kills whoever steps in her path and doesn't know how to flirt or express herself without using her fist. She travels the world with her sister and a couple hired goons that we only see once in a prolonged sequence in the middle of the movie. Like everyone else in this movie we never learn enough about them to care.I understand this is a comedy/action/fantasy movie, but enough character background and development has to be done for us to root for them and sadly, there wasn't. When people start to die at the end—you don't care.The CGI is laughably bad. I'll be honest, during the sequence with the water demon (by far the best part of the whole film) the effects looked great. The water demon looked fantastic, but the pig, the green screen sets, and the over-the-top ending are just so cartoon and obviously fake that it takes away from the film.One of the biggest problems for the film is the forced romance between the central characters. There is no chemistry between them. Miss Duan follows Xuan Zang to each of his encounter with the demons to ensure his safety and when the battle is over tries to get him to confess he loves her, which is something he never does until the ending. She gets rejected, if I remember correctly, 3 or 4 times before (SPOILER WARNING) he finally admits to loving her for 10,000 years as she dies! This romance had about as much heat and passion in it as Twilight. I couldn't believe how flat and forced it was with no payoff.But there are more crimes against this movie which just annoyed me to no end—blatant stealing of items from other Stephen Chow movies. Now part of me believes that Stephen Chow didn't direct this whole movie—in fact, you can see that there are two directors.The Water Demon sequence is about 15 to 20 minutes long and is on a beautifully constructed set—similar to the one found in Kung Fu Hustle. The humor here is excellent, the camera shots, the tension, the drama, everything works perfectly. I was thrilled to be watching one of my favorite Chinese directors hit his mark and exceed. However, after that sequence and a short encounter with Xuan Zang's teacher, Buddha in earthly form, the film falls apart and the ripping off begins. Here are some examples: 1.) The Nursery Rhyme Book: in this film, Xuan Zang uses a book of nursery rhymes in an attempt to bring out the goodness in the demons. Other demon hunters laugh at him and mock him from using it, which later turns out to be a very powerful weapon against the Monkey King. In Kung Fu Hustle it's the same thing—main character buys a book of Kung Fu from a guy, everyone thinks it's a joke, but later on he realizes how to use and becomes a great Kung Fu master.2.) The score from this movie comes from Kung Fu Hustle.3.) Prince Important uses magic swords to fight in the exact same way as the blind music killers from Kung Fu Hustle.4.) (SPOILERS) Buddha kills the Monkey King with the Palm Stephen Chow's character in Kung Fu Hustle used to defeat the villain.All these factors lead me to believe that Stephen Chow directed the first part and was basically helping with the film rather than directing. If I am wrong, then it's a sad day when you see such comedic genius fall so far from grace. If you want to see a hilarious Stephen Chow movie about the Journey to the West see his old movies instead.The last thing I will mention is the endingoh man, what a joke! (SPOILERS) In the end, the three demons join our main character as he travels to the west to spread the word of Buddha—but why would you want to see the continued adventures of a demon who ate a little girl, a demon that had a hotel used to lure travelers so he could eat them, or a Monkey King who ripped a guy's throat out and killed the main characters love?",negative
Journey to the West,"Fortunately, the movie packs Stephen Chow's comedic style, or I would call it contains his soul. There's Chow's usual style of comedy, action, love story, and some meaning behind life. Well, what more is needed in a blockbuster movie? Unfortunately, nothing is perfect. I went into the cinema without any expectation, and I didn't read any reviews so I could enjoy the whole movie as if I was the first to do so. I understand that Chow directed this movie, and even demonstrated to retain the ""feel"" of his usual style. Still, I find the first 15 minutes of the movie to be a little dry in terms of humor. As the protagonist enters the scene it was a bit difficult for me to laugh. However, as the story unfolds, and as the mainstream humor pours in, laughter floods the cinema wave after another. To add, the protagonist's wacky hair style, does resemble Chow in some ways.The CGI is of top quality, I can see the movie spending a lot of money on CGI. Many of the scenes contain a lot of visual detail and picturesque grounds. The music is familiar and lovely, I shall not reveal too much.Show Luo's appearance in this movie was like his usual funny-self in his TV entertainment news. I would appreciate it more if he would have neglected his usual style and adopted a new one. It's not a bad thing, but it's not a good thing too, it lies somewhere on the neutral side. I guess on the good side, his fans will love to see him.Trying my best not to disclose too much. This movie is a prequel to his previous 2 part movie, ""A Chinese Odyssey Part One: Pandora's Box, and A Chinese Odyssey Part Two: Cinderella."" The essence of this movie is how it somehow relates to ""A Chinese Odyssey"" in terms of how life is, in its cycle. The feelings the protagonist experienced in this movie is similar to what his disciple experienced in ""A Chinese Odyssey"". The good news for those who haven't seen ""A Chinese Odyssey"", is that you can watch this movie on its own.Lastly, there are some tear-jerking scenes. My eyes welled up at some parts, but I stayed a man. I would give this a 9.5 out of 10 because of its imperfection, but the scores only allow whole numbers. So.... enjoy the movie.",positive
Bang Bang,"This is just a mindless, senseless and meaningless film. Don't know how can one like this movie.Hrithik stole the Kohinoor diamond and all those 153 minutes he keeps escaping from the cops and co..Katrina has to do very little and she cannot act. A typical crap bollywood flick. There was nothing to rate it above 6 or 7. Some Indian people, actually most have rated it 10, I mean what the hell? Do they even know what a good movie means? The budget of this movie is around 150 crores but all the money are wasted. They have shoot-ed in various places around the globe but fails to impress in the acting and plot departments.I want my 153 minutes back! Don't watch it! Such a crap film.",negative
Bang Bang,"I have got to tell anyone who will listen that this is one of THE best adventure and Action movies in Bollywood I've ever seen.The only word I can think of to describe this movie is BRILLIANT. It's amazing work and everything I had hoped for and more. The entire cast really delivered. You needed more than just action actors or stunt doubles to play all these parts. This movie defines Bollywood development.. and Hrthik is awesome in this movie... + dance scenes also so great music (restaurant scene)You should watch it, better then original!Also listen soundtrack after movie, i can't stop it!",positive
Batman: Gotham by Gaslight,"Batman Gotham by gaslight I believe is based off a comic. I can't remember much of the interview so do bare with me.I am sorry but I am just not impressed with the movie at all. The whole story was predictable over who was behind the murders of those women that got killed by Jack the Ripper. I will give it some credit since the animation is good quality and the voice cast was really good. Especially since it was nice hearing Bruce Greenwood voice Batman again and I am looking forward to hearing him again in season 3 of Young Justice. Well at least we never had weird shippings like Batman and Batgirl/Nightwing and Harley Quinn seriously? God knows what was Timm thinking when he was making those movie. Now this? Even though Justice League Gods and monsters chronicles was messed up and nearly killed the DC Universe at least the movie made up for it (see my reviews). This on the other hand is just student work i mean seriously: Jim Gordon is the ripper?, Tim, Dick and Jason are orphans running the on the streets and are raised by some mugger to steel?, Barbra Gordon is a psychopath?,I could go on and on but I am going to end my review here.",negative
Batman: Gotham by Gaslight,"Decent story; pathetic, ultra-cheap, non-animation! It looks like they had told the basic story line to a bunch of completely talentless 5th-graders and told them to ""take some hard-lead ugly-colored pencils and draw us some pictures of this story.""",positive

[REC] 4: Apocalypse,"I have never really loved mainstream Hollywood horror movies, and REC's first installment is one of my favorites. While the first film (c. 2007) of the franchise is arguably the best, there is a real debate about the third one, which talks altogether about something else. But, in here, the director-actress duo have successfully closed a good franchise by continuing stories from the second and third films.We are now in a quarantined ship where doctors are researching on a serum that will serve as an antidote to the parasite and its bacteria. Our reporter friend, two Military soldiers, doctors, and the ship's crew fret it out in a ""survival of the fittest"" kinda situation as the subject of the research runs amok. As a zombie apocalypse ensues, alas! without the found footage element, but with security surveillance element, we find out that the truth is not what it seemed to be. And there is more to what happened at the end of installment two.Although the film starts pretty slowly, it becomes spot on after thirty or so minutes. Lots of unwanted blood baths and absurd dialogs may keep you from continuing, but if you are brave enough and forgo these horror film requisites, REC 4 will turn out to be real entertainment. The dark setting helps as the franchise probably ends here.BOTTOM LINE: If you have been following the franchise, this will make an amazing watch with friends and family. Happy New Year 2015!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOFore/Violence: Infinity",negative
[REC] 4: Apocalypse,"Looking forward to see REC 4 ones it was over I was left with mixed emotions. The unique story of REC was gone. By now you do know how the zombies or infected do look and move and the surprises seen in part 1 and 2 are gone. It's of course normal that by part 4 you have seen it all before but even as it has a few intense moments it's the use of lighting and the shots that made it hard to sit through.It starts off rather well because we go back to the apartment were Ángela Vidal (Manuela Velasco) was taken by the infested and disappeared at the end of part 1. They do rescue her not without a few attacks by the way. She's been taken to a cargo on the ocean were they are doing experiments on her and the soldiers who has taken her out of the apartment. It's even funny when suddenly an old lady comes across the story who is asking were the honeymoon takes place, a wink to REC 2. But by then the story weakens a bit because once you see the lab you know what is going to happen. When an experiment goes wrong an infected monkey breaks out of it's cage and spreads the disease. But what could have been a surprising reprise turned into an annoying experience. Lights do flash a lot and the camera moves a lot and is zoomed in for most of the time so it's a on and off of seeing what is going on. The reason is rather simple, the surprise of REC couldn't be done again. It even reminded me a lot of Alien (1979) because Angela becomes the hero and walks around in her undershirt a lot so Ripley isn't that far away. There's a bit of explanation what makes the virus and the end is open so it's off to REC 5 I guess. But I hope that the suspense and the creepy look of the infected like in REC is back there. Don't get me wrong. It isn't that bad after all but due the use of zoomed in shaky camera shots it didn't infected me .Gore 2/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",positive
Batman and Harley Quinn,"I paid twenty bucks to see this movie in the cinema. Twenty bucks to watch Harley Quinn farting in the Batmobile and Batman telling Nightwing it ""smells like discipline."" I'm serious. The movie was bad enough before that with Harley complaining about being treated like a sex object only to then have her way with Nightwing tied to her bed, but the fart scene was as much as I could take. Yes, I endured the rest of this in order to review it but nothing could save it by then. Poor writing, too many convenient plot devices and a really lazy ending. Plus a post-credit sequence that went for 3.5 minutes and had zero relevance to the actual plot of the movie! I really hope this isn't the direction the DC animated universe is heading, because if that's the case I'm done with it.",negative
Batman and Harley Quinn,"I don't understand the low rating?Batman and Harley Quinn was fun, sexy, and very entertaining to watch. I really liked Melissa Rauch as Harley Quinn, and I really like it when she tied up Nightwing and seduces him. The story and plot are easy to follow along. Harley working alongside Batman and Nightwing is a great touch, and I wonder if Nightwing and Harley will continue to be friends with benefits as long as she stays on her meds? It seems Batman just doesn't trust or thinks Harley is sane enough to make it a permanent relationship. I don't really know what's going to happen, I'm new to the Batman DVD's and haven't really been interested in them until lately.",positive
Kilo Two Bravo,"I was recommended this by a fellow ex-serviceman as I'm usually pretty weary of this stuff. It is a little bit slow to start. (But then life in the Army can be like that.) Then it go's wrong spectacularly quickly. (Life in the Army can definitely be like that.) If you haven't served in the British forces you might not get this film, at one point I was sat quietly crying when a guy spat out a one liner that had me in creases. I won't go in to the old ""them and us"" bit, comparing British soldiers to American soldiers, suffice to say that these guys are very understated hero's. No hullabaloo, no histrionics just guts and above all a camaraderie that cannot be replicated anywhere else. But don't take my word for it, judge for yourself. Please.",negative
Kilo Two Bravo,"I like war films. Not because I like war, but since it happens I'd like to know more about it. This film isn't like ""Platoon"", ""Hamburger Hill"", ""Saving Private Ryan"" or any other such ""Movies"". This film isn't like a movie at all. It is so real that it sucks you into every moment as though you were actually there. After the character development, I was literally on the edge of my seat, with my elbows on my knees with my hands holding my cheeks. I saw it at home, so thankfully I was able to pause it to make a cocktail; I needed one because it was that serious. Other war films I have seen and liked; they seem like popcorn fodder compared to this one. I was so engrossed in the progression and actually became angry at war itself like I have never felt before. I wasn't aware it was a true story until the end credits and I cried then. I was emotional throughout the film, not even knowing this. It was so real that I talked not only to myself, but to the characters I was watching.Thankfully, there were no ""shaky cameras"" like ""Inglorious Bastards"", making it easy to concentrate on what was really going on. What was going on was disturbing and humbling at the same time. Every scene and every incidence was relevant. I don't even call this film a ""movie"", because it is better than that. I have never given 10/10 to any film and rarely write reviews, but this one is deserving of a 15/10 if that were possible. If you have any reservations about watching this film, cast them aside and view it. Every aspect of what a perfect film would be about is included in this one. It's not a family film or for those who faint easily. It is gripping, extremely graphic, truthful and simply a masterpiece of cinema. It is deserving of the Academy Award for ""Best Picture"", ""Best Director"", ""Best Screenplay"", ""Best Actor"", Best Supporting Actor"", ""Best Cinematography"", ""Best Editing"", ""Best Makeup"", and of all the films I have ever seen, I put this one on the top of my list, and that isn't an easy feat. With my child love of the ""Wizard Of Oz"" and my insatiable lust for ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Wars"", this film has dethroned all of them. This is the best film I have ever seen in my life.",positive
Max,"What can I say about such a great movie? Go see it! Josh Wiggins is amazing he is going to be a big star ""Mark my words"" and Dejon Laquake and Mia Xitali are a breath of fresh air! Max is a movie the whole family will love. The music, writing and the directing of this movie is also superb. This movie brought evokes emotion as you really care about the characters and this dog called Max. I liked the twist that happens, that I'm not going to spoil and there were a few times where I jumped in my seat and there were times I was on the edge of my seat rooting for the dog. If you haven't seen Max please go see it, you will not be dissappionted. In fact you will fall in love just as much as I did.",negative
Max,"Going into view the movie, I had low expectations. I thought it was just going to be another boring kiddie movie. Boy, was I wrong!! This movie is action packed and intense. It kept me on the very edge of my seat the whole duration. There is some serious suspense to say the least. Not only that, but it's a real tear jerker. Good luck getting through this movie without becoming teary eyed at least once. I ended up falling in love with the dog Max and admired his loyalty toward his family. It really portrays how dogs are wonderful creatures at heart and brilliant judges of character. It's funny how one dog can make such a great impact. If you love dogs, warmhearted family stories, and tales of heroism then don't miss out on this one!",positive
The East,"This stands out as one of the most cinematic independent films that i have seen, felt like a real film. Independent films almost always have a great story to tell, as it requires such dedication from the cast and crew to make; therefore wouldn't be made if it did not have something to say. But most independent films seemed to find it except able to feel like and independent film, not saying they suck, it just doesn't feel like you are actually watching a film, and is (rightfully so) normally excused by the audience at film festivals, and in the select theaters it plays at, this film was highly cinematic and overall just told and utterly amazing story. It's the kind of film that keeps you thinking for weeks about the ideas portrayed in the film; and actually makes you want to rethink how you live your own life. All in all a great film to watch, amazing values, a great way to learn about a new life style; and a picture that really just gets you thinking. I'd recommend it for anyone to view.",negative
The East,"Hey, wake up IMDb reviewers. Hiller Brood, the security firm that is half the focus of The East, is based on Booz Allen, the Chicago firm that is the largest private spy company in the world and that supplied Edward Snowden with his felicitous job at the NSA. Business Week's site has a good summary article on their business model.Also: every review I've read seems to think the female lead's terrorist love interest, played by Alexander Skarsgård, is the group's leader, despite the only slightly subtle dig at that expectation the movie provides, when the infiltrator calls him the leader and gets surprised looks, after which the Ellen Page character is shown to exercise the most influence. (Hey, they're anarchists, no leaders, duh!)Don't know why some reviewers think the movie doesn't take a stand on the issue at its core: the morality of retaliation against corporate wrongdoing. The terrorists (and infiltrator) are young, good-looking and thoroughly moral, while their corporate enemies are ugly, brutish and thoroughly unpleasant, tho they have, of course, the law, and all its apparatus, firmly on their side.",positive
Zashchitniki,"Collection of all the movie clichés, plagiarized plot line, mixed with Russian imperialism (somehow claiming former Soviet republics in any stupid way possible). Not good enough to be a joke or a trash...total waste of resources.Do not waste your time on it, not to say - god save you from going to cinema and paying money for this crap.",negative
Zashchitniki,"from the heavy handed introduction / title sequence involving unpleasant manipulation of Humans, I knew I was in for a treat. My viewing pleasure was massively enhanced by the appallingly translated subtitles, (talking about a daughter, saying ""he did this and died"" or something along those lines) The frequent, perplexing ""gazing at another's grief"" scenes with characters that looked as though they had all traces of expression CGI'd from their faces. News bulletins that looked as if the broadcasters didn't really know how serious all this might be. Arsus (the bear) seemed to be suffering some kind of existential crisis going on most of the time, even when he was a bear, and the grinning oaf that seemed to be the bad guy was fantastic, posturing with his hands in the air whilst manipulating his machines. So in all seriousness, one of the best / worst films I have ever experienced in my life of watching Really Bad science fiction films. and believe me this was Really Bad. Great Fun.",positive
Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV,"The film is great, amazing graphics, amazing actor rendering, amazing everything except a decent story for anyone that is not going to play the FFXV game.I would really give it a 10 however they just left it open for the game (hence the video at the end of the credits), quite a few questions unanswered too (for example what were the demons, how were they summoned, where did they come from?). I had no idea what was happening half the time, why were they fighting, why were some characters so important. All I can say about this film is that it is a introduction to the FFXV game, if you don't own a PS4 or an Xbox One are a gamer or have no intention of purchasing FFXV then this will be just a mediocre very nice polished CGI.I have no intention in buying the game and I feel duped, like a marketing ploy. I won't be buying a console and the game just because of a movie.I think by making the movie an introduction to the game they are alienating anyone not playing the games (at least previous movies were stand alones). The only thing I can suggest is to start reading more on Wiki and once the game is out hunt around on Youtube to see all videos from the game to understand the story better. Obviously this is what I will be doing as they left me wanting more. I wish they would make a sequel once the game has been out to tie things together.By all means, watch it, it is well worth it for the animation, amazing, however bear in mind that it is just an introduction to the FFXV game. If you are someone that has played the previous FF installments, loves the FF universe, pre-ordered and is looking forward to the new FFXV game then this is exactly for you and I highly recommend it. For everyone else...",negative
Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV,"I have seen several movies regarding or based on video game, yet none not even close of Kingslaive. I also saw the other two Final Fantasy movies and neither of them is even half good as this one. This isn't a masterpiece overall, has its own flawes, but nonetheless it's a great and solid movie, worth watching and rewatching.
The CGI is spectaculos, so realistic and well-made, carrying you truly into a story, a fantasy. We see new power additions to the word, the eye-catching warp magic forged by the blink dagger of the glaive which is a pretty cool thing to watch.
But above all are the character, many of them very interesting -I really wanted to know even more about each of them- and the story itself. Some said the plot is not coherent enough. I think those people did not paid enough atention, especially at the prologue. Kingsglaive is not just a story about battles and special effects, it's a story about duty, about courage, about sacrificies and responsabilities. You care for those characters and their fates. It tells a good and engaging story, something that movies nowadays completly lacking. It has soul and sentiment. It has a message.
Don't mind the critics and the low-rated reviews. Give it a try, you may be pleasantly surprised.",positive
Shaun the Sheep Movie,"13 February 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester This Aftenoon - Shaun The Sheep. I would just like to point out that I was the only adult there without a child.....or maybe I was the only child without an adult!!!!!! Nick Park and his team have done it again. This was classic Aardman animation, with our old pal Shaun. Bored with his mundane life Shaun and his sheepy friends engineer a way to have a day off but all goes drastically wrong when the farmer ends up in the big city with memory loss. It's up to the animals to save him and what follows is a madcap series of events where nobody questions sheep dressed as humans or any of the antics that occur. Completely without dialogue the story is carried along by the excellent score and gesticulations and a gaggle of bleats, grunts and other indiscriminate noises. As we know animation these days caters for all ages and with various movie references included the adults were definitely laughing at different times to the children. Watching some good old stop motion animation is a very pleasant way to pass the time.",negative
Shaun the Sheep Movie,"I never ever go to the cinema (I rather wait for the Blu-ray to be released and just paying once but yet I went to London from Spain just to see this movie. I didn't wanna wait for it to be released here. Shaun the Sheep is a brilliant TV show so when I found out a movie was being made I was totally thrilled. Even though going from the 7-minute episode to a full length movie was a big step, I was confident in Aardman to made the transition easily. They didn't disappoint. First, let me say that I love stop-motion; it's such an ""intimate"" technique due to the fact that you always have to literally be on top of the character to change it every time he makes the slightest movement. But not only is the technique beautiful, the story doesn't disappoint either. This doesn't feel like a dragged out episode of the show, it feels like a story that goes beyond the usual surroundings of the show while still maintaining how everything works. This movie made me laugh a lot. If there's something that Shaun the Sheep always achieved was the ability to create humor of the most simplest situations. But I also cried a lot. Tears of sadness and happiness. And truthfully, I never expected Shaun the Sheep to reach me so deeply. There's a scene where you can see so much pain in Shaun eyes. And that's just clay! My God, congratulations to whoever did that, it was so moving. And I also had a sweet spot about Slip, the dog that Shaun meets early in the movie and come along for the adventure. She was a new character but she felt like and old member of the gang. I haven't enjoyed a movie so much in a long time. And I haven't felt so many thing with a movie in a long time either. So thank you, Aardman, for giving a fan such a great gift.",positive
Bleach,"I'm a HUGE fan of the Bleach series, so I couldn't help but critique every little thing as I watched. There were a lot of things that this movie did very well: character and set design being the main selling points. Renji and Byakuya both look EXCELLENT, and Chad is just about perfect. It's a shame he didn't get the screen time he needed.And that's where most of my dissatisfaction comes in to play: time. There is so much character development lacking simply because there's not enough time in a single movie to develop everything the way it needs to. For crying out loud, Orihime comes across as a nobody with an unjustifiable crush.. Talk about disappointing.Ichigo himself is, overall, a success. They did a good job portraying his desire to protect people and his overall negative attitude. So in short, his personality was well-done! What I WANTED to see from him, though, was that overwhelming feeling of power. The anime does an excellent job demonstrating the weight of someone's reiatsu (aka spirit pressure), but that concept is practically nonexistent here. Which means all of the fights (though amazingly choreographed with some clever editing to try matching the speed of the anime) lack some of the awe and wonder that sets Shinigami apart from mortals.Oh, and minor spoiler alert for fans of the anime... the scene with the Menos Grande were cut entirely, as was Getsuga Tenshou. Let that sink in for a moment.So why watch this at all? Because most of the story is incredibly accurate - until you get to the last half hour. The fights are pretty epic. And altogether, you can visualize the anime quite clearly as you're watching, giving you a wonderful sense of nostalgia.",negative
Bleach,"Go see it. There is a reason people are raving about it as the first decently done adaptation of an anime. It's not perfect, but it is legitimately great and keeps the spirit and feel of the series. Most of the negative reviews of this I've seen so far seem to be coming from people who either don't know the series very well (a hazard with professional reviewers, since they cover so many things), don't understand Japanese cinema (some acting techniques/nuances are different between East and West), or who are just determined to hate it because everything doesn't look 100% identical to the manga (I've seen far worse anime to live-action with far bigger budgets, believe me). This movie condenses the entire half of the first season of the anime (books 1-6), and leaves room for a sequel without leaving hanging threads in the event one never happens.Like many other fans, I was very, VERY skeptical of this movie when it first was announced. I was honestly that person going, ""Oh god, another live action movie of an anime. Can't wait to see how cheesy and bad this ends up.""I'm a convert. You win, Mr. Sato. Take my left kidney and sell it, and whatever else you need to fund the next movie in your trilogy. I've seen it three times now (I live in Japan) and am going again tomorrow. I'm still not bored watching it. It's the sort of movie that fans of the series will keep finding new gems tucked away with each rewatch. If you're not intimately familiar with the manga or anime however, don't sweat it - this is very accessible to newcomers.Characters - 9/10 There are some physical differences (Urahara is older, Masaki's hair isn't red, etc.), but the acting is solid and the character dynamics/relationships are exactly the way they are in the manga. Even if the character looked a bit different, I believed the actors as the characters. Ichigo and Rukia may not have the exact same hair or face as you'd expect, but they absolutely nailed the characters - Ichigo's determination and grit, Rukia's spunky sarcasm, it's all really great.Costumes - 8/10 There was some saving of the budget here for fight scenes - you won't see exact replicas of captain's haoris or the tabi with straw sandals. Rather, the film tries to make things more realistic (i.e. a more natural orange for Ichigo's hair, smaller size hairpins for Orihime, etc.) It looks less like the wacky cosplay of the Rock Musical for Bleach and more like a legit world people actually live in.Music - 10/10 Invokes the anime without copying it, and Alexandros has two kickass songs that make Bleach feel fresh and edgy and hip with a touch of Japan's ancient history and the otherwordliness of the Soul Society.Plot - 9/10 Whenever possible, the film follows the manga almost exactly. For the purposes of sticking 6 manga volumes into one movie, some minor characters (Jinta, Mizuiro, Ururu, etc.) are not introduced, and some events get condensed (i.e. Uryu's hollow bait kicks off the Hexapodus fight that makes Ichigo take being a shinigami seriously, not a Menos Grande). Overall, the story is still very close to the way the manga told it, just condensed.Props - 8/10 Soul Pagers get replaced with something more like a glowing, teardrop shaped stone that looks more otherwordly (let's be honest, when Bleach debuted flip phones were cool, now they're a bit ancient), the zanpakuto are very accurate (yes, even Ichigo's, ignore the reviewers claiming he gets a different sword - the iconic one he's constantly shown with was not the first one he ended up with, and that first sword is what's used here). Rukia's glove and many other things are exactly like the manga.Set - 9/10 Rather than waste the tiny budget this film had in exactly reproducing floorplans and sets (a mere 3.5 million, which is nothing in terms of filmmaking on this level), things are made to feel similar. Ichigo's room is not laid out exactly the same as the manga/anime, but it still has a bed, desk, closet for Rukia to hide in, etc. and feels like Ichigo's room. Same with the Kurosaki household - it feels convincing, if not exactly the same as the manga showed it.Fights: 9.5/10 There are so many good moments here I can't list them all. Is there some visible wire-fu jumping at points? Yes. Does it ruin the action? No, it's no worse than some of the jumps Captain America made in a few films (you know, where they land far too lightly and stiffly to be actually ""falling/landing""?) The Hollows look less cartoonishly simple and more menacing, yet they still have the same mechanics (Cero, claws, medusa-like fur). At one point Ichigo's sword gets stuck in the ground and Renji RUNS UP THE BLADE EDGE and attacks. The swordplay is fantastic.Seriously, give it a chance. There is enough here to please all but the hardcore sticklers (who were never really going to like anything made on less than a Marvel Avengers budget). I was pleasantly surprised, and the movie feels enough like falling in love with the series all over again that I keep going back. I've never dropped $60 and counting on tickets for one movie, especially not an anime adaptation. GO SEE IT!",positive
Queen,"I had high expectation from the movie as it was rated 9 on IMDb. Everybody praising the movie and I disliked the movie. I watched the movie twice just to make sure that I am not missing something. The story was straight forward and little different from others. That was the only thing I found good about Queen. I find that like many other bollywood movies, the director doesn't believe in logic. All the technicalities have gone for a toss. It includes all known jokes. I really do not understand Why people have liked the movie. The movie tries to show empowerment of a girl and how do they show it by simply lowering the standard to start with. A Delhi girl who is scared to cross streets in Paris ( was she not crossing much crowded streets in Delhi? ) , Speaks continuously in Hindi. Rukhrsar(Roxette) comes to Amsterdam to study because they had no money(BOLLYWOOD LOGIC). Every scene follows some cliché. Gol gappe scene, the web cam scene, the sex toys shop scene etc were too predictable. For me there was nothing extra-ordinary in movie.",negative
Queen,"QUEEN is directed by Vikas Bahl, starring Kangana Ranaut, in the lead role, along with Rajkummar Rao and Lisa Haydon.The film revolves around Rani (Kangana Ranaut), an innocent Punjabi girl, who gets dumped one day before her wedding day. She gets an idea to go on her honeymoon all by herself, and that very trip shows her road to self-empowerment while going through several comical situations...The trailer of Queen didn't quite attract much attention, therefore, the film was extremely underrated by several critics, including me. However, the songs did grab a portion of my attention, so I was curious to know whether I was looking at Queen from a wrong angle. The film, itself, faced fierce competition from Madhuri-Juhi starrer, Gulaab Gang and the much-awaited Total Siyapaa. However, the reviews came in for the three films, and I was shocked to see so much praise for Queen. So I decided to go with the critics and chose Queen over Total Siyapaa that weekend. And I think its safe for me to say that it is one of the best decisions I've made in my life (and it might be yours too).Queen starts off in the most mainstream desi way possible. The Big Fat Indian Wedding with relatives at every nook and corner and dance to Punjabi tunes is galore. The calling off of the wedding takes place and you feel yourself going through the very same events as Rani. This is due to pure direction and acting. However, the film takes a VERY sharp turn when she leaves for her honeymoon. Rani meets new friends, goes through life how a woman should, and I think it was a smart move on the director to release it on Women's Day, because at the end of the film, the message is pretty clear. However, I shall not go on further about the plot, because after she leaves India, its all just fun.The acting is just top-notch. Kangana Ranaut, in all honesty, carries the film on her shoulders throughout the 2h30m run time. She portrays her character with such finesse that she deserves awards and utter praise for it. Rajkummar Rao played a great job as well and the rest of the foreign actors were just delightful and splendid to see.The songs are great as well. Amit Trivedi also deserves applause for the great music as well as background score. Every single song captures a theme of the film and just blends perfectly with the several scenes in the film. It helps you feel like Rani while she goes through her journey. 'London Thumakada' captures the Indian Wedding Theme, while 'O Gujariya' is just great to listen to. A special mention about the remake of 'Hungama Ho Gaya' which is just complete fun to listen to.In conclusion, QUEEN is possibly one of the best films of the year.

Embrace of the Serpent,"Interesting look at the lifestyle of the Amazon people in the vanishing jungle where a shaman deals with two diverse characters , being first Colombian film nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film . The amazing story of the relationship between Karamakate (Nilbio Torres -Young Karamakate-, Antonio Bolívar -Old Karamakate- and all the natives of the film are natural actors) and two scientists who seek a magic plant , Theo (Jan Bijvoet) and Evan (Brionne Davis) . As decades apart , an Amazonian shaman and last survivor of his people , and two scientists who work together over the course of 40 years to search the Amazon for a sacred healing flower . It's based on two true stories, linked together by one remarkable man and , perhaps, the most famous, celebrated river in the world, the Amazon . And the man is Karamakate, the last shaman of his jungle tribe . We first meet him in 1940 , deep into his sixties as played by Antonio Bolivar, when he encounters a man foreign to his home, an American scientist Richard Evans Schultes (Brionne Davis) . The rain forest of the Amazon are disappearing at the rate of 5000 acres day . Four million Indians once lives there , nowadays 120.000 remain .Embrace Of The Serpent is one such cinematic experience which brought a deserved Academy Award Nomination . Ecological thriller that has in highlighting the destruction of the South American rain woods by the rubbers ; being based upon a real story , on diaries by scientists Theodor Koch-Grunberg and Richard Evan Schultes , both of whom delve into the Amazonian rainforest in search of a rare plant with medicinal and hallucinatory qualities, with the assistance of a local shaman on opposite ends of his own life journey . An ecological adventure with mystical touches that was ahead of its time in denounce about forest destruction , including some disconcerting scenes , as the frames where a man is praised to be the Messiah is based on an actual event . Embrace of the Serpent attempts to frame the destruction of the rain forest's ecology and peoples as a slow-motion tragedy on scales both personal and cultural , but it is more intriguing in its ambitions, which frustrate it, than in it successes, which are limited . This exciting film contains thrills , emotion , adventure and marvelous scenes from deep rainy forest that generate a lot of surprises and illusion . This film has got some images ""stuck in their head"" including several sequences can stay in your brain for a long, long while . Glamorous and lush cinematography by David Gallego who photographs wonderfully the Amazon jungle , obviously filmed under difficult conditions on location . Shot in black-and-white, which is at once visually distinctive but also rather flattening . Evocative musical score by Nascuy Linares and the music Evan plays on the gramophone is Haydn's ""The Creation"". This engrossing and enjoyable film with interesting screenplay by Ciro Guerra and Jacques Toulemonde Vidal was well directed by Ciro Guerra . He's a good professional filmmaking giving various Colombian successes such as Los Viajes Del Viento (2009) and La Sombra Del Caminante (2004) . Rating ""Embrace of the Serpent"" : Better than average . Wholesome watching .",negative
Embrace of the Serpent,"......................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL It isn't much of a leap to venture that the vast majority of IMDb Users have never seen a Colombian Film. If there is a single word in the above Title that grabs you, rest assured, you must ""EMBRACE"" this Oscar-nominated gem by placing it at the top of your ""Must See"" List! Colombian Director Ciro Guerra (Los Viajes del Viento/read my Review) has taken an Amazonian Shaman's reality-based Dream and crafted it into a visionary cinematic hallucination for the ages! The operative term here is ""Culture-Clash"". Two delicately intertwined story lines, both inspired by travel journals authored three decades apart by two Amazonian explorers; German scientist Theodor Koch-Grunberg (Jan Bijvoet, ""Borgman""), in 1909, and by American amateur botanist Richard Evans Schultes (Brionne Davis, ""Avenged""), thirty years later. EMBRACE opens a gritty and convincingly realistic window into the Colombian Amazon Region of the early 20th Century. Guerra gets up close and personal with some of the persistent cultural atrocities perpetrated on indigenous peoples in the Amazon region of Colombia, without dwelling inordinately on them. As if the three plus centuries of Spanish Colonial Rule had not provided enough genocide and torture!For those of you addicted to ""Fast and Furious"" pacing in movies, undoubtedly, will find EMBRACE a bit ""Tedious and Slow"", but I would say, ""Deliberate and True to Life"". One can, at best, barely imagine the laid- back life rhythms in remote regions of the Amazon a century ago! The intentional ever-so-slightly grainy Black & White cinematography imbues EMBRACE with an authentic 1930's look and feel. Of course, there have been numerous critiques of thusly having deprived us of the myriad of Amazon shades of greenBut EMBRACE is not a Travel Promo and I applaud Ciro Guerra's Black & White decision! Here is a comment/comparison you probably might not see anywhere else: Although Director Ciro Guerra was born in 1981, I can't help but think that, as a kid, he saw and was influenced by Stanley Kubrick's 1968, ""2001"" (My Favorite Movie)! There were, in my opinion, a number of interesting parallels, confirmation of which I will leave up to you! Shaman Karamakate, the last survivor of his tribe (Nibio Torres-young/Antonio Bolivar-old) who has been chewed up and spit out as a lifelong victim of culture clash, and, as a result, defines himself as ""chullachaqui"", a walking empty shell zombie of a man.EMBRACE is light years from being a feel-good movie, yet, there is a ""spirituality and focus which can help you transcend even a worst- case scenario of mistreatment and misfortune in life"", that is transformational and which provides ground swelling inspiration! This unique film would probably appeal to those who crave unusual true stories, those of you who enjoy Drama focused on a Clash of Cultures, and movies set in exotic locations! 10*.....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!",positive
Knights of Badassdom,"This was one of the biggest let downs of recent memory. After reading all of the positive reviews, and seeing the incredibly high rating, I really thought I would be in for a treat. The movie wasn't funny, except for a few mild smiles here and there. The special effects, especially towards the end, were atrocious. And the characters were wooden with nothing brought to the screen. And the main premise for the demon was a cringe worthy rip off of the Necronomicon from Evil Dead. The movie has a incredible cast with Peter Dinklage, Summer Glau, Ryan Kwanten, and Steve Zahn. But unfortunately they totally failed to use almost any of their characters to their full (or any) potential. Ryan Kwanten was the only one who was even half way interesting. There were countless times that they could have made something humorous, or even hysterical, but instead it fell totally flat and was just bland. (Where was them humor after the games began and they set it up so obviously for Dinklage?!) I can understand fans of larping enjoying this film, as that unique aspect was the only half way saving grace of this snore-fest. But I can't imagine anyone else could even find it more than mildly entertaining. 3/10 stars and that's being generous.",negative
Knights of Badassdom,"I was extremely lucky to attend the world premiere! The screening was held at the ""Icon"" festival (sort of the Israeli version of comic-con) in Tel-Aviv, Israel. The screening began at midnight on the night of Sep. 24-25 2013. The movie was introduced by one of the producers. She got on stage, said a few words about the film and then dropped the bomb on all of us - This was the world premiere! The theater ERUPTED! Clapping and hooting for a good 2 minutes before she could keep on talking.What can I say? It was a theater packed with geeks and everyone went wild! the film is fantastic! The cast is brilliant and I laughed out loud at least 20 times (Even though on this page it doesn't say that the movie is actually a comedy - it totally is!). People were even clapping and cheering at many key moments. The feeling in the room was electric. We don't know which cut we got to see though, but it didn't feel too long - just right, in fact. Peter Dinklage is wonderful as usual and Summer Glau's performance - she was was fantastic. She is every geek's wet dream of course.. But she really delivered the whole ""I'm not really into this but I'm playing along with it"" role. She looked amazing in her costume! Her on screen chemistry with the other characters was excellent. She is definitely one of the underrated actresses out there.The film itself has some great plot twists and even though it had a very low budget - it manages to escape the feel of a B-movie. It even had some pretty good CGI animation. At the end everyone was clapping and as I walked out of the theater, feeling giddy - EVERYONE was smiling, laughing, reminiscing and all in all I didn't hear a single person saying anything negative about it. The only reason this film gets a 9 is because a 10 is reserved for maybe 5- 10 movies in my life. If you are a geek, were a geek, or simply have a little bit of geekyness in you - don't hesitate when it is released - it's worth every penny! Go with friends who appreciate this kind of stuff. I was never much of a role-playing fan and still felt completely connected to this film. Well done!!",positive
The 100 Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared,"I read this novel in the middle of 2014, and was delighted with the sly humour. When the movie came out - quite quickly I thought - I was a little wary of it, having seen so many good books really wrecked by the film making industry. However, I have to say that if you enjoyed the book (and you can cope with a little necessary pruning) you should enjoy the movie. It's very well done, it's very funny and it captures the essence of the book perfectly. The characters were well drawn and the flashbacks were condensed so that the story did not falter or fail but blended together sensibly. A good film for those with a perverse sense of humour. Must watch more Swedish films.",negative
The 100 Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared,"An unexpectedly great movie. I wasn't anticipating much from this Swedish independent, but was laughing all the way through. Fast paced and written with wry deadpan humor.The main character displays similar characteristics to Peter Sellers' Chauncey, in 'Being There'. Its also somewhat reminiscent of Arthur Penn's 70's classic 'Little Big Man' starring Dustin Hoffman in terms of the plot layout.Whether these were intentional homages to personal favorites of mine is not clear, but they worked magnificently. Serious belly laughs as dry humor is dropped effortlessly into every scene. It is such a refreshing change from all those polished Hollywood set pieces which have decreasingly appealing sequels.

Singularity,"This film is so bad I can't even be bothered stringing how much I hate this film into cogent sentences.So, 97 years after the bots take over you're telling me that the windows on the shops are crystal clean? You're telling me that despite no new clothes being manufactured the human characters look like they've just got a whole new wardrobe from GAP? That nearly 100 years of neglect has seen no collapsed roofs, no weeds growing from gutters, and fields that look like they've been fallow for a couple of years? That street signs, railings, window shutters, metal roll shutters have absolutely no signs of rust? That despite the bot driven apocalypse, the main female lead still has time to obviously dye her hair? In the scenes running through forests, they follow well worn and undergrowth free paths.... worn and maintained by whom exactly? Bots? In one of the opening scenes, a shop is engulfed in ivy inside yet in one of the later scenes, a house described as 'really old' has perfectly white whitewashed walls, and inside looks pristine - photographs aren't faded, glass cabinets haven't a speck of dust on them... in fact there is no dust, not even a cob web! And given that the house hasn't been heated for 97 years, it's amazing that there is no damp whatsoever. 97 year old Polaroid film works and, it must be energizer, because the batteries are still fresh. Despite being out in the wilds for days on end the male lead is always perfectly cleanly shaven. Even when he is woken from sleep he has been mysteriously shaved - then again he is a robot - a fact that the writers are at pains to have us aware of from the outset with the laboured 'no food for me' scene - funny then that when the girl falls asleep on his chest she doesn't notice that he doesn't need to breathe (we presume) And then, when they meet some nasty humans, they are all covered in stubble, dirt and worn clothes - oh my, so original.The male lead gets tied up in a brand spanking new rope. I mean, this thing clearly was just bought from a shop on the day... and the rope magically moves from one scene to the next... did they take lunch in the middle of shooting the 'tied up in brand new rope' scenes? Maybe they should have...The male lead is only capable of two expressions - eyes normal and eyes bursting out of his head. There is nothing in between and the rest of his face is entirely pointless. Lucky for him that the dialogue doesn't require much else. Actually, I'm not giving him credit... he can do a variation on these two expressions above including with mouth open and with mouth shut.The female lead should take urgent note that crying involves water coming from the eyes. You can't snivel and gasp for air, and then expect to look authentic with a perfectly dry face. Special effects are dire - in the opening scenes burning buildings look like someone went mad with the Photoshop clone tool. Explosions don't cast any light on objects that are close by and clouds of dense smoke don't cast any shadows and dissipate in moments leaving no trace. Enormous bots appear to defy the laws of physics and move through dense forestry without causing a single tree to move. 'Whats in your chest' scene - great work on the 97 year old straw bales that look to have been made in the last week... and the plentiful fresh straw on the ground in the barn... just lazy... Lighting.... I mean really.... what is happening with the lighting? In a dark and dingy forest, and it looks like two blazing follow spots behind the cameras.... just cheap and nasty.The characters are so poorly developed that their behaviour is schizophrenic at best.Continuity is a joke - in the opening scenes we see buildings burnt to to the ground, yet in later scenes, and I mean 97 years later scenes, they are visible in the background, with lights on inside. Really, 97 years after the rise of the bots, they are still using lights? Who is changing the bulbs? Bot janitor? Who even makes the bulbs?The bots themselves. If you're looking for humans, perhaps IR might be better than visible light to detect them? I think it's utterly lazy that the main feature of the film, that drives the whole storyline, the bots, are so poor.After leaving the 'facility' (you just know that's what they call it), they walk through a field of corn ready to be harvested. I'm feeling like a stuck record here...John Cusack must have been desperate for the cash.",negative
Singularity,"No logic, no sense, no feelings, no action. The sounds are surprisingly bad, conversations are full of cliché. Neither director nor actors should be proud of this work. I'm sure it could be done much better with minor changes to scenario and at least some effort!

The Young and Prodigious T.S.

Turbo Kid,"Let's make a movie about the future, but set it in the past and make it look like it was set even further in the past. That could've been the pitch for ""Turbo Kid"" (NR, 1:33) – and that's just one of many interesting and unusual things that there are to learn about this film even before discussing what it's about. For one thing, it's a co-production of Canada and New Zealand. Since it's technically a foreign film, it has no MPAA rating (but if it did, it would surely be rated ""R""). The movie has three directors, François Simard, Anouk Whissell and Yoann-Karl Whissell, all three of which also share credit for the screenplay, and all appear in the movie in small roles. What's more, the cinematographer, Jean-Philippe Bernier, is also one of the two people who did the film's score, which is a highly unusual combination of jobs. Now, let's get back to that highly unusual pitch summary in the first sentence of this paragraph.""Turbo Kid"" is a post-apocalyptic action movie set in the ""future"" year of 1997. That actually makes sense when you know that the film intentionally looks and sounds like it was made in the early 1980s. Stating it another way, this movie is ""retro futuristic"". It's a lot like many of the movies made in the late 70s and early 80s. In fact, the year picked for the story's setting, 1997, is the same year in which 1981's classic dystopian action thriller ""Escape from New York"" takes place. And that's not the only connection between other movies of this film's sub-genre. There are passing verbal references and visuals that are subtle shout-outs to movies like ""Soylent Green"" and ""The Terminator"". What's not so subtle is the strong and obvious influence of another post-apocalyptic film series from the 1980s (rebooted in 2015) on the plot, setting and costumes in this movie. As ""Wired"" magazine said, it's ""'Mad Max' on a BMX"".Munro Chambers plays a character simply called ""The Kid"", an orphaned teen just trying to survive in a land laid waste by something (?) which led to the end of civilized society. The Kid scavenges items that he can ""sell"" to his world's version of a pawn broker (Romano Ozari) for that most precious of commodities – water. The water that exists is under the control of a sadistic general called Zeus (Michael Ironside). As he brags to his ""minions"" (NOT the cute kind), he not only provides their liquid sustenance, but their entertainment as well. He sponsors regular violent and bloody gladiatorial-like contests between his ""henchmen"" (better word) and those unfortunate enough to have double-crossed Zeus or just crossed his path.When he's not scavenging, The Kid is obsessing over his favorite superhero, someone called ""Turbo Rider"". The Kid has various Turbo Rider memorabilia in his house and then gets a hold of an old Turbo Rider comic book, which he seems to value almost as much as staying hydrated. As he's sitting in an old playground reading his comic book aloud to himself, he's approached by a girl named Apple (played by Canadian actress Laurence Leboeuf) who wants to be friends. She's impossibly chipper (either gratingly or adorably, depending on your point of view) and she may or may not be a cold-blooded killer. But she insists on hanging out with The Kid, and, well, friends are hard to come by in this terrible future-past (or is it past-future?), so he lets her tag along as he scavenges.As dangerous as this time and place is, you have to be tough to survive. The Kid teaches Apple his rules for survival and soon the two of them meet someone even tougher than The Kid – a cowboy type named Frederic (Aaron Jeffery) who's an arm-wrestling champion and the closest thing that the few decent people left alive have to a protector. That is, until The Kid becomes Turbo Kid. He finds a costume that makes him look and feel like his hero, Turbo Man. The costume doesn't help him fly or anything, but it does have a pretty serious weapon built into one of the arms. The Kid becomes Turbo Kid just in the nick of time. For different reasons, Apple and Frederic both run afoul of Zeus and they need some serious turbo-charged rescuing! But even if Turbo Kid can free his only two friends from the clutches of Zeus, he'd likely be pretty ticked off and would probably want to hunt them down and, you know, kill them all.It's kind of a tough thing to judge this movie. On the one hand, it is very effective at evoking the feeling of cheesy early-80s future schlock. On the other hand, the violence (albeit comic violence) can be a bit excessive – unless you find dismemberment and gallons of fake blood shooting everywhere to be amusing. Still, the graphic destruction of so many human bodies notwithstanding, this movie deserves credit for being very different from any other 2015 release and it is more entertaining than not. All this comes out to a mild recommendation – with a strong warning. Considering all the blood and guts, a kids' movie this is not, but adults (especially those who like the cheesier movies of the 70s and 80s, and enjoy a good splatter flick) may find seeing ""Turbo Kid"" to be a blast. This B-movie gets a ""B"".",negative
Turbo Kid,"If your primary movie-going experience is watching Hollywood blockbusters with vin diesel, this may not be your cup of tea, but for everyone else, this film destroys it.This film is pure gold, 80's indulgent, brain melting gore, a love story, and even somewhat artistic at times.I won't drone on, but this film i destined to be a staple in horror/art house/comedy cinema.It is fast-paced, adorable, hilarious, brutal, and has a charm that only filmmakers in love with their genres can produce.

Tales of Halloween,"I like a good, strange movie occasionally, but this one made little sense most of the time.I won't comment on the acting or effects, there are enough reviews that I have seen regarding those. And as a fan of the classic Universal monster, old Vincent Prince, Three Stooges and Abbott and Costello monster movies, I knkw that seldom does acting or effects determine my enjoyment of a spooky-season movie. Cohesive storytelling on the other hand, that is important. I can forgive a multitude of sins if the story makes sense.Tales of Halloween is described as ""the best horror anthology since Trick'r Treat"". But where Trick'r Treat's connectivity was integrated into each story, (characters appearing in the background, Sam being present, past events influencing more than one story), this rancid pile of pumpkin gut's connections are tenuous at best. The only real connection is the radio DJ narrative and a couple times you do catch a glimpse of characters from other stories. Few of the stories make any sort of sense if any at all, and those that do have the potential to make decent spooky story, Trick and Grim Grinning Ghost for example, are so short they might as well have been left out altogether.When you go back and read the blurb, these are supposed to be some of the top directors in horror. One would think, that an anthology created by top directors in a genre, would be more cohesive and fleshed out, but it feels more like they each just phoned it in.If anything, this mess mocks Halloween in general, and not in a fun satirical way. It's more like a school yard bully vs the nerdy, Halloween-loving kid.I would have preferred a return of Sam with new tales or even a return of The Crypt-keeper from the 90s.For my Halloween entertainment I'll stick to Trick'r Treat and Tales from the Crypt.",negative

The Last: Naruto the Movie,"horrible movie. road to ninja was popular because it gave time to all characters, and we got a sense of team 7 again (somewhat). the manga was originally about team 7, this movie just took that away. i like naruto and hinata together, really but they should have given the other couples some screen time too instead of leaving them hanging. i mean, even ten minutes each ? sasuke and sakura at least deserved some screen time, they're the main characters aside naruto, and the fans die to see team 7 moments again in combat since we haven't had those animated since narutos first season. ALSO they really should have given us some team 7 moments since this was the last movie we would get to see those. everyone loved the last moments of team 7 in the manga, that's what people like. TEAM 7. not naruto and hinata love throughout. they could have taken it side by side... naruto, hinata, sasuke and sakura in combat. that would have been epic, and would have addressed all the fans out there.

It shows how they have grown, changed and matured, stirring at the heart strings of the many Naruto fans that have watched it from start to finish.

Max Steel,"One of the worst super hero movie of 2016. Extremely slow to tell a story, no action (except for the last few mins of the movie), too many annoying flash back. Seem like the director wasn't sure if he wants to make a sci-fi movie, chic flix, or comedy.. it turns out to be a big mess that drag on and on. People walking out in the middle of the movie, if it wasn't for my 11 year old, I would have done the same.. After the movie, my 11 year old even comment how bad the movie was! Here's an example of how slow the movie was.. the first min. of the movie, it also indicate Max has super power, it took about 30 mins of the movie to finally confirm his super power. Then another 40 mins of the movie to talk about nothing much with flash back.. and finally 5 mins of action (fight scene) to beat the bad guy. When you think it's all over.. they spend another 15 mins to put some unnecessary romance and filler to make the movie 92mins long, so that you don't think the movie is being too short.",negative
Max Steel,"Well lets take it one step at a time. 1) the movie starts well with a mystery going on around our main character and a good enough introduction of the rest of the characters. 2) the plot is good but it doesn't fit only to one movie so i hope for another one. 3) the end, well i am not gonna spoil this but the movie prepares the audience for the end (that makes the movie predictable -ish) but who doesn't like to say ""i knew it"". I liked max and defensively loved steel, i hope there was more about the background of steel and max but i put my faith on the next movie if there is going to be any. It's a movie decent enough to go on a sequel. So i am giving it a 10 because for the kind of movie it is it's very good.",positive
Early Man,"My family and I have been long-time fans of Aardman productions - Wallace and Gromit, Chicken Run, Pirates!, etc. Aardman Studios produces some of the very best stop-motion animation around, but ""Early Man"" was a clear miss. How do I know? Here's how...1) Within the first 10 minutes my wife and sister-in-law couldn't take any more and left the theater, they jumped ship to watch a different movie instead.
2) The best thing my college-aged son and daughter had to say about the movie as we were walking out was that ""at least we got some popcorn out of the deal."" BTW, they both grew up with and love Wallace and Gromit, and Aardman. 
3) The traditionally inventive, fresh feel of Aardman projects didn't happen, this project was stale and trite. The story development was weak and character development was even weaker. 
4) The entire story line was entirely predictable, there were no surprises at all. 
5) The charm of earlier Aardman projects was that they worked equally well for adults and children...not so this film. The few jokes that were in ""Early Man"" would go right over the heads of children and they were largely not that funny for adults. I had maybe one genuine laugh the entire movie. I do have to say that the idea of a championship soccer match between two groups thinly veiled as Brits and French was noteworthy. 
6) What's the film like? My daughter probably summed it up best, ""Chicken Run"" in reverse, but neither memorable nor funny. Animation quality = 10
Story line and character development = 2
Humor = 3
Fun = 2
Disappointment = 9It breaks my heart to rate this movie this low, but there's no way to avoid it.",negative

Next Gen,"First off. The good. Robots are pretty awesome. Some silly robots like the noodle bots and the toothbrush bot but generally they are cool. Especially the main robot. They are well incorporated into a futuristic background that doesn't seem too far off. However. The major let down is the highly unlikeable lead. She is a terrible character with nothing but rottenness in her personality. She is a bully, and unkind. And she justifies that because ""oh her father left when she was younger"". So it is just acceptable that she acts up, hurts others, blames all her misfortunes on everyone else, play guilt mind games. She never learns from her mistakes instead takes it out on everyone else around her. She is not even a little self aware nor does she accepts any responsibility for her own actions. She does not have any redeemable quality. As you watch the movie, instead of making you feel sympathetic to her and engage in her adventure, I find that I am filled with so much hate for her that I actually want to see her fail. I want her to be punished, and that does not make a good story if it makes the viewers hate the lead and want to see her fail!

Some reviews below were rated poorly based on the main character Mai being an angry brat but that IS her character and if she made you feel that way then her job was complete. Her actions were intended to upset you and make you disagree with them so great job with that! Those that said the film is too violent are just being overly sensitive. Look at all the kids films/shows out there that are just as violent, if not more - Power Rangers, DragonBallZ,Tom & Jerry, TMNT, The Lion King, etc - Stop being so sensitive people. I thought Momo the dog was the highlight of the show. The beeping was hilarious and we don't really know what is being said, we're just assuming it was cussing but it really added a lot of humor to the film.I really liked how the film depicted humans as being so dependent and addicted to the robots, much like how we are so addicted to our phones and other technology now. The animation was amazing, kudos to Tangent studios for a great job! Overall the film is fantastic for both kids and adults.",positive
Tracks,"I haven't read the book so my movie watching wasn't tainted or supported by that memory. It could have been a really good movie but it was let down by a number of things that I found so irritating, while I watched it, that they drove me crazy! If I hadn't paid money for St George Open Air, I would have left. It is a terrible movie and I felt embarrassed being Australian if this were ever promoted to foreigners. The acting of the main character is horrible. She has the same two expressions throughout the entire movie. Pouty and more pouty. - Cinematography: there is raving about this in other reviews? Jeez, you know what you see? Camels feet then a wide fly in shot to, guess what? More camels feet. Rinse and repeat for the duration. Over and over and over. Camels feet - sky - camels feet - sky ... YAWN. Like a children's show. - At one point she loses her compass and follows the camel tracks backwards to the compass, but then ... you guessed it, she can't find her way back the camels and gets lost. What the? Next, the camels wander off but now she can't find them. Suddenly she can't see camel tracks or what? Who knows. You are left to guess at what might cause the next pouty face. Poor story telling. - Appears to be a blue screen of Uluru. - The movie, in general, totally lacked the colour and depth of the amazing desert and plant life that exists out there. It was clearly filmed on a very low budget in a very small area. It does not showcase the country. Anyone that says it showcases the outback, needs to actually go there themselves and not armchair review. - Not a traveloge, more like pictures from going round and round a large basin. - Narration would have helped the incessantly annoying pouty look.As for what the book may contain, this movie did not make me want to read it. The character conveyed in the movie was not pleasant or likable and there's no way I'd want to relive anything resembling this experience ever again. Tragically disappointing for all concerned. I gave it 3 for trying something different.",negative
Tracks,"After reading the book ""Tracks"", I found it difficult to imagine anyone being able to transfer it properly to cinema. Well, it took them years to do it, but thankfully they've achieved what seemed almost impossible. I saw ""Tracks"" yesterday and I found it truly moving. It's a beautiful film - not just in its transporting cinematography and landscapes, but beautiful for its truthfulness, its honesty. ""Tracks"" is both sublimely poetic and ruggedly authentic - it's emotionally raw. I didn't find one false note in the movie - no melodrama or stereotype characters that you see in most Hollywood films. Mia Wasikowska's performance demonstrates that old line from Keats, ""Beauty is truth, truth beauty"" - it's a great performance - the epitome of soulful. The journey is as much her character's internal coming to terms with herself and the world, as it is the external journey, but nothing is spoon-fed to the audience. The film is psychological and spiritual and the landscapes and the actions reflect the central character's shedding of burdens and confronting herself in a naked environment - it's universal, but profoundly personal. One reviewer described it as ""achingly beautiful"", having now seen ""Tracks"", I feel that's an apt description. I think director John Curran and everyone involved in making the film has pulled off an extremely challenging project and have created something of lasting value. Congratulations.",positive
A-X-L,"Okay I did enjoy A-X-L romping around the desert with miles on his dirt bike, flying through the air as they bonded. A kid and his billion dollar super dog.With that out of the way, at about 40 minutes into the movie I realized two things. This militarized billion dollar dog weapon, soooo scary looking with super growling 'teeth' was as dangerous as a kitten. Second was the scene where super dog faces off with the evil 18 year old. Does it matter what weapon the 18 year old has? After all he's facing a billion dollar 'weapon of war', right? Suffice to say A-X-L is no match for a teenager. Later, when he targets an evil teen he is unable to stop the teen from running away and diving under a car. At no time does this screenplay have A-X-L take down even a single evil peson whether evil teen or evil military contractor who created him. Sure, he can run and bark like heck... but no where do we see a billion dollar weapon in action.Also, one could ask why A-X-L escapes from his creators in the first place?
Not a clue. After all, he was created to save the lives of our soldiers at war. Kind of a noble invention, yet as the movie begins he's gon AWOL. Why would he not wish to return to his creator and his mission to save our soldiers lives. That is in fact his prime directive, to bond with a single solder at war. It's not like he's a nuclear bomb we could debate. Again, screwy screenplay where evil creator is not really evil. One could say that A-X-L going AWOL was super dog being very, very bad dog!The notion one could build or rebuild an A-X-L in a garage with a soldering iron also left me scratching my head.Fun idea with an awful, nonsensical screenplay.",negative

Monster Trucks,"I'm actually quite surprised Chris Wedge, the director who gave us the first Ice Age and Robots giving us his first live action family feature. Now it might have looked good on paper and could have possibly been better as an animated feature but this movie is a monster shame. X-Men's Havoc, Lucas Till takes the lead role as disgruntled, unhappy teenage Tripp who works at the local scrapyard which also serves his hobby of building his own truck. Jane Levy impressed me earlier this year with Don't Breathe and it's hard to believe that they're both the same actress, here being the sweet yet geeky town girl who has a keen interest in Tripp. It's a silly plot for a silly film but is too far fetched and weak with too many plot holes in surprised the film stayed together. Strange and undiscovered, intelligent creatures accidentally get released from their underground habitat. Feasting on oil and having an unlikely ability to power vehicles, basically a slimy horse with a metal shell. There's a few surprises of a supporting cast with me thinking ""oh look, it's so and so"" but none help prop up the all-round poor performance. I actually wonder what convinced them to star in this film. It must have been tricky to come up with a monster that's grotesque yet cute and friendly at the same in the end resembling a Jabba the Hutt with the characteristics of Toothless and E.T. Actually the films has some elements of both previously mentioned but more Iron Giant and Mac And Me. The special effects were good, not perfect but served the film well enough. The stunt driving was impressive and offers the most fun in the story as the film lacked any real comedy value. The soundtrack is okay but nothing memorable from David Sardy.It's possible this film was doomed from the beginning having problems with post-production that kept pushing the release dates back to well over a year. Even Nickelodeon had pulled out at one stage. It's unfortunately a step backwards for Wedge and for everyone involved. This might be a film they could possibly want to forget about but, it actually serves a purpose and the much younger audiences actually seemed to enjoy it. But I'm sorry Wedge, if the future of your live action films end up like this, I suggest sticking to the drawing board. It's brainless and more for the younger geeks among us. Running Time: 4 The Cast: 6 Performance: 4 Direction: 3 Story: 3 Script: 3 Creativity: 4 Soundtrack: 4 Job Description: 2 The Extra Bonus Points: -5 for being a terrible idea even for a kid's film. 28% 3/10",negative
Monster Trucks,"I took my youngest child, six years old (nearly seven), to see this yesterday. He bounced around like Tigger the whole way through, and only paused to turn around once in a while to tell me ""This is the best movie ever!"" This coming from a boy who loves everything from Harry Potter, Star Wars, Top Gear (and Grand Tour), to Tractor Ted and Octonauts.As an adult, it was a perfectly acceptable way to spend a couple of hours enjoying the company of my child. There's not a lot to the story, so if you've seen the trailer you won't be surprised. The monsters straddle the line well between being ""monstrous"" and cute (my boy acted suitably scared until it became clear that the monsters were on the good side, after which he loved them).He came out of the cinema asking when it would be available on DVD, so on balance a glowing recommendation from a 6 year old and a warm fuzzy one from me.",positive
The Physician,"Not only is this film historically inaccurate, but it is also terribly unlikely, childish and ridiculously stupid. It tells the story of an uneducated English barber, who (with no knowledge of Persian, Arabic, Hebrew, and more importantly, no knowledge of philosophy, mathematics, medicine, etc. and perhaps a total illiterate), disguised as a Jew, travels to Isfahan to seek medicine training from the greatest physician of the world, Avicenna. Up to this point, the movie is a total work of fiction (except that Avicenna was actually the greatest physician of the time and Isfahan was a center of civilization), and highly unlikely, but not quite stupid yet. The shameless stupidity starts when this young man (again, with no knowledge of Persian, Arabic, Hebrew, philosophy, mathematics, medicine, etc.) attends Avicenna's classes without any problem, and in few months(!) starts guiding Avicenna in treating different diseases! He even helps Avicenna to realize that plague is transmitted by rats! Seriously?! The greatest physician/philosopher (and a polymath) of the 11th century, whose books were taught at most European universities as late as 1650, does not know something in medicine (of course no shame), but an uneducated barbarian lad does discover confidently! Great!More ridiculously, this lad (who has come from a time England was full of superstitions and religious dogma) is shown advising the great philosopher to grow up of his religious dogma(!) and dissect corpses for medical purposes! He even takes a 20th century ""human rights activist"" tone when saying this ""let's dissect"" advice to Avicenna! Were the creators of this movie high on something?! Perhaps they were, because they later show that this barbarian dissects a corpse, performs a colon surgery(!) on (and upon the order of) a drunk(!) Shah who goes to war with the Seljuks right after the surgery! And during these all great ""scientific"" discoveries that the barbarian does, the great Avicenna appears no more than an assistant! There is also a very ""cheap"" parallel love-sex story, as well as quite a few 21st-century(!) urban-Persian conversations going on in the background The historical inaccuracy is not the main thing annoying me here: It is rather the stupidity and unlikeliness that annoys me the most. This movie is as ridiculously stupid as if it was telling a story in which Sir Isaac Newton has a Mongolian student who speaks with him in Mongolian, and shows him the true scientific method, helps him develop calculus and ultimately spreads Newton's science around the world, while escaping with his Jewish lover during the ""Napoleonic"" wars! Probably some Ali-Baba also appears during the ""Napoleonic"" wars too! Ah, yes, and Newton commits suicide when he realizes his library is flooded by the Vikings! (as in the movie Avicenna commits suicide, in more of a nihilistic 20th century gesture, when he realizes the Seljuks set his library on fire) No, the historical true Avicenna did not commit suicide. He did not have any English students. He did not die in Isfahan, nor around the time that Isfahan was defeated by the Seljuks. Moreover, no one around that era was able to teach Avicenna how to do medicine. No one was able to perform a colon surgery during that time (still, even in 21st century, no patient is able to fight in a war right after a colon surgery), and finally, English was not among the spoken languages in 11th century Persia. If the creators of this movie really wanted to produce such a childish fairy-tail, why did they even bother themselves using the name (and abusing the reputation) of a real historical figure?! They could have introduced some bogus character in a fictional country that well matched their boring fairy-tail. Besides the historical inaccuracy and childish unlikeliness, I do not see any artistic achievement in the movie either: just lavish production, resulting in an unnecessarily long/boring movie (that reveals nothing about Avicenna's youth/life/achievements), and flashy scenes, bad clichéd acting, depicting inaccurate architectures, clothing, races, faces, etc. Quite a blockbuster garbage that stupidly tries to tell us very unlikely lies about the history and life of (one of) the greatest physician of all time.",negative
The Physician,"All things considered I recommend this movie, It's picturesque and captivating. The music is very beautiful as well. And hands down to Ben Kinsly as always! It is a beautiful movie. The actors are brilliant and the story is very captivating. For once I didn't feel wretched when foreign cinema has tried to show Persia. At least Persians were speaking Persian even though they looked like Arabs. The illustrations that were used as the school material were the exact replicas of what remains from Ibn Sina and what you can see in his great book. That said the movie is very wrong in historical facts. What was supposed to be Isfahan looked nothing like it, but I suppose that's too much to expect. First the whole time line is wrong, Ibn Sina lived during the ruling of Saljugi dynasty and was caught up in their wars. He had to be on the run all the time for most of his life. The most important blunder of the movie which was quite central to the storyline is that Ibn Sina did not practice autopsy! He did! It was considered a sin so he had to steel corpses during the night. It is one of the reasons why people didn't like him. I have not read the book, I am talking about real documented history about him so maybe this blunder can be blamed on the book. I don't know!",positive
Jue di tao wang,"I know the modern millennials, the intellectually inept, and also the emotionally unstable will not get it, but this little gem is a return to a time when movies meant to entertain rather than degrade.Yes the acting is simple and fun, but this isn't a history piece. Yes the story line is quick and nostalgically pure, but it isn't a melodrama. But here's what this film is not: it is not full of disgusting pornography and unnecessarily perverted innuendos to keep today's ""youth"" entertained by pulling on their neanderthal limbic responses to get a bite. There is no blood or gore as we see it today that can ruin even an adult psyche by today's idea of cinematic ""morals"". It does not inject politically correct ethical impurities to persuade those of lesser IQ and mental instinct to clap at every pop culture reference toward popular political brainwashing dogmas. It does not pretend to be anything but what it is, a wholesome and entertaining flick. It is what movies used to be like and what I respect Jackie Chan for continuing to do even today, and that is make movies that a normal set of parents can go see with their adolescent kids and not worry of at any second two men that look like women will try to force some insanity of pseudo logic and propaganda on my family. This movie reminds me of what movies were like when actors didn't get paid $30 million apiece (even if these actors did - who knows) just to show up and ""act"". This movie reminds me of when going to the movies meant joy and entertainment, even if it wasn't necessarily deep. perfect for families and it made me smile, because it brought back a touch of hope that maybe, just maybe, movies may one day return to a time when no agenda needed to be pushed and simple entertainment for a family audience was the only desired effect.This is not Citizen Kane or Casablanca, but I still give it highest marks for doing that which in today's chaotic time of violence, filth, greed and social degradation may be considered ""boring"" by people who have passed the event horizon of stupidity. That alone earns it a ten in my book.There's hope.",negative
Jue di tao wang,"Look, I am a huge Jackie Chan fan and I have seen quite a few of his films that were accessible to American audiences. He has done some remarkable movies in his day. Anyone the hasn't seen Police Story 1 or 2 is missing some of the most hardcore action ever put to film. Legend of the Drunken Master is a classic film. Project A, Armour of the Gods, Rumble in the Bronx, Rush Hour, and on and on and on. I love Jackie Chan.This film however is bad. I mean capital B A D. The action sequences are poorly filmed. The dialogue is terrible. The story progression is horrendous. The acting is atrocious. I wanted to like this movie...I really did. Jackie Chan has broken down so many barriers. His comedic style is something that has given me laughs upon laughs for years. But it just doesn't work this time.I chalk it up to a poor script, the fact that he is probably slowing down some in his older age, and just bad direction, bad writing, and horrible editing.Watch at your own risk.",positive
Bajrangi Bhaijaan,"I went to see BB on the day of release with my wife and 17 year old son. I'm not Indian or Pakistani, but white British, so it was fun sat in a cinema full of Pakistanis, to watch a film that could have painted Pakistani in a negative light.Judging by the murmuring I could her there did seem to be some people during the interval that were not too impressed with the film - slow, boring, blah, blah - but by the end I think everyone left happy.From a white British guys perspective I thought it was a terrific film, and so did my wife and son. Great story, interesting characters, a ridiculously cute kid who stole the show without saying very much, excellent music, and some scenery that took your breath away.I thought Salman Kahn was great, much more three dimensional than I was expecting. Kareena Kapoor provided a massive dose of eye-candy and played her part well too, although it would have been nice for that part to have been developed more.But for me the star of the show - other than Harshaali Malthotra, the little girl - was definitely Nawazuddin Siddiqui. He is one of the most mesmerising actors I've ever seen. He could read the label of a sauce bottle and have everyone transfixed.In typical Bollywood style the first half was your typical setting-the-scene, which I thought was done very well, and it kept me interested throughout, but after the interval, as soon as Nawazuddin Siddiqui made his appearance, the film took off and didn't let-up until the end.All-in-all a thoroughly enjoyable film for all the family.",negative
Bajrangi Bhaijaan,"Despite being a Salman fan I was not too impressed with some of his recent flicks which in my humble opinion lacked freshness or had mindless direction, so when a family member bought tickets for this movie I didn't go in with high expectations. But to you dear reader I'll say GO WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS! It will not disappoint! And more importantly go with your heart - that is all you need for this 2.5 hours long film to become one of the best you've seen in years. It's just one of those movies with such heart-tugging moments and the highlight - the bond between Pawan (Salman) and Shahida (Harshali) - which is such a delight to see that you forget all about plot, logic, direction - not to say that the movie lacks that. The perfection in execution is definitely there, especially in the second-half. I watched it in the AVX theatre with at least 500 others and from the sound of it at least 75% of them regardless of age or gender were crying from the intermission onwards - sometimes because it was sad and other times because the screenplay was just so pure and unfiltered that it just made these happy tears bubble up inside of you.There is a certain level of comedy throughout and definitely some deep witty one-liners. My favourite was from Nawazuddin Sidduiqi (who played his role to perfection) who pointing at the current state of the media and their polarization of India and Pakistan proclaimed that ""Hatred sells. Mohabbat doesn't."" The movie has depth, a message, and the cuteness overload that is Harshali Malhotra. It also has a relationship and emotions so simple yet so extraordinary that they make a hero out of a common man. :)",positive
Big Game,"""Not political, not religious. He is just a certified grade-A psychopath."" I thought ""Why the hell not ?"" after seeing the poster of ""Big Game"". An adventure film, clearly aimed at a younger audience, with Air Force One crashing down somewhere in a Finnish forest and with the US president trying to saving himself with the help of a Finnish boy who just happens to undergo a local ritual so he can prove himself to the male population. And after I saw that Samuel L. Jackson also took part in this movie as the missing president, I didn't hesitate for a second. It's true that Jackson played some minor roles before this (""Oldboy"", ""Reasonable Doubt"" and ""Robocop""), yet I was pleasantly surprised by his last performance in ""Kingsman: The secret service"". So I went on the assumption that this was going to be a likable youth film, full of unabashed and not too far-fetched action.Boy oh boy. I didn't expect this to be such a crappy movie full of improbabilities, ridiculous situations and coincidences. Admittedly, it's indeed aiming for a younger audience, filled with teenage boys, who can have nice dreams that same night after watching such a film and imagine themselves acting as such a hero. But I'm convinced that most of them will shake their heads out of disapproval, while wondering if the makers of this film actually were convinced that they are really so naive.First lets start with the positive aspects. The scenery is matchless and breathtaking beautiful. I had no idea that Finland looked like that and I was tempted immediately to choose this country as a destination for my next holiday. Onni Tommila, a youthful Finnish actor, performed properly and does his job as the Finnish guide Oskari remarkably well. The entire film is clearly a homage to earlier films with youthful heroism as a central theme. It's a kind of film like ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" in which Short Round plays a prominent role or a typical Spielberg film like ""Empire of the Sun"". It brings back the nostalgia of fathers going to the cinema with their son to enjoy a cool film for guys. A prerequisite for such films is that the youthful contribution should smoothly transcend the ingenuity of the adults. In other words, the adults are presented as utter fools.What bothered me the most about this movie, were the totally absurd situations that arose. I admit, when you look at it from the perspective of a young person and you don't take it too serious, it comes across as an entertaining movie. A sort of ""Home Alone"" in a forest, where you're always a bit smarter and faster than the bad guys. But there are limits. Firstly I would like to purchase the brand of freezer they used here, because I think this high-tech-wonder-equipment is indestructible. Swinging under a helicopter, mowing through the woods, tumbling from a mountain, splashing into a lake and afterwards popping up out of the water like a purebred Russian submarine. And this ""undamaged"" ! Now that's what I call solid quality. But beware ! Make sure you don't end up inside this miracle appliance, because apparently it can't be opened from the inside. The number of accidental meetings is huge. Coincidentally, the probe with the POTUS is landing where Oskari made his camp. The freezer pops out of the water where Air Force One incidentally crashed. And you just need to follow a suspicious helicopter on satellite, and you end up looking at POTUS. The criminal Hazar (Mehmet Kurtulus) apparently isn't such a hot-shot criminal afterall, because he doesn't even know how to load an automatic rifle. And the way the satellite images are used in the Pentagon to follow the president, is just hilarious.I admit, It shouldn't always be that serious and occasionally a lightly youth film is also welcome, but there are limits to follies and ridiculous situations. As a boy I'd fall for this blindly. But as an adult, who started watching this film unprepared, it gradually began to annoy me more and more because of the series of stupidities. The final image full of patriotism and heroism ultimately, was a bit too much for me.You gotta cock it, Motherf . Oops.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",negative

The Boxtrolls,"This visually impressive stop-motion animated movie plays like a twist on H.G. Wells' classic The Time Machine: its underground-dwelling Morlocks - here a diminutive race called Boxtrolls - are harmless critters with a penchant for steampunk, unjustly feared and discriminated by their smug Eloi - here the class-obsessed citizens of Cheesebridge. A boy adopted by the creatures, with the help of a surface girl, fights against ruthless town exterminator Snatcher, who plans to destroy the Boxtrolls.The vocal talent assembled here is impressive; as much as I like Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, Elle Fanning and Isaac Hempstead-Wright (Game of Thrones' Bran), the standout is an unrecognizable Ben Kingsley in a magnificently loathsome, scene-stealing turn as Snatcher.Much like the authors' previous work Coraline, this isn't for small children. It's not as creepy as their brilliant Gaiman adaptation, but it features a certain amount of grotesque moments - like a character's face horribly swollen after an allergic reaction - not really suited to toddlers.7/10",negative
The Boxtrolls,"The film Boxtrolls is so jam packed with themes that cut to the core of our society that you might expect it to be cobbled together, choppy, overreaching, and pretentious. It is, in fact, none of those things.A thoroughly entertaining, not too cerebral, romp down one box conveyor after another, the film succeeds at wrapping it's central theme of persecution and prejudice in layers of equally significant ideas: group self-identification, class ambition, dalliant obsessions, self-esteem, and self-destructive addiction. It follows a nicely predictable plot arc that will satisfy your children while you ponder whether the plucky heroine's ostensible obsession with the macabre is likely a reflection of a Freudian complex with roots in her father's indifference. The bad guy with his crooked teeth and greazy hair is unmistakably evil. But at the same time the good guys aren't wearing the white hats. In fact, it's comparing and poking fun at both incompetence and maliciousness.The animation finds it's grounding in a setting that is reminiscent of Corpse Bride. From the industrial green palate of the box trolls to the stiff and starched characterization of the patrician class, the visual design of the film holds together well.After the film you'll walk out of the theater with lots of things on your mind, but you won't be walking out with a child who was bored to sleep or fits by another didactic feature of animated hogwash. That is an impressive achievement for any film.",positive
Dragon Blade,"I was invited to go see the Jackie Chan/Adrian Brody/John Cusack Chinese pseudo-historical period drama called Dragon Blade(though its Chinese title is more along the lines of ""Day of the Lion"" and has nothing to do with dragons or lions... confused yet? Just wait...).In it Jackie Chan plays a guard commander on the Silk Road who absolutely refuses to use violence, which pretty much makes him the worst guard ever. John Cusack plays a super-tired looking Roman General on the run leading a Legion who all speak English but have what is supposed to be a stirring Roman ""national anthem"" which is in Latin. Oh, and even though it's the year 458 BC, Jackie Chan can still speak English... but more Chingrishy than usual (cringing intensifies). Adrian Brody plays a ridiculously evil Consul and was developed by someone who had absolutely no idea what a Roman Consul was and thought it was hereditary, thereby necessitating he kill his father and blind his little brother so that ""he could never take power."" Seriously, dude. You have to get elected every year... and usually have to wait 10 before running again... sigh... . Consul Brody marches an army of 100,000 to conquer the Silk Road which is apparently about a day's hike even though it's like 8,000 miles away. Captain Chan and General Cusack strike up an unlikely and utterly unconvincing friendship to rebuild a city's outer walls, the Romans show how ""smart"" they are by wasting half their schedule constructing huge machines to do the work instead of using the ample labor supply available (it is, after all, a labor camp). The Legion and the ""Silk Road Protection Squad"" have what I thought of as a ""Bring It On"" style dance-off using their respective military drills, than that goes into a sparring match, and then hugs all around. And then they have a singing competition. No. Seriously. They have a singing competition... with a blind kid. In Latin. I made none of this up. . Jackie Chan intermittently goes from being a super-boring goof ball a la everything Chan's ever been in... to the film randomly cutting back to confusing, only-semi-explained flashbacks to when he accidentally suffocated his sister to death as a child, and then stabbed a general in the side who tried to comfort him... all of this leading (somehow) to his deciding to protect the Silk Road using the power of nonviolence forever. Then the ""bad"" Romans show up and the movie turns a 180 and goes into hyper-drive blood, death, and gore. That little blind kid? Thrown off the top of the city wall. John Cusack gets his eyes cut out, is crucified, and then is ""mercifully"" ended by Jackie Chan who breaks form to but an arrow through his neck (he then goes back to letting pretty much any and everyone kill for him and on his behalf until the end). Chan's impossibly-saintly teacher-wife takes 2 arrows in the back. There's a random, gruesome extreme closeup of a Roman soldier taking a Hun arrow in the face *through* a wooden plank. Huns (including the super-hot Lin Peng as Cold Moon), and 30-something other ""races"" all join together to fight the Eeevul Cosul Adrian Brody, and it's like something directly out of The Hobbit #3 with a flipping horde of eagles gouging eyes out, and doomed last stands. . Adrian Brody stabs his grandfather and almost beheads Jackie Chan, but then Chan does something with the weird little arm guard he's worn the whole movie (even though his whole squad is shown to practice with sweet swords that can be thrown and retracted, they are used once, ONCE the whole film. Brody gets his neck slashed, but opt to keep Jackie's kill could at 1 by then taking his dagger and stabbing himself in the heart while mumbling the (completely made up) Roman national anthem again. Then the remaining Romans and the member of the 30-whatever nations all join up to keep the SIlk Road safe and war-free for everyone. .The film is bookended by explorers who find the ruins of the city, and then decide not to tell anyone and keep it a secret... *even though that's their whole job. Their ONLY job.* . The End. . I haven't seen a movie this unfocused, confused, and just... bad... in a long while. If you find yourself in my position, with someone offering you a free ticket... Just. Say. No. Say no to terrible cinematography. . I wish I had extra hands so I could give this movie four thumbs down.",negative
Dragon Blade,"Allow me to start by saying if you are expecting a non stop action fight film....Don't. This film is one build on story not action. The fight scenes are good but not the best for modern day film goers. The film depicts events on the Silk Road involving Chinese, Roman, and other countries who travel and protect this region. I have read other reviews on here concerning this film and give it a low rating due to non-action scenes. This film is not a blow them up and add more dynamite type of film. It makes one think.Jackie Chan has begun a long line of historical films, that have been ranked low on his career but its these films that he is most proud of.

The Nut Job,"Before I begin berating this film, I would just like to preface that I would have considered it warranting of a 1 had it not been for the sufficing animation quality. This film is everything amiss about the cinema consolidated into one grotesque, insufferable mess. The pacing shows a stark lack of energy essential to this kind of film, which leaves the audience constantly expecting some kind of climax that the film never really manages to deliver, it's encumbered with purposeless characters and unexplained plot events (most notably a certain elderly character's antipathy for a dog whistle). In addition (as if everything previously mentioned weren't enough) the film has a completely incongruous scene in which the characters begin euphorically dancing to Gangnam Style, as well as a gimmicky, overdone dancing credits sequence involving the presence of a computer animated Psy for no explicable reason. Usually films tend to show a vestige of concern for subtlety when resorting to demographic pandering, though, this film just suffocates you with it.So, in short, unless you're searching for some ludovico technique material, avoid this film like the plague.",negative
The Nut Job,"This movie is pretty cool. It is funny and has a good amount of action. It is really good and I think you would like it too.This movie is all about a squirrel named Surly who, at the beginning, fends for himself and only himself (with his friend Buddy) until his actions contribute to the burning of the large tree where all the squirrels live, along with what little food they have left. He is banished to the city and soon finds a shop full of nuts. He makes a deal with another squirrel named Andie that he would get half and they would get half. They run into a lot of obstacles such as mouse traps, rats, guns and people.The main characters in the movie are Surly (Will Arnett), King (Stephen Lang), Grayson (Brendan Fraser), Raccoon (Liam Neeson), Andie (Katherine Heigl) and Precious (Maya Rudolph). My favorite character in this movie is Precious because she is such a funny dog and helps Surly and loves him after a while. She is also really funny.My favorite part in the movie is when Surly and Buddy meets Precious because, as I said she is my favorite character, and she is so funny. She thinks she has to hate the squirrels because her owners don't want animals in their shop but she soon realizes she loves them. She starts showing them tricks likes fetching, playing dead, sitting and she thinks that her tail is amazing because it wiggles a lot. She says it has a mind of its own! I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this movie for ages 4 to 10 because it is really suitable for a younger audience. I think younger kids will really love it.

Strange Magic,"If you look at the statistics of IMDb votes, you will find that Strange Magic unfortunately falls into the category of ""either you love it or hate it"" - very few in-betweeners.From a graphical animation viewpoint it is superb, with well thought out details backed by a lot of hard work. For adult viewers who like animations (like me of course!) the plot, musicality and characters are significantly above the average animation, with a well-balanced socially and politically conscious theme.The immense flake it has got in the media and the ""hate it"" viewers are totally unwarranted. Its main problem is the strong disconnect between its actual adult theme and characterization, vs the way it is portrayed and marketed as a family animation - a sort of fairy tale mummy bring kiddies to - and you can see many of the complainers fall directly into this category.In other words, it 'looks like' animation for kids, but the plot and dialogue is totally way too adult.... which is exactly what keeps it interesting for me! Kudos to Mr Lucas for doing this - just too bad the real target market segment of ""adults who like fairy tale animation"" is just too small for it to make any commercial impact. But... thanks all the same!",negative
Strange Magic,"I absolutely love this film, but I'll admit it may not be everyone's cup of tea. Pretty much non-stop singing through the first half and some odd song placement can be a bit jarring to some people. Overall though, it's a very cute and BEAUTIFULLY animated film with some great humor, on point voice acting, and top notch singing. Off beat in the best of ways with very memorable characters that really make the movie. I LOOOOVE Bog King and Marianne and their interactions with each other. Just weird enough to be a cult classic, in my opinion. Definitely worth a shot, if you have an hour and a half to spare some day. You may just love it!",positive
The Hurricane Heist,"This is my first review. But i just hadto write one!I think this might be the worst movie ive ever seen - if i wanted a serious film. However, its so bad that its actually kinda good because its funny! It makes zero sense! The cars are being blown over but the people are stood there just fine. Barely even a hair moving! At one point theres a hurricane outside but they have their windows open like its a sunny day! They can open doors and things with ease! Its so fake its funny.As for the end! It looks like some sort of tornado is chasing them. They're supposed to be in the eye of the storm so how do they manage to outrun the storm? They should hit the other side of the eye! Like i said, its pretty silly! If youre after a laugh id watch it because its so bad its good!!",negative
The Hurricane Heist,"Again if you like your low budget movies filmed on a iPhone, student actors with their mates writing good reviews then this film is NOT for you!!!

"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny","To be clear, this movie shares a bit of a plot with the first, however the two are very different. I'm disappointed, because I was expecting a sequel, however once I just accepted this for what it was (A Hollywoodified remake) I started to enjoy it. My biggest disappointments come from terrible music score, why not just use the same one or maybe an altered arrangement? the score is generic martial arts movie.Secondly, far too much CGI, from fights, to stunts to locations. Just very jarring.Overall, this movie just tried so so hard to be more epic than the first, however lacked a vision, a poetic feeling and spiritual message like the first. Enjoy it for some brainless fun and some OK fight scenes, but don't expect it to be anything like the first.",negative
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny","I don't know how they could take a masterpiece like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and destroyed it. This sequel has nothing of the first movie except for the title. Maybe i am too harsh, but Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was an epic movie, with good story line, legendary character in Li My Bai, great chemistry between characters and epic ending. So based on that my expectations for this movie were high. Plus if you put Donnie Yen, and Jason Scott Lee on top of that you would expect nothing less than the previous movie. But, no. In CTHD 2, the story is terrible, the characters are weak, empty and shallow,there is no connection between them, the directing is bad, and the worst part is, it's in English. The only good thing are the fighting scenes and they are average at best.So to summarize this movie is an average Chinese kung fu movie with some decent action, sword fighting scenes. As a Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon sequel its a big disappointment and not worth watching.",positive
Outcast,"I went into this expecting crap, and I guess there are lots of weird things in the film.For example, it bypasses the language barrier by giving everyone involved the universal translator, and the Chinese characters speak English in distinctly British accents, wtf.Also, it combines elements of both the Crusades and Chinese Imperial stuff into a single film, which was interesting.Hayden Christensen punches a woman in the face. I found that funny, considering the nobody made a fit about ""violence against women omagazz"". Then again, the film does depict lots of women and some children being slaughtered, it probably would've gotten a pg13 for that if the censors got their hands onto it.The dialog is somewhat cliché, then you also have the white savior cliché in which Nick Cage and Hayden Christensen kick Chinese ass to save Chinese people from other Chinese people, but I'm cool with that. But honestly, the film does in fact fulfill its duty to entertain. There are lots of sword fights, some cool (although anticlimactic) arrow scenes, and a nice supply of blood, but not in a particularly gory way.The story is somewhat nonsensical, I guess the only defense to that is 'who cares'.Over all though, it still was kinda FUN, nothing really made me cringe, and the Chinese theme in a non Chinese film is somewhat refreshing. So my final verdict is: 6/10 fun but not particularly memorable.",negative
Outcast,"Wooden acting, predictable plot and poor cinematography. American imports with bad accents in a Canadian production with Chinese money. Guilt ridden ex crusaders in China save Prince.I think the entire movie is summed up by the final scene were the camera pans up to sky. The entire crew must have breathed a collective sigh of relief that the nightmare was over.Clearly made for a DVD release I doubt this one will ever even make it to TV, it's that bad. I agree with previous reviewers that the fight scenes are not badly done, camera angles and tight shots tend to spoil it, its not meant to be an art film. There are too many examples of hero versus 20 guys that wait their turn, surely this fell out of favor as a fight choreography 25 years ago.Don't waste your time or money.",positive
The Young Offenders,"Having watched the TV Series first and fallen in love with Conor and Jock's escapades, I finally got around to watching the film. While it is still still fun, outrageous and cringeworthy (in a good way), the film isn't as good as the series. The characters feel slightly more 2 dimensional . If I had seen the film first, I doubt I would have wanted to watch the TV series.
It's still an OK film and a good length, at less than 90 minutes and you can see the green shoots of what the TV show was to become.",negative
The Young Offenders,"Being from Cork myself, this film ticks all the boxes. There was a lot of talk about it, so going into see it I was feeling it might fall short, as normally films this hyped turn out shite. From the moment this film starts it is just so funny right till the end. I'm not sure will many people outside of Ireland get the humor, but this is one of the funniest films I've seen in a very long time, as I can relate the two lads to so many people I grew up with and PJ Gallagher was brilliant as the crippled dealer. Some brilliant characters in it and every joke was right on the money. I really do hope we get a sequel!",positive
Queen of the Desert,"This film was an attractive costume drama which would not have been out of place on Masterpiece Theater, but anyone familiar with Gertrude Bell's achievements and who has read the book 'Desert Queen', will be disappointed at how much was left out. Yes, she was born to a wealthy family, had a brilliant mind, earned a first class degree at Oxford - even attending Oxford was a rarity for a woman at that time. She mixed in the best society being very well connected socially, and also enjoyed the company of many intellectuals of the day. Yes, she fell in love with Henry Cadogan and mourned his death for seven years. She had been prevented from marrying him by her overly possessive parents on some very flimsy grounds - he was a gambler and had no fortune, when they could have easily set up a trust fund for her which he could not touch. Her parents apparently even opened her mail to ensure that she was not being led astray. Her dutiful devotion and love for her parents may have caused her later infatuations and unrequited love for the wrong men. Her friendship with the married Doughty Wiley was shown, as was her iffy working relationship with T. E. Lawrence who supported her while being quite catty behind her back, but her later unrequited love for Henry Fitzsimmons, who used her but refused flat out to marry her, was not. Nor was her long and very close friendship with King Faisal of Iraq, which began when he was Prince and whom she had been instrumental in supporting on the throne. As Faisal's wife and family remained in Mecca and Gertrude became his close adviser, many suspected that they were lovers.Her years of round the world tours to get over Henry's death were left out. Eventually she began her journeys through the middle east and gained the knowledge which put her in the center of things in WWI as a source of information about the Arab tribes, and supporter and close adviser to King Faisal. She was present at the Paris Peace Conference when the winners, desperate to get their hands on the oil, divided up the middle east between them, largely reneging on the promises to allow the Arabs their own kingdom and instead installing puppet kingdoms under British and French mandates.The film ended with a very brief meeting with Faisal and his brother Abdullah, and an epilogue about the creation of Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia where Gertrude Bell had helped define the borders and choose the rulers. But there was much more to the story. After the heady success of helping to create the modern middle eastern kingdoms, being appointed Oriental Secretary awarded the CBE, and being Faisal's right hand woman, called upon every day not only for advice, but companionship, games, tennis, Gertrude found herself becoming less and less important as her task had ended. It probably did not help that she was a woman and had trodden on quite a few toes on the way up. Men would have felt threatened by her and wives would have been jealous. She concentrated her efforts on her writing and establishing the Baghdad Museum, but her life had become empty and no doubt she felt unwanted and useless. Faisal saw less of her and spent more time in Europe 'taking the cures'. Her family fortune disappeared in the post war changing times and she was reduced to living alone if not in poverty, but 'straightened circumstances'. In 1926 she died of an overdose of sleeping pills, which was ruled an accident.Other than leaving half the story out, the other serious flaw was the miscasting of Faisal and Abdullah and their very brief appearance at the close of the film. The two actors should have switched parts. Abdullah, the great grandson of today's King of Jordan, was short and round faced, Faisal was tall, thin, charismatic and extremely handsome. His leadership of the Arab revolt was the reason for the allied win over the Turks. From the film one would think she had only met with Faisal for one minute. Showing more of her relationship with Faisal would have perked up the film enormously. Overall, this topic should have been a Masterpiece Theater miniseries running for at least six hours.",negative
Queen of the Desert,"A film worth seeing, explains the birth of present middle east. A visionary feast and both Nicole Kidman and James Franco's acting is superb.Most critics didn't give it a thumbs up but for me it was a beautiful film, maybe because the lead was a woman who changed the course of history! For anyone who doesn't know anything about the middle east should see it just for history and Gertrude Bells significance in history.... The photography is exhilarating and get to see the desert and the oasis in their beauty. The movie might lack historical details but it focuses on Gertrude Bells life, so that is understandable. But at least for people who never knew what or how the middles east came about and what she did it is an eye opener. A must see file for me!",positive
Slow West,"I'm a huge fan of the Western genre. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is one of my all time favorite films and I'm always on the lookout for a modern western that can kick-start the genre. I was hoping this would be the film but unfortunately I don't think most people will find it appealing. The acting is top notch, especially from Fassbender and Mendelsohn, but ultimately the pace and the melancholic ending will leave most people wanting more. If you liked the look and feel of The Homesman or the slow burn of Meek's Cutoff check this film out. If your looking for an action western with a Hollywood ending then this is a film you should skip.",negative
Slow West,"This is my first review, I wanted to save it for a movie that I was touched by and one that gave me something I didn't expect, in essence a film that gave me everything that I thought it wouldn't. Slow West magnificently portrays the human condition, with all it's defects and strengths. It rather wonderfully and in a very subtle way exposes it's capacity for love and betrayal, loyalty and mistrust, fear and courage. It reveals to us that desperate good people do terrible things to survive in hard times, how hard bitten and essentially broken souls have the means and wherewithal to do good and be forgiving. It shows how we can be innocent and naive and yet still be able to teach, how we can be overly aggressive and yet protective, greedy yet also so very giving. The true wonder of this film is to me is that it exposes to us that all of us can be all of the above at some point in our lives, that we all have the capacity for evil or good and sometimes it is only circumstance that turns us either onto or away from a particular path. It's theme to me is the delicate balance between success and death in the American west during that period from the standpoint of choices made, and to my mind I think it succeeds in portraying this exceptionally well.Many of the reviews I have read on here in regards to this film say it is far too slow, I don't think it is at all, it is a journey, a gradual layering of the story building to a climax, it is not supposed to be action and bells and whistles from the off, I think it is a film that ultimately is trying to make you think; you are invited to explore who we are and what we are capable of as humans in hostile conditions. The performances are excellent all round, the thoroughly underrated Ben Medelsohn particularly as the 'realist' outlaw and Michael Fassbender who commands the screen in all his scenes, as he so often does. I think the writing of the dialogue is fantastic and nuanced, the humour dry and cleverly interspersed and the attention to period detail almost faultless. My only gripe is that there are a couple of scenes that don't seem to fit the narrative, maybe that is what slows this film down for some.I understand that that this kind of western or period drama for that matter is not to everyones taste, that for many 'action' is the byword by which these films stand or fall, well to that I say to each their own. If however you are keen to watch a movie that attempts to reflect back to you just what it means to be a person with all a persons flaws, and how circumstance can shape us into the judged or judgemental, then this very well may be a worthwhile watch for you.",positive
Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip,"I loved this movie. Let me tell you personally, it is a thousand times better than Star Wars: TFA. Of course, TFA is a great movie; however it does not live up to the standards set by this masterpiece of a movie.Brilliant story, brilliant performance, brilliant music.If I could score this an 11/10, I would very happily do so.Take a chance and see this movie, don't listen to the other reviews.No spoilers from me because this is a story you wont want to have spoil-ed, trust me on this.Great movie.10/10",negative

The work these actors and actresses put int to this pile of cinematic awesomeness brings an old, stale, peace of nostalgia back to life for a new generation to enjoy. Not only does it keep an old 80s bit of history alive but, it helps build bridges between children and their parents as they can share a part of their childhood with each other that will last a life time.This movie is a 10/10 because I Hate Everything.

Hector and the Search for Happiness,"I'm not sure which movie the other people on this review board have been watching, because when I went to see this (in Canada), even total strangers were compelled to connect afterwards about how painful it was, while leaving the cinema to meet their other friends who had walked out earlier.. I normally love Simon Pegg, love what you might call ""existential"" or ""whimsical"" stories such as Amelie, Walter Mitty, About Schmidt, anything along that broad spectrum between Love Actually and Ingmar Bergman. But, THIS..Paradoxically, one of the life-rules it thrusts down your gullet with all the subtlety of feeding a foie gras goose, is that you should be true to yourself, and genuine....exactly like this movie isn't.It's told from a distinctly lazy, privileged, patronising and comfortable point of view, and even offensively stereotypical and superficial about non-western cultures:In China it's all big dinners and sleazy old white dudes with high-class Asian hookers and migrant workers everywhere..Africa is all about dangerous and primitive conditions with a few casual lines of dialogue thrown in about how foreign aid doesn't get to the people who need it.Simon Pegg, after being pistol-whipped repeatedly in the face, defecating in a bucket and left to rot by kidnappers, then being dumped by the roadside and narrowly escaping death...is miraculously and instantly in the mood to party. Cue: Reams of colourfully dressed Africans, apparently with nothing better to do than to than dance around as if straight out of a Kenyan tourist board commercial, make everything OK again in, like, two minutes flat. Any human would be traumatised and need recovery in hospital after that ordeal but there is no time to be authentic in this movie, we've got synthetic emotions to ooze and platitudes to preach. ""The audience won't notice..""Oh, and then there is a revelation of an interracial gay couple, which is meant to be poignant and meaningful, except we really don't know these guys and therefore don't care whatsoever. It's as if the filmmakers assume that the audience are brain dead peasants who have been locked in a room their whole lives: ""Gay interracial couples exist folks, it's true"" Wow...really?Sometimes a bad movie is just a bad movie for whatever reasons and that is a shame, but what really got me so incensed with this was the flippant way it dealt with huge important concepts such as: Happiness, relationships, race, sexuality, culture etc.etc.It's like a casual holiday travelogue with a thin veneer of paint on top, promising: ""If you, as a human, sometimes think about your place in the universe and what happiness is, then you will want to watch this and be rewarded by learning a thing or two."" To which I responded: ""Great, here's my $15, can't wait!"" But underneath the paint there is just...more paint. Maybe, just maybe, they could make fortune cookies with the messages in this movie, that might fit the maturity level of the wisdom it literally RAMS down your throat.And don't get me started on the jolly Tibetan Monks...the Dalai Lama would cringe.",negative
Hector and the Search for Happiness,"This is for the first time I am writing a review for a movie despite the fact that i have been a big time movie buff for 20 years.

Most.... but not all,,, for some people are so inured into the vagaries of life that they might lose patience with a somewhat slow pace of the movie. Well, losers....have patience...it will pay. If you are someone who values time....YOUR TIME...ON THIS PLANET...you've gotta watch this.

Black Sea,"This film is about a submarine captain who is fired because of downsizing. He decides to form his own submarine team to hunt for the gold that Nazi Germany is rumoured to have left in a sunken submarine at the bottom of the Black Sea.I was initially put off by ""Black Sea"" because of the heavy accent, which made it hard for me to understand the dialog. Fortunately, the film is thrilling and captivating, so I was drawn by the film again. The plot keeps me on the edge because there is something happening in rapid succession. The divide between the British and the Russian crew is well portrayed. There are even mind games which is probably unexpected in a submarine thriller. The claustrophobic environment of the submarine, and also the constant fear of catastrophic events happening keep the adrenaline pumping. The ending is unexpectedly moving, I was very sympathetic towards the characters. It even gave me tingles down my body. I enjoyed watching ""Black Sea"".",negative
Black Sea,"As a former submarine sailor I watch every submarine picture that is exhibited. None are exactly as it was or is. Most are a lot of fun to watch. This movie was very good as it entertained and kept you on the edge of your seat. This is a good escape from all the movies that are all explosions, blood and gore, fantasy, and vampire trash. This has a believable storyline even if the FX are a little unbelievable. You should watch this movie and enjoy it. Jude law is surprising in the role of the Capt. and is a great deal different than previous movie roles for him. The clash of personalities adds to the excitement through danger and mechanical malfunctions.",positive
The Smurfs 2,"The Smurfs 2 Zero Stars I Remember a long time ago when I Saw the smurfs cartoon, it was funny, charming, amazingly and whimsical, it had tiny blue creatures who battle gargamel and much more, but sadly the smurfs movie was a disaster and it made a big amount of movie at the box office and this one could be even worse, this is one of the most pathetic sequels ever made and one of the worst movies of the year so far, what a joke. this takes place 2 years after the events of the first film when the smurfs time traveled to new york, when in the case smurfette gets kidnapped by the naughties (one of the them played by a truly wasted Christina ricci in a what is she doing in the film like this) and the smurfs go to Paris to save her from gargamel and the naughties, Neil Patrick Harris is wasted yet again as the person who is trying to help the smurfs along with his wife, gargmel played by an embarrassed Hank Azaria of the simpsons fame who is completely lost.The CGI is impressive but so what?, the screenplay is simply a waste of absolute time, the story goes nowhere, the writing is pathetic and a editing is a complete disaster, sadly this is Jonathan winters last film and a pathetic one if that. this is a truly dreadful film that is even worse then the first, MUCH worseWait for avatar sequels in 2016 if that.",negative

I have to say, despite any toffee nosed film critics who have panned this film, we thoroughly enjoyed it. It was equally good, if not better than the two previously mentioned films. The animation, especially the interaction between real life and CGI was impressive. It was funny, fast-moving, and at times emotional. Gargamel's performance was wonderful. Some of the visual effects, such as the ""Roue de Paris"" coming of it's axle and rolling through the streets of Paris were amazing. Ignore the film critics, go there with your kids, and try and watch it through the eyes of a child and enjoy. Great in 3D. We thought it was better than the previous Smurfs movie.",positive

Jack mcbayer takes over the clumsy role from the late Anton yelchin who was great in the role.",negative

The Tale of The Princess Kaguya,"I liked this to a good extent, and my rating goes up because of the last 15 minutes, which are so magnificent. Those last several minutes and the first act are truly brilliant, but for some reason, the film sort of lost me in its middle and a little more than that. Not completely lost me, but it did get a little too much and it got to less interesting overall. I can't say I completely agree with the critical acclaim it's gotten, but I think it's a good, sometimes very good, film, definitely made stronger because of certain scenes. The sound mixing here is incredible, and the voice acting (in its original language) is pretty fantastic as well. Overall, still recommended but with reservations, yeah.",negative
The Tale of The Princess Kaguya,"I've already watched this film 3 times! I was deeply moved and couldn't stop crying every time.I believe that ""Princess Kaguya"" is the best Ghibli film in the past 10 years because of the beautiful hand-drawn animation and touching story.Japanese audience and critics are also very positive for this film, compared to other Ghilbi films.Hayao Miyazaki is a genius but his recent films are always controversial since ""Haul's Moving Castle"".One of the reason is that he relies on his imagination and makes light of a script. That's why quite a few people can't fully understand his recent films and sometimes blame them. (""The Wind Rises"" was a tragedy in this meaning.)Isao Takahata, the director of ""Princess Kaguya"", is a very good director known for ""The Grave of Firefly"" but not so active since ""My neighbor the Yamada"". His philosophy is very different from that of Hayao Miyazaki. Isao Takahata thinks the scenario is very important and he prefers realism to fantasy. ""Princess Kaguya"" is based on the Japanese oldest folklore ""The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter"". But Isao Takahata transforms it into a universal humanistic story by describing Princess Kaguya as a realistic girl.This film contains many fantastic scenes and they play as good eye candies. But the brilliantly illustrated life and emotions of the heroine is the most important part in this film. And that's what the director wants us to try to sympathize.The beautiful and artistic style of this animation is suitable for this theme. Because this apparently unfinished animation gives us the room to imagine by ourselves.Isao Takahata says, ""The animations tend to deprive children of their own imagination by pushing them someone else's fantasy. We have to make another animation which let them imagine by themselves"".I can't wait to see the responses from the worldwide audience! Hope you will like this film too!",positive
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I was skeptical of this movie, to say the least. As a huge fan of both animes and the original manga, I doubted that Fumihiko Sori and his crew could do Hiromu Arakawa's masterpiece any kind of justice.However, the end result is surprisingly okay. Sure, the CGI tends to be an eyesore, the acting is all over the place, and some characters aren't remotely similar to their badass manga/anime counterparts (here's lookin' at you, Riza). But on the whole, this film kind of works. The screenwriters made good choices in terms of what to adapt and how to fit it all together, and some characters (mainly Hughes, portrayed by Ryuta Sato) work really well.Most importantly, the film has heart. I get the feeling that Fumihiko Sori and c:o genuinely cared about the adaptation, and that ain't nothin'. It's an ambitious production, though arguably an overly ambitious one.FAR from a perfect adaptation, and nowhere near as good as the animes or manga, but it's not an insult to the original story, and not a bad way to spend two hours of your life.",negative

The way they worked so hard and brought the characters to life was just beautiful)CGI: 9/10 (It's not that it was bad, but I liked some of the CG better than other parts. Like the fire and Al was my absolute favorite! And the way everyone interacts with the CG is amazing)Story Flow: 8/10 (I agree with most, there was a few parts that were a little slow/a little fast but overall it was a great story. I especially really enjoyed the 1st half and most of the 2nd)Costuming: 12/10 (don't even get me started. They did perfect my dudes. Ed's coat was epic and the blue uniform were just the best)Dialogue: 10/10 (The fact that most of the dialogue was word for word from the original content brought me to tears)Music: 9.5/10 (There is actually only one place that I noticed that I didn't like the music. Actually, it was that there was no music that bothered me, and it was only like 3 seconds long. Yeah maybe I'm being picky, but to me music is very important, and so I couldn't help but be pulled out of the flow a little in one scene. besides that, they were totally spot on)Accuracy to the Original: 9/10 (True, they don't stick to the timeline very well, but 90% of the content in the movie has happened at some point in the series, so I can't give them any less than 9/10)Over all I'm going to give it a 10/10. mainly because I have never seen an anime to live action adaptation do as absolute wonderful as they did with this movie. Now, there will be people who don't like it, and that's fine. It does have a specific taste and feel that not everyone will like. I will say, if you go into this movie expecting it to be a recreation of the original manga/anime then you will probably be a little disappointed. But if you go into it understanding that they had to create a story that fits into 2 hours, not knowing if there was going to be a 2nd movie, and understand that it is an adaptation not a recreation, then I think you will be pleasantly surprised!",positive
Leap!,"26 August 2017. Some people have criticized this movie because of the stealing scene. For those sensitive enough to have moral qualms about this criminal act and this movie, might just as well also condemn the Best Oscar Motion Picture Les Miserables (2012) for stealing wood in that movie. Subsequently, this criminal act has its consequences. Really for an animated children's movie the morality of the criminal is not as clear cut as it might seem as well. As for those critics whose insistence on historical accuracy and the relatively quick learning curve to become an amazing dancer are missing the nature of this fun, entertaining, in some ways simplistic presentation of an animated feature for young girls who still have dreams and a few boys who want to be inventors ala the prat fallen and accident-prone acclaimed comedian, Jerry Lewis, who died recently at 91 years old. And finally, dancing in a pub as a young girl can't be looked down on if one realizes this is a European setting where society isn't so prudish and the association of pubs (where family often gather) and bars is often confused.The use of animation in this movie was aptly chosen and is fined tuned to the spirited nature of the storyline, particularly the dancing moves which would have been quite unrealistic and poorly received if the movie had been live action instead. The animated dancing offers up a childlike fantasy experience of exciting idealistic movement and the fulfillment of the delicious pleasure of passionate dreams. There is an excellent but difficult and rarely achieved balance between animated realism and the girlish imagination of what could and is possible as seen through a child's eyes such like Bolt (2008) about a performance dog who believes his acting is part of his real persona. The landscapes, the buildings, cityscapes are often presented with vibrant authenticity yet with a sense of wondrous imperfection as animation as yet hasn't been able to completely replicate dense photographic images of the real world.In some ways, Leap! could be consider the young child's version of La La Land (2016) or Chicago (2002) in its depiction of the entertainment world, its exotic sights and sounds, the captivating energy and the enthralling emotional turmoil and the pulsating excitement of art. This great movie is about not giving up passion and pursuing one's dreams, who better message can an animated feature offer children?",negative
Leap!,"If you're a parent, and you believe in your children's dreams and potentials, you will love this movie!
In my review, I just want to extend my gratitude to the creators of LEAP. It's a breath of fresh air to see a film that encourages kids to dream and dream big. This world will try to steal your dreams, we need more movies like this to encourage children (and adults) to continue to follow their dreams.""Look at things not as they are, but as they can be.

A Walk in the Woods,"i was excited to see this film, the trailer looked good, but as is always the case nowadays. all the best bits are in the trailer. spoiler alerts!! i was bored watching this film, and the Redford and Nolte casting was wrong, as they were both 70 odd , but in the book they are in their 40's!. Also Katz in the book is very annoying, totally unlikeable, whereas , Nolte is a lovable rogue in the film, i saw Robert Redford was executive producer, so he may have paid for the film, hence he got star billing, even though he looked nothing like bill bryson, no beard, no paunch. this film would be fine on a Sunday afternoon TV film, i wouldn't recommend this film to anybody, and especially not bryson fans",negative
A Walk in the Woods,"I have NOT read the book...So the little 'incorrect' things or the little incongruities don't mean a thing to me. This movie is a delight to watch unfold. And soooo funny! I loved the contrast between Redford and Nolte, they really complimented each other; loved the unexpected people, and outrageous incidents. It was interesting to learn about the trail and trail-hiking--the hikers seem a special group of people. And it was interesting to learn about the problems of the forests, although I wonder what can be done about it (nothing stopped the American Chestnut blight). The scenery was beautiful--I would have liked even more shots. Best of all, however, was the hilarity. We all were holding our sides! Nolte was grand. Redford was elegant and refined. Emma Thompson is wonderful in every part she plays. And Mary Steenburgen is still so beautiful. It was good to see them all!",positive
Shin Godzilla,"The movie was a great satire on the Japanese Government during the time of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. The reactions by the Prime Minister, defense minister, etc etc during Godzilla's initial appearance perfectly recreate the indecision that lead to more people being killed in that country than necessary during the real life disaster. In short, this movie uses Godzilla to satirize the Japanese government. A new, more decisive body of government forms in the aftermath and one end of it wants to evacuate Tokyo to Nuke him and the other wants to make a more experimental approach by analyzing Godzilla's body chemistry (the science is actually pretty good and leads to a surprisingly tense climax that involves construction cranes pumping hoses down Godzillas throat). The scenes with the humans are also shot in a very dynamic and fast paced way. Characterization suffers (Japanese films do this thing where they just add an odd quirk to a characters personality and call it a day) but its all for the purpose on finding out how to take care of the giant monster rampaging through the city while minimizing human casualties. Believably too, like how the government would actually react would it have happened.As for the big guy himself, Toho definitely plays around with him a lot. He's still a big green iconic monster, but they change his design more than I've ever seen before. When he first appears in the movie, he's more like a tadpole and over the film evolves into the monster we know. But even then he does things like opens his lower jaw when breathing fire like the predator, shooting beams from his dorsal fin and tail, and there's even a VERY chilling shot at the end involving Godzillas tail with some imagery with broader implications on what Godzilla is able to do. But for all these new things that happen, there's a bunch of stylistic choices that keep it rooted in its history. There's music being used from the original 50's score than ever before (they use more than just that classic brass theme), Godzilla still has his trademark roar, and when he breathes fire in a way we've never seen before (it starts as gas, lights up into a jetstream of flame, and then concentrates into a beam) there's a classic sound effect played that we haven't heard in ages. In short, there's a bunch of new and classic stylistic choices in equal measure. Plus the scene where he destroys Tokyo is, in a weird way, gorgeous to look at.In short, this is the smartest giant monster movie I've ever seen. It's not for everybody but it's certainly for people who understand what that means.",negative
Shin Godzilla,"The film takes a somber, serious tone as to what would happen if Japan were attacked -- in this case, by a seemingly unstoppable foe. At present in Japan, there is an ongoing debate as to whether or not Japan should amend it's constitution to allow for an offensive military and this Godzilla film plays to exactly how powerless Japan would be in making it's own decisions during an attack of any kind. The reality is that the Japanese Prime Minister would have to ask for permission from the United States President before making an offensive move against a foreign threat and this film plays to that hard reality. This new Godzilla starts out as an homage to its former man in a monster suit so that when you first see Godzilla, you'll disbelieve what you're seeing, but this Godzilla evolves into something majestic and utterly awe inspiring in its power. What's more, this film makes it clear people die. In the Japanese release there's a lot of word play about how the government officials up high (on the fifth floor) make decisions that get passed down to people on lower floors that eventually hurt the people. I'm not sure how much will be translated, but the film is deliberately showing the disconnect between the political and day to day realities. Overall, the performances are good. There is one character who they, for whatever reason, decided to make speak English in odd an inappropriate times. This isn't a film for US audiences. The aesthetics will turn off a lot of non-Japanese young people accustomed to CG reality. But if you're open to learning about another culture, this is an excellent film, one of the best kaiju-films you'll ever see.",positive
Sherlock Gnomes,Utter pants film whose best bit was the voice from Ozzy. Even my young son predicted the ending before it happened and the jokes were pretty pants at best,negative
Sherlock Gnomes,"Breaking news from London-garden gnomes have been kidnapped! ""Oh fertilizer!"" This is one of many amusing jokes from the very British characters in Sherlock Gnomes, sequel to the 2011 animated film Gnomeo and Juliet. Although the plot of this family-friendly movie is somewhat predictable, it is still quite funny and clever. In this sequel, the formerly star-crossed lovers Gnomeo (James McAvoy) and Juliet (Emily Blunt) are married and have just moved to London where they are appointed by their parents as joint heads of the garden. Both Juliet and Gnomeo feel the pressures of their new leadership roles and the marriage begins to suffer through lack of communication and mutual appreciation. Meanwhile, their gnome friends are disappearing from homes all over London, and they attempt to search for and save them. With the help of Sherlock Gnomes (Johnny Depp) and Watson (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the adventure begins - to defeat the evil pie company called Moriarty (Jamie Demetriou) and save all gnomes. We also see that poor Watson is quite ignored and under-appreciated by Sherlock.My favorite aspects of this movie are the music, Johnny Depp and the ""planning"" sequences. I love the song choices used in transitions between scenes. If you are a fan of Sir Elton John, you will be pleased to hear many of his hits, including ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart,"" ""I'm Still Standing,"" ""Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting"" and a fantastic new song performed by the great Mary J. Blige. Johnny Depp is hilarious with his condescending British accent. I have seen almost every movie he has ever been in and he never disappoints with his comedic intensity. Another interesting thing that happens is when we see the inner workings of Sherlock's mind in 2-D black-and-white animation. One clinker for me is when super-intelligent Watson, looking for Gnomeo, says ""Gnomeo, Gnomeo! Oh don't make me say it - wherefore art thou, Gnomeo?"" (Of course ""wherefore"" means ""why"" in Romeo and Juliet.)The message of this story is a good one - that you will succeed by respecting the people who support you. Sherlock learns that lesson when he realizes that Watson feels that Sherlock isn't listening to him or respecting him. Juliet learns it when she realizes that Gnomeo feels as if Juliet is ignoring him, too.I rate this film 5 out of 5 stars because, almost all the scenes kept me laughing, the music is great, and I love the message. I recommend this movie for ages 7 to 18.Reviewed by Lucia F, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org.",positive
Angry Birds,"You know what? I went with my kids thinking I will get bored because the movie was rated around 6/10. I actually had more fun than the kids.I've watched the movie in 2D. The characters are rather 'mature' and some dialogues will appeal more to adults than to kids. It is not a 'childish' movie.The battle scene is wayyy noisy, long (it lasts about 20 minutes) and overwhelming, I noticed several young kids in the theater lost patience and quit standing seat and were getting agitated.Other than that, the birds are nice looking. I had no idea what this movie will be about as I'm not a big game player, but the story kinda keeps up well enough and the movie is 'dynamic' at most moments.",negative
Angry Birds,"The movie takes place on Bird Island, an untouched paradise inhabited by birds who are naive and innocent. These good birds know nothing of the outside world. They treasure eggs above all else, and are all carefree and easygoing, except for few. One of these birds is Red, a societal outcast who has had anger issues from the very beginning. Eventually, his outbursts become too much and he is sentenced to anger management courses, where he meets other misfit birds with similar problems.The birds are suddenly visited by green pigs, who are dumb but funny. The birds and pigs quickly befriend each other, but Red does not trust the pigs at all. Ultimately, the pigs reveal their true colors, and leads to Red leading the entire flock in a ""maddening"" frenzy of rightful revenge as well as finding the right means of dealing with rage.Everything about this movie is impressive . I can guarantee you this great movie will make you happy.",positive
The Little Prince,"The Little Prince is one of my favourite books. It's simply beautiful. I was looking forward watching this movie. And I'm deeply disappointed by how the director killed the Little Prince. The first part of the movie was nice, and the animation that told the Little Prince's story was amazing. Loved how it was created.The second part...you see how a book is killed. It was disappointing seeing how the movie director mutilated the personality of the Little Prince. In the end, this movie is not about The Little Prince. Indeed, it sends nice messages about friendship, love, what is really important in life, and how we can see the unseen. But it's horrible to see how the Little Prince story is simply destroyed. Catastrophic! Catastrophic!",negative
The Little Prince,"There is one thing you have to know before even read about this movie, and it isn't the summary: There is already a LOT of things telling the same old story of the book. How the pilot and the prince became friends, all the adventures and beyond, in other animations and endless other media. This movie isn't about those two characters only. It's about how this story can touch people since it was created, from toddlers to grandpas, in different ways and in different ages. I've seen people say out loud ""this is not little prince!"", but I say ""yes, it is!"". Want to see a pure version? Read the book. The animation and the characters are rich and lovely, the CG and the stop motion are perfect and well used. Everything is heartwarming. If you don't know the book, you'll read it after seeing this. If you do, I'm sure you'll cry a lot. And at the end of the movie you'll want a fox for you too.",positive
Ben-Hur,"Where do I begin with such a deplorable movie? Let's start with cinematography. The vast majority of the scenes are filmed in a frustrating haze of darkness; the excessive use of close-ups is nauseating; and, worst of all, the camera is constantly jerking throughout the film, which left me with a splitting headache when I left the theater.When compared with the classic 1959 version, the 2016 story is as humorously silly as it is shamefully insulting. Here's just a few examples: In the chariot race, our hero falls out of his chariot; manages, somehow, to hold on to the reins; is dragged for an entire lap around the arena; finds the incredible strength to pull himself up back into the chariot; and, most astounding, not a scratch is on him. Oh, by the way, Ben-Hur's chariot breaks up at the end, permitting him to have a climatic finish, literally rolling across the finish line.Then, there is Ben-Hur's mother and sister, who are miraculously cured of leprosy, but they do not have a clue as to whom they owe this miracle. They are totally unsympathetic characters - as, in fact, all of them are.The adoption of Ben-Hur by Roman Counsel Quintus Arius, which is crucial for setting the dramatic scene of Ben-Hur's return to Jerusalem from the galleys, is totally missing. Instead, in this latest version, Ben-Hur is reduced to a fugitive slave, running from the Judean authorities like a scared rabbit.In the 1959 version, the evil Macella dies in the chariot race, but with his last breath informs a bewildered Ben-Hur - in a triumphant tone - that his mother and sister are lepers and that ""the race goes on."" Ben-Hur, naturally, is crushed by the news. In the 2016 version, in stark contrast, Macella lives (minus a leg); the two tearfully forgive each other; and, at very the end, they ride off on horses into the sunset like some Grade B western.Please. PLEASE! Watch the critically-acclaimed 1959 version and you will enjoy perhaps the greatest Hollywood film of all time. However, if you choose, like me, to go see this latest version out of curiosity, remember that you have been warned.",negative
Ben-Hur,"The classic 1959 Charlton Heston version is the one I and the rest of the baby boomers grew up on and it remains one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time. But I was very impressed by the 2016 remake. Gone is the stilted dialogue and ""holy look"" (as Victor Mature described it) of the old time biblical epics. The 2016 version has a bold take on the classic and a fresh approach to the story. It surpasses the 1959 version in originality, imagination, and devotion to detail. The Roman legion is shown in all its scope, strength, and ruthless brutality. The character of Jesus has a prominent role, whereas in the classic version, he never spoke nor did we see his face. With anti Christian sentiment on the rise in the entertainment industry, I wonder if the negative reviews written about this film reflect the agenda driven bias of the critics. The sea battle was spectacular and far surpassed the 1959 version. The epic chariot race was a wonderful homage to the Heston version, complete with the awe inspiring stadium built into living rock and with giant statues in the middle of the track. The race itself rivals the classic one in intensity and imagination. Terrific movie, great acting, and intense realism.",positive
Attack on Titan Part 1,"A few minutes into the movie I was taken by surprise that the director chose to wildly mash up the characters and their relationships. Even though I really like the anime I was open to a new envisionment of the source material, since prejudice is something I try not to practice. Maybe the director wanted a new interpretation, while maintaining the essence of the series. But then it dawned on me that this new interpretation was leaky at best and the capturing of the essence was a parody. It was a 90 minute crap-fest of half-assed dialog, disinterested story telling and slasher-like violence. The movie also had a particular inability of finding a tone. Any tone. All the scenes feel staged, unreal and almost completely unrelated. Most disturbingly however was the implausibility. Nothing seems connected and nobody related. This is a waste of brilliant source material!",negative
Attack on Titan Part 1,"I had an amazing time at the Fantasia showing of this. The audience went wild. The visuals blew me away. If you like classic Godzilla, or better yet, any of the director's Gamera films, this is for you.Classic film effects ratcheted tension to the breaking point. The cheesy characterization was flawless and intentional. Superb experience on many levels. Also loud, but wonderfully loud.Remember the first tingling of fear when you saw Jurassic Park on the big screen? This is that good.If you are not comfortable with anime rules of exposition and emotional outpourings, you might find the human performances awkward, but the lean story moves things along and all the information you need to know about what kind of vividly portrayed vision of hell is going down is amply provided.This is a funhouse horror show.Most of us at the screening loved the melodrama. That's what sometimes works with giant monsters eating human beings and gobs of blood and flesh raining down and oozing out the windows.This movie is dark and grinds away into some truly discomforting terror moments, even as it careens around spiral roads of goofiness at dizzying speeds.If you liked the throwback elements of Fury Road, the classic effects techniques of this giant monster nightmare might appeal. Visually and sonically it was a huge thrill and totally unique. See it big.Does everything work? Who cares. I don't go to the circus for Shakespeare or some huge subtext feast on Netflix.I go to the circus to feel my heart pound as my head explodes.Thank you big screen for staying real.(PS. I think everything works, but I'm no pickier than I need to be to enjoy the ride, and this one's worth it.)",positive
The Lego Ninjago Movie,This movie does not follow the plot of the TV show at all. My son was bored out of his mind. There was very little humor and very little plot.

The Lego Ninjago Movie,My kids really wanted to see this movie badly. Usually I then hope the movie doesn't have a long dull spot in the middle where they tune out.

As an adult there was enough fun humor along the way and it's Lego; who can't like it :). I'd recommend this for a fun light enjoyable movie that is kid friendly.

Muppets Most Wanted,"What a relief the motley crew of misfits & creatures are back with a joustful tale.

Grateful that Kermit never got the memo and up for the challenge, the crew labours in unfamiliar territory to return to the stage whilst dark forces undermine the gangs every endeavor. The hunt is on as a bumbling investigation appears to be fruitless in catching the nemesis. An international amphibian man of mystery or has the limelight moved onto greener and humble pastures. An evil frog impostor is still at large, hiding behind precious jewels and treating the world as one magnificent stage. Will good prevail? The audience holds its breath.

Packed with one-liners gags and with the obligatory cross section of famous cameos including Tony Bennett, Lady Gaga, Celine Dion, Frank Langella and Ray Liotta to name a few there's all you'd expect from a Muppets musical comedy caper. This offering even excels it predecessor and brings the Muppet's even more to life with some CGI (footwork) but without taking away any of the puppet characteristics of the Muppets we've grown to love along side the human leads Ricky Gervais, Ty Burrell and Tina Fey who are on fine form. This is another proper big budget outing set in the 'real' world and not cheap TV movie nor is it based on a classic story. Most Wanted is a fine return to form and sits well with the classic Muppet capers. Highly recommended.",positive
The Transporter Refueled,"Yep it is terrible. In future if you want to reboot a movie franchise, please do so without enticing me to the cinema.

Ed Skrein or whatever his name is, is just not Statham, I don't like Statham, but he is a far better actor than Skrein.I am now forced to write additional lines because I am not allowed to write a review less than ten lines, about a film which does not deserve ten lines of my time or space on the internet.

Mr. Peabody & Sherman,"Warning: This entire review can be considered ""spoiler"" material, but it may save you from wasting a night out. Mr. Peabody and Sherman, is, without question, the worst movie of the year and absolutely should not be seen by elementary school age children. The movie starts out simple enough...then the bully clichés hit: Sherman is bullied by a girl; Peabody is bullied by a social worker. A social worker makes arbitrary and bigoted decisions based on a bully persona. And the family of the offending girl (the one who bullied Sherman in the beginning): White Yuppee Dad is definitely the boss with little wifey cow-towing to his ""my little angel can't do anything wrong"" attitude, regardless of her alleged opinions and peace-making efforts.In terms of how this ""film"" relates to the original Sherman & Peabody, as part of the Rocky & Bullwinkle Show: It doesn't. The original show had the two principals going back in time to a famous place or event. Sherman usually got into trouble and Peabody saved the day. Very innocent and known to us kids of the time to be a farce...like the accompanying ""Fractured Fairy Tales."" The Peabody in this film is a narcissistic megalomaniac; nothing like the character should have been. Very sad to see. Oh, and while I am at it...for any ""Family Guy"" fans familiar with the Griffin's neighbor ""Joe"" the cop....the Roman character in this film is ""Joe""...actually the same character drawn with the strong jaw and same voice. It doesn't work.

The animation was commendable.",negative
Mr. Peabody & Sherman,"I briefly remember the old Mr.Peabody and Sherman cartoons, the thing I'm glad here is that they did not try to make it live action, and make Mr.Peabody a CGI thing.

Storks,"I found STORKS in the way that you're supposed to find underrated/cult classics: by accident. When it was released, I bought into the collective sigh of underwhelm that most critics expressed and that was my mistake. It's easy to understand why the critical community didn't like it: in an era where Pixar, Disney and even Dreamworks keep churning out magnificently multi-layered heart-warmers that set the bar stratospherically high, STORKS doesn't register all that well. We've been spoiled by excellence. As a result, we've lost the ability to enjoy the simple pleasures of pure entertainment.And that's what STORKS delivers better than babies or packages: entertainment.You might have noticed people commenting on how forced and thin the storyline is and how uneven it feels, and those complaints are accurate. The plot is extremely thin (virtually an extended sitcom-sized premise stretched into an epic road-trip format), and the story moves so quickly that it goes too far too fast with nary any breathing room to savor the experience or give the characters the tension or time to build any real catharsis or change. But the characters are so authentic to themselves that you know just about everything you need to know about them from their first scenes.I think the main reason STORKS gets such middling reviews in print and here on IMDb is because it's an old-fashioned type of comedy: a screwball-slapstick hybrid. The emphasis on sight gags, pain-humor, and wackiness has generally been avoided in animated films as passe and vulgar--low comedy. The rapid-fire snark between the main characters of Tulip and Junior hearken back to the old Howard Hawks workplace comedies of the 1930s, which is definitely an acquired taste in the post-narrative style of humor found in kids entertainment today--where non-sequiturs and punchlines exist in a vacuum and visual comedy is derived from abstraction rather than plasticity. But the comedic energy and the variety of jokes from modern ""Office""-style cringe (Pigeon Toady) to the machine-gun-speed HIS GIRL FRIDAYy-style verbal sparring (Tulip & Junior), absurdism (the wolves), post-modern meta-humor (the boy and his parents) to classical WB slapstick of yesteryear, and the film is riotously funny because of it. At the end of the day, that's what STORKS wants to be: FUNNY.STORKS is not a great film. It's not a masterpiece like TOY STORY or UP. It won't win any Oscars and it won't be everyone's cup of tea. But there's an excellent chance that it will live on as a multi-generational favorite for the same reasons as dumb-fun-with-a-heart-of-gold treasures like SPACEBALLS, DUMB & DUMBER, THE NAKED GUN, and NATIONAL LAMPOONS CHRISTMASs VACATION:Because you can watch it 1,000 times and it will NEVER stop being funny.So try it out. There's a 50-50 chance you'll be among the ones who can't stop watching it.",negative

Shadow,"As ""Shadow"" (2018 release from China; 116 min.) opens, we are thrown in what seems like the middle of a story line. A kingdom's King and his Commander are arguing about the Commander's unauthorized challenge to a rival kingdom. The King is not pleased as this may undo the truce and alliance between the two kingdoms. But the real challenge is how to take back Jing City, held by yet another rival kingdom for the last 20 years. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil you viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest opus from Chinese writer-director Zhang Yimou, best known in the US for his masterful ""House of Flying Daggers"". Here he brings us a Chinese period piece with a Byzantine plot that I was able to follow only in the big picture. I am certain to have missed lots of nuances. But it really doesn't matter, because what we, or certainly I, came to this movie for are the carefully orchestrated, almost ballet-like, fight scenes, and on that level I was not disappointed. Both the one-on-one fights and the massive battle scenes are a thing of beauty. None is better than the invasion of Jing City in the movie's second half, as the battle takes place in the pouring rain. I don't really understand why the movie uses hardly any colors (it's not quite B&W but it's not far from it either), I imagine there is some artistic explanation for it.""Shadow"" premiered at last year's Venice film festival to good acclaim. Yes, almost a year ago. It is now playing a limited run (only 4 days) at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at was not attended well (exactly 6 people). That is a shame. If you are in the mood for another epic and Shakespeare-reminding film from China, I'd readily suggest you check out ""Shadow"", be it in the theater (if you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",negative
Shadow,"During the Three Kingdoms 1,650 years ago, deception was often employed to survive in the high courts of kings. The war commander of one nation is nothing more than a shadow. His twin brother, the real talent, bides his time in the underworld until he can stage a coup and take revenge upon the king. Yet decoys assume a life of their own, and the shadow twin may take the power and possessions of the one he serves, but only if he is willing to strike and at the right moment. A love interest could provide all the motivation he needs, or perhaps all the distraction to cause him to fail and to be recognized for who he is.There are many layers to this complex and resplendent film. Every frame is beautiful. Backgrounds are in bold black and white, with human figures providing the color. There is pulse quickening action, seductive romance, the eerily enchanting chords of the Chinese harp and ambient sound of rain and running water, wonderful dialogue, humor, history, yin and yang, intriguing stories, attractive people, fantastic acting and sword play, constant surprises, and more. Deng Shao plays both the shadow and the commander, and he does so brilliantly. North American premiere and the best film I saw at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival.",positive
The Darkest Minds,Personally I disagree with IMDB's low rating - I really enjoyed this film,negative
The Darkest Minds,"To be honest, I am not sure why lots of people dislike this film. However, I can personally say that I enjoyed this film immensely. Being a fan of the book series, I was already excited for the film's release, but was nervous about the YA novel adaptation. However, I feel that while the book and film are different in many ways (as they have to be, as there are things in the novel that can't be done easily on screen), the production team did a wonderful job of making the film their own, but sticking to the novel very well. Although it seemed fast paced at times, I was eager to see what would happen next. My mom, who has never read the series, left the theater and said ""well, now I'm going to have to steal the second book from you and read it, because I can't wait until another movie to see what happens!""
Please, do not listen to the negative reviews, and go see this film for yourself. I had the incredible opportunity to be a background extra on the set of the film, and saw firsthand how hard both the cast and crew worked to bring this film to life. Please go support to not only see an incredible storyline come to life, but to encourage future YA novel adaptations, female directors, and inclusive/diverse casting.",positive
Nebraska,"While the film has generally received anywhere from positive to rave reviews, I am decidedly in the opposite camp. It would appear that Payne was attempting to create some sort of dark comedy, but in my opinion the result turned out to be simply a tedious cartoon. All of the characters with perhaps the exception of the son Dave played by Will Forte, seemed very two dimensional with little, if any, depth unfolded or transformation effected by the conclusion of the film. The character of Woody Grant never moved beyond a sad and pathetic 75 year old man with a brain addled by a long history of alcoholism and cursed with the onset of Alzheimer's. Payne painted this in broad brush strokes with the character mostly gazing off into space, saying ""Huh"" when spoken to, and daydreaming with his mouth open. His wife Kate was something out of an Al Capp comic strip, a sort of overdrawn termagant wife played by June Squibb who usually yelled her lines to the camera, sort of like Olive Oyl as the ultimate bitch. The minor roles of the aging townspeople in the fictional town of Hawthorne, NE where Woody and his family visit en route from Billings, MT to Lincoln, NE in his quest to collect a $Million in a scam magazine sweepstakes, were equally as shallow and simply included, in what seemed to be a cynical stereotypical portrait of a small town in Nebraska, a collection of quasi Grant Wood American Gothic zombies, who do nothing but drink at the local pub and watch football on television. Local Nebraskans will tell you that older people in these communities are far more in touch with the world, and not living any kind of isolated life that may have existed 60 years or so ago or the bleak kind of picture of the past which Payne seemed to be trying to paint.I might subtitle the film as Nebraska: A Road Trip in Circles. From what I could gather, the storyline was supposedly intended to trace the process of family bonding (primarily that of son Dave and father Woody) through a bittersweet road trip revisiting family and friends along the way. Usually road trip movies offer some degree of character transformation by the conclusion. Here there seemed little if any change. Woody was still living his life in a hazy daze though now possessing a new truck and generator purchased for him by his son when they arrived in Lincoln and discovered there was no prize money. While his wife Kate exhibited one fleeting moment of tenderness toward Woody near the end of the film in a perfunctory kiss on the cheek, there was nothing to suggest that there would be any difference in their ensuing lives together. Perhaps the son Dave may have felt a bit closer to his father after the trip, but heading back to Billings, there seemed little sense of that. Again, I have no idea of what exactly Payne was attempting to accomplish with this film. It was anything but comedic or tragic or any kind of subtle ambiguous satiric mixture of the two. There was, however, some wonderful shots of rural landscapes, but unfortunately, the fine cinematography didn't prove quite enough to redeem the film overall.",negative
Nebraska,"Alexander Payne is one director who marches to the beat of his own drummer - films in Nebraska, uses black and white, and casts some parts locally to get the correct flavor. He doesn't miss a note.Nebraska is the story of a family of usual dysfunctionals living where else but Nebraska - a quiet, distant father with a little dementia, Woody (Bruce Dern), his two sons, David and Ross (Will Forte and Bob Odenkirk), and their perpetually complaining mother Kate (June Squibb). David sells home electronics and just broke up with his girlfriend; Ross works for a news station and recently replaced the ""talent"" up front.The current major problem is that Woody has received something akin to a Publisher's Clearing House certificate telling him he's won a million dollars. All he has to do is buy these magazines and check if the numbers are his. All Woody sees is that he won a million dollars. No one will take him to Lincoln to claim his prize so he starts walking - more than once - until David says he will take him.On the way, they stop by his parents' home town and drop in on Woody's brother and his family - a scary bunch. Kate takes a bus in and shows David around the cemetery in a scene you'll never forget, trust me. Woody runs into his old partner, Ed (Stacy Keach), and as word spreads that Woody is going to be a millionaire, everybody wants a piece of him, including Ed, who says Woody owes him quite a bit.This is really a character-driven film, with some of the most vibrant, fleshed-out characters ever on screen and some of the starkest landscapes, filmed in black and white, and giving the viewer the feeling of what it's like to live among miles and miles of farmland interspersed with small towns.Bruce Dern gives an Oscar-worthy performance as a lifelong alcoholic who has escaped inside himself, a man out of touch and seemingly untouched by any events around him. As the outspoken Kate, June Squibb is absolutely hilarious - always yelling at Woody, threatening to put him in a home, complaining about him, but just don't let anybody take advantage of him, or you'll have to deal with her.The sons mirror their parents, with David quiet and thoughtful but trying to bond with his father, and Ross, more confident and less sympathetic.In learning about his father's background, in talking with his old girlfriend (Angela McEwan) David begins to see the man that his father once was and what shaped him. And he finds out that love is sometimes an unspoken thing, but it's there all the same.A wonderful film, powerful in its simplicity. Don't miss it.",positive
Rio 2,"Well made but it is unbelievable how toxic the message is.Basically the whole movie from the very beginning is portraying the males as irresponsible dumb idiotic losers and the females as intelligent confident and independent leaders. What a disgrace. The continuous humiliation of the male character is shocking when you think that male actors actually accepted to lend their voices and play those roles. Avoid watching it especially with your kids around. And if you do decide to watch it simply try and swap in your head the two genders with different races, let's say swap male characters with blacks and the female characters with whites and see if you would find it worth watching.",negative
Rio 2,"As someone who hasn't watched Rio 1, Rio 2 was not confusing so I was able to understand what is happening in just the first few minutes. This movie features really amazing animation, check out the opening carnival and the bird dance. Secondly, with stellar casts, this is like a Disney musical except it's funnier. Kristin Chenoweth is over the top as a lovelorn stalker. Seems like a role she always plays. Expect lots of Shakespeare soliloquies parodying the classic Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet and many more. Thirdly, the amazon rainforest setting really enables us to be introduced to many new characters. From rapping sloths (Ke$ha anyone?) to taichi fighting old ninja turtles, Rio 2 does not rely on low-brow dirty jokes unlike some other movie I could mention (Madagascar? It also is named after a place). This movie is funny, exciting, and slightly touching, the perfect thing to watch with friends, family and partners alike.",positive
The Book of Life,"Review: This is an average movie about 2 best friends who both love the same girl and fight to prove who is worthy of her love. One is a famous bull fighter, who really wants to be a musician and the other is a highly decorated soldier who protects his village from evil. There are some other elements to the storyline which makes it quite interesting but the animation looked weird, especially the characters with the weird noses which looked more like snouts. Personally, I think that the storyline is a bit too confusing for kids and the songs weren't that great. I did enjoy all of the scenes with Ice Cube but most of the movie was corny and it seemed a bit messy. On the plus side, the kids will like the vibrant colours and the love story between Manolo and Maria but I was expecting more from this film. Average!Round-Up: Although I didn't think that this movie was that great, it did make a healthy profit at the box office, mainly because it's a fun day out for the family. I couldn't really tell who was Chaning Tatum but Ice Cube and Ron Perlman was blatantly obvious. The animation looked a bit blocky but the attention to detail was quite impressive. As the film had a Mexican flavour, I think the director missed the chance to have a great soundtrack. Anyway, it's not an all time classic like Frozen, which did rely a lot on the soundtrack, but it's harmless fun for the whole family. Budget: $50million Worldwide Gross: $97.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation movies about 2 best friends who are fighting against each other to impress there true love. 4/10",negative
The Book of Life,"First lets; clarify; I am not Mexican nor any in my family and friend group; however it has been a long long time since we catch kids movie able to captivate 5,6,7 or 8 year old girls and boy and the parents that took them. Just the quality, colors and artistry of the images; makes the movie worth; but the subject matter is even more impressive. How many times you were able to really laugh on a subject matter like death and make children (and adults) happy with an adventure that is pure entertainment but also gives a quite poetic look at life and dead. In brief; take your children to see it as an excuse; you probably will enjoy it even more. Forget PIXAR formula products; this is just a masterpiece",positive
Into the Storm,"It is uncomfortable to say, because I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, but this is a really awful movie. First, the trailers were very misleading. This flick is a limp 4th or 5th generation duplicate of ""Twister"" (1996; and an exciting and excellent weather adventure, with future Oscar winners Helen Hunt and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, as well as Cary Elwes and Alan Ruck, for example, and Bill Paxton recently Sargent Farrell from ""Edge of Tomorrow"" - all showing up with excellent actor skills, loads of charisma and talent). ""Into the Storm"" was NOTHING even remotely close to a finished, professional movie, let alone ""Twister."" Second: The ""acting"" was so bad it would look bad even if it was on a YouTube skit. I won't go into line-by-line analysis, and instead will just say it is wooden, emotionless, and so unconvincing I had to remind myself they were actors in the same movie - ANY movie.The only way the acting could have been more dead and flat is if the actors held their Xeroxed copies of their scripts and read the lines verbatim.Saying such things about a movie that maybe many people worked very hard to create and produce is not a good feeling. I promise, I am not trying to be mean-spirited, but you need to know what you are in for BEFORE you hire a baby sitter, make evening plans, and plunk down $40 for parking, a couple of tickets, and popcorn and drinks.The actors are probably genuinely great and wonderful humans in whatever careers they have chosen... but please, please, PLEASE make that not acting.BTW- The special effects were very good - maybe spectacular. The model building and FX shots were actually top-notch. Too bad the script was so lame, it could not make all that good looking disaster seem interesting.",negative
Into the Storm,"I will have to admit, this movie scared the hell out of me. I have not been able to say that in many, many years. It was an awesome, frightening, very realistic movie.Need to add, there were some points where I nearly cried as well, when things got really bad.A couple of the scenes where very heartfelt, and a single, hasty choice turned into the memory of a lifetime.Completely unexpected events take place, things you never would have thought up. Strangers brought together, and a happy ending where I thought there would be a tragedy.I will mention that I have not gotten scared by a movie in most of my life, but this movie scared the living Hades out of me, and I was so glad my bf was there because I got to snuggle close and hold on to him. I did not expect the movie to be so intense, and life-like, but you will never know until you see it, how realistic it is.",positive
Teen Titans GO! To the Movies,"If you're looking for a fun time at the movies and don't want a plot quite as intense as mission impossible, I suggest you check this out. The irreverent humor and many references will keep even the most avid cynic of this show intrigued.
What this movie has that too many adult comedies lack is a heart. I was genuinely surprised that I actually cared about Robin's ups and downs throughout the movie due to the surprisingly well-written story. Yes, the movie has the occasional fart joke, but it's not overdone. In fact, the movie is quite aware that those types of jokes aren't for everyone, so it often utilizes them to make fun of itself.
It is at times a little predictable, but it has enough going for it that makes the story thematically consistent. It even references it's own cliches and predictableness in a funny way.
My only main complaint is the pacing. I think the main reason for this is that the story appears to have its conflict resolve, and it takes awhile for the story to pick up steam again.
Comedies can often get overly cynical, but this movie looks to appeal to the heart of the fanboy and dreamer in all of us and accomplishes it. Even if you don't like the movie, I suggest you stick around for the end credits scene because it's got something older fans can get excited for.",negative

Epic,"Interesting to call this movie ""Epic"" because while it is cute and the animation is good, it didn't strike me as epic. Brave was more of an epic story, but I digress.I enjoyed watching it on the big screen (but then I enjoy watching all movies on the big screen). The one thing that stood out like a very sore thumb was the awful voice casting of Beyonce. This woman may be able to sing and dance but, for me, her voice for the queen part actually took away from the movie. Why? Because I was hearing Beyonce talking and not the character. For the most part, she had no proper emotion in her tone and it appeared silly to me. When you are doing a voice-over for an animated character, you need to speak differently than you usually do or it sounds silly. I was so glad when the queen was snuffed out early on. The other character voices were right on because I didn't hear the actor as much as I heard and saw the character. That's the sign of a good voice-over, imo.As far as the storyline goes, it was pretty good and the ending queen choice was neat, especially since the little ""girl"" had asked if she could be queen. I liked that. Loved the snail and slug, some of their lines were very funny. AND some of their lines could be missed if you were not paying close attention.So, based on my review of Gatsby, I have to say again...stop giving into the big music money and leave Beyonce, et al, to the music industry...please. OR teach them how not to be so distracting in a movie.",negative
Epic,"This is without a doubt the most fantastic visual animation I've ever seen. It brought to mind i) nature scenes on Pandora in ""Avatar"", ii) lush vegetation jungle scenes from ""Up!"", iii) the whole valley turning green at the end of ""Princess Mononoke"", and iv) the infinitely graded colors in ""Oz the Great and Powerful"". (I watched it in 2D, and don't know what 3D is like.)But visually it outstrips all of those. The plants are real ones we're familiar with (not imagined ones); scenes are incredibly detailed (not one fern but tens of them, not one blossom but hundreds); biological growth and decay is of individual plants seen up close (not a very long shot across a whole valley); and all the vibrant yet subtle colors appear in nature (not a fantasy world). Vegetation unfurls and extends as we watch, and it all seems perfectly realistic and believable. We see the whole process of burls developing on live trees in just a few seconds over and over. We see growth meristems probing for the best direction and expanding little by little. And we see the slight shifts in color that signal the beginning of more decay or more growth.All the animation effects technology has already conquered --fur, musculature, waves, droplets, rain, crowds, flying, moving cameras, etc. etc.-- are also deployed virtuosic-ally in the places the storyline calls for them. From my aged (about 60) perspective, it seems suitable and enjoyable for all ages (although it's rated PG) ...and not because adults will see a different film as they understand the more salacious meaning of double entendres - there aren't any. There isn't any notable music nor abstract visual patterns nor references to fairy tales either, other things frequently associated with animations.The story is decent too. It's a seamless melding of realities (such as a brusque taxi driver) with fantasy (tiny beings riding hummingbirds?). It proceeds organically, eventually incorporating pretty much everything that happened earlier (even things that appeared to be already completed or even unrelated). The typical joke is mostly visual, developing slowly over many seconds - no one-liners here. There are not a lot of the ironic jokes that have been prominent in many recent animations. (In fact this movie is often relegated to ""kids film"" or ""family film"", which makes me feel a little silly for enjoying it.) The ending is positive but not saccharine -- there's resolution ...but not of everything.Comic relief is provided by a tag team of a snail and a slug. A typical gag is something about ""eyes inside your head"" or ""everybody hide in your shell"" (slugs of course don't have shells). I found it adequately funny (but not laugh out loud funny). Humor is a very personal thing though, and I suspect some of the more ""with it"" young adults will find it painfully unfunny. The flights, the fights, the falls are gripping. This is edge of your seat stuff. And the tiny perspective casts familiar things in a new light: a mouse becomes a threatening giant, and a looming doggie kiss would mean serious injury or even death. Pick a theater with a really big screen and a newish projector, and sit toward the front. And if you're an animation aficionado plan to attend more than once. Also, sit through the end credits, as the level of detail and imagination in the background visuals --often throwaways or repeats, but not here-- is astounding.",positive
The Girl with All the Gifts,"I know many of you reading this probably won't care, because of the praise this movie is getting, but this is one of the most blatant rip offs I have seen in recent memory.Let me recap: The story involves a post apocalyptic setting where a strain of Cordyceps fungus has mutated. Infecting most of the population, turning them into violent mutated zombie like humans who attack and eat anyone and anything. The fungus is transmitted through bites, but the longer humans are infected they can begin to spread the disease by becoming immobile and beginning sprouting pods that shoot spores into the air, spreading the fungi even more. But years after the infection begins we find a girl. A special girl who is immune to the effects of the fungus. A group searching for a cure learns of the girl and wants to bring her to a center/base to use her to create the cure. She has a protector that starts off looking after her as just a job, but begins to care for her. But then her protector learns that creating the cure with the help of this special girl involves killing her. Now they have to decide if they can live with sacrificing her to save the world. And now you have the full plot of The Last of Us. A critically acclaimed and award winning video game that came out in the summer of 2013. A full YEAR before the book was even published. Could this be a coincidence? Sure. Maybe. But come on...This gets a 1 star for being a complete rip off and doing it worse than the video game. If it wasn't a rip off it would be an OK movie at best.",negative
The Girl with All the Gifts,"I remember once having a ridiculous drunken dispute at a works Christmas party many year's ago that went along the lines of ""if you had the chance to save the world, but had to kill your child to do it, what would you do"". There's a variant of this conundrum at the heart of this brilliant new film from Colm McCarthy, best know for his TV work on shows like ""Peaky Blinders"", ""Sherlock"" and ""Dr Who"".As most people already realize, this is a 'Zombie film' (cue, a number of other single blokes in the cinema) and illustrates the dangers of not treating that Athlete's Foot as soon as it appears! I would normally provide a quick synopsis here, but I really think this is a case in point where it is best to go into the film as blind as possible to the story and let it envelop you. (This includes not watching the whole trailer if possible.) To merely set the scene, we open with a morning school ritual like none you've seen before: children strapped to wheelchairs by heavily armed military in their cells; wheeled to an underground classroom; then made to sit in serried rows being taught by their teacher Helen Justineau (a deliciously un-made-up and natural Gemma Arterton). What IS going on? Who ARE these children? WHY are the soldiers so scared and dismissive of them? The ever-great Paddy Considine (""Pride"") plays army Sergeant Parks (who also has a bit of a crush on Helen) and Glenn Close plays Dr Caroline Caldwell, who is studying the children in more ways than one.This trio of stars, supported notably later in the film by Fisayo Akinade as the trooper Kieran, turn in what is a superb ensemble performance. As for Glenn Close, I have never quite been able to shake her awful ""silk blouse"" performance in ""Air Force One"" from my mind, but here she is quite mesmerizing in the role of the Doctor on a mission: I would suggest a career best. Her final scene reflects such a complex range of emotions, and is brilliantly executed. And Gemma Arterton pulls out all the emotional stops in what is also one of the performances of the year.But good as these performances are, they would be nothing without the central performance of young Sennia Nanua as the titular ""Girl"". I have made the point before that there should be an Oscar category for ""Young Actors"" rather than pitch them into the adult categories like Quvenzhane Wallis and Anna Paquin were (successfully). Here in her debut feature performance Sennia is just mesmerising and (provided this film gets the recognition it justly deserves) she should be a shoe-in for the BAFTA Rising Star award next year, if not an Actress nomination. A young lady most definitely to watch.Also assuming a starring role is Chilean-born composer Cristobal Tapia de Veer's astonishingly effective music which drives up the tension superbly. This is his feature film debut and another name to watch.The screenplay by Mike Carey from his original novel is beautifully crafted, with some great one liners dropped in to ease the tension a notch. And the story adds a level of emotional depth and angst that surpasses other films of this genre, at least as far back as the ""28 Days"" films.Astonishingly, the film was made on a budget of 4 (FOUR!) Million Pounds, giving it a 'BvS quotient' (see bob-the-movie-man.com!) of 2.1%!! Every penny of that budget is up on the screen, and whilst you might like to pick at a few of the matte paintings and effects, it is a remarkably achievement in special effects (Nick Rideout is the SF supervisor) and production value.So, its great! Go see it... but with a few caveats: it is a zombie film, and it ranks about an 8.9 on the splattometer scale, which might not be to some tastes; definitely don't go to see it if you are pregnant (though I am constantly reminded how I took my heavily pregnant wife in 1989 to see ""A really great film called 'Alien'""); and you might want to avoid it if you are a great cat or dog lover, or indeed a pigeon-fancier. Other than that, get yourself down to a multiplex and see this great British film: surely a classic to be recognized for years to come.(You can read the full graphical version of this review on bob-the-movie-man.com.

47 Meters Down,"One of the first things taught in film school is if you can show the audience, don't tell them. That is why most voice overs are not necessary and exposition scenes bring most films to a screeching halt. 47 Meters Down commits the sin of not only showing us things, but having characters make sure we know what we are seeing by repeating what is being shown. Case in point: One character is swimming along the ocean floor and spots a spear gun. It is obviously a spear gun. Only an idiot would not know this is a spear gun. The character then feels the need to say, ""There is a spear gun."" This happens throughout the film. The air tank reads low, ""I am almost out of air."" A giant shark swims by, ""Look there is a shark."" When this film comes out on video, it would make a great drinking game. Whenever someone repeats what is shown on screen, take a shot. No one will be conscious by the end of the film. Skip this movie. It is awful.",negative

Don't worry I won't spoil the movie for those that haven't seen it. All I can say is this movie is defiantly worth a watch. Kudos to the director for making the scenes so intense and edge of your seat. Also the tones of the movie were perfectly set and gave you chills.

Seriously, it's such a minor part of the movie, laugh, don't laugh, and move on. The movie has many good messages: knowing when to fess up and admit you did wrong (imagine that! Accountability!), making apologies (woah, again with owning up to your actions!), the impotance of friends and family, and more! Also, a great cast and a fabulous soundtrack.",positive
Missing Link,"There are so many cliches to the movie that it makes this less of a Laika film and more of a Dreamworks Animation film. Add in the cloying disneyfied story with little tension and predictability and you get Missing Link, one of the weaker Laika films. I mean, this film has nothing special worth mentioning about it, even Laika's weakest film ""The Boxtrolls"" had more quirky elements and suspense to it. There is not much suspense in this one because one, I didn't care for the characters and two, the ending is anticlimatic, and three, there's not enough heart and soul to be found here. None of the humor I found that funny, I might have chuckled at one joke but that's about it. It's aimed particularly at children and a lot of the humor is either just lowbrow humor for the 9 year olds would get a kick out of or gags that you've seen in other kids cartoons.There is no chemistry between the characters like for example, the forced romantic subplot between Zoe Saldana's character who I forgot the name of and Sir Lionel. The romance angle and her character alone was so contrived, like Zoe Saldona's character joins the adventure after Link and Sir Lionel robbed her house. Who would want to hang out with some stranger who broke into your house? Worse yet, they force in a romantic subplot between her and Lionel which doesn't make sense, why does she like this guy so much? This is the same jerk who broke into her house with some weird-looking monster, I don't get her whole weak character and her development. She is such an annoying character so it makes the film more intolerable to watch.Throughout watching this film, I couldn't help but feel like it was missing something. Maybe it was missing the heart and soul that usually filled Laika films. For all intent and purposes, if you're looking for a nice animated buddy movie with some heart, you're better off watching Smallfoot, it's a bit different from this film and it's nothing groundbreaking neither but it has slightly more chemistry between characters and more heart to it. I don't believe a kid over the age of 9 would enjoy this. The only good thing about this film was a few of the action scenes and the animation, I cannot deny the animation is gorgeous as usual with Laika's films but that's the only points I can give it. I have no more to say about Missing Link. From its characters to its story, the writing was just meh, it's not horrible but it's not breathtakingly-good. I know I keep mentioning Laika's other films like Coraline and Paranorman but maybe I'm missing the darkness from those films because that's what I come to expect from Laika films.

Laika are an animation studio who use stop-motion animation such as how Aardman Animations use it in the same style for Wallace & Gromit.There are some very famous voices in this new film. Hugh Jackman provides the voice for Sir Lionel Frost. Zoe Saldana provides the voice for a character called Adelina Fortnight, a free-spirited woman who is well able to look after herself. Then it is Zach Galifianakis who plays the innocent Sasquatch, Mr. Link, who wants to travel across the world with Sir Lionel Frost to find any other creatures similar to himself. There are also plenty of other famous voices to be heard, such as Stephen Fry, Emma Thompson, Amrita Acharia, Timothy Olyphant, Matt Lucas and David Walliams.Missing Link is a wonderfully beautiful film. It reminds me of a really exciting adventure film which feels like a mix of Indiana Jones, Sherlock Holmes and elements from a Western. Even though those influences are there, the film manages to do its own thing. It's written so well and the dialogue between the characters is hilarious. The film also looks amazing. Laika have a certain skill and technique which is ever so creative for this form of art. The film is so good that you forget that you're listening to Hugh Jackman or any of the other actors. You're under a spell watching the film and the entire spectacle of it all sweeps you away.One of the best and most original films I have ever seen. It doesn't matter what age you are, anybody will enjoy this wonderful film! 🙂 10/10",positive
Zoolander 2,"i loved Zoolander, thought it was witty and funny, but Zoolander 2 was just rubbish. its just like Owen Wilson and Ben stiller decided to top up there bank balances with this unfunny boring movie.i lost an hour and a half of my life which ill never get back,i would have rather sat in a dentist chair getting my teeth pulled out. Same old jokes nothing original it relied too much on cameo appearances.its a shame because i was looking forward to this movie for the past 15 years. its just like Wilson and stiller didn't have any chemistry together,I've seen some horrible comedies in my life and i can honestly say this was the worst I've ever seen. all i hope is they don't go and make a third one.

Zoolander 2,"I am going to just say, Derek Zoolander & Hansel's first movie was dynamite stuff, really classic and really quite funny. It was always a cool time to pop in my VHS tape with some popcorn and stuff. So when I saw that they had made the second sequel movie film to the first movie that was made, you can bet I was super excited and pumped for it.Well, rightly so, what a film movie! It was perfect. It wasn't recycled at all, it was still just Derek and Hansel being really cool guys and stuff. I was sorry to hear about Derek and his stuff that he had going on, I didn't know it was such a rough time off the runway and stuff, you know, but thats real life, it can sometimes be not the place you ever want to end up ever. It can make you die. So anyway, the scripting was fantastic, and the plot was just great. The cameos were all just fabulously wonderful and absolutely sexy. rawr, folks.All in all, I adored it. And I'm fantastically happy no one else does, because I can have it all to myself, just like the first one. Hah. Suck on that, critics. You just don't get the grown up's humor. Humph.

Pete's Dragon,"Very flawed film. I can not even say it was cute. It really wasn't. The original was not perfect but certainly better than this rendition. I agree that dragons do not have fur. Yes, it would have been better titled as , Pete's Very Big Dog. I did not enjoy this film. I am sure adults like it because why I do not know. I love Redford but not in this film. Slow, Un-entertaining and bland. I see where they are trying to go with the sentimental folksie vibe. Maybe if more of Mumford and Sons were on the track. Nah, it was not a good Re-Make at all. Junglebook.....remake.....AWESOME!!!",negative
Pete's Dragon,"Liked this a lot. I was 4 when I first saw Pete's dragon way back in '83 or whatever back in England. I remember how much I loved the idea of Pete's dragon. I watched the original a few years back and realized that it was a fairly average musical with an animated dragon. But still!!!! I remember how great the story or idea of a personal dragon was. The modern spin is very sentimental, but never cheesy. Everything was great; from casting to special effects. I really enjoyed this movie. If you remember the old Pete's dragon from back when you were a skid, you'll love this movie. To be completely honest, there were several tear jerker moments. I guess they really nailed down the aspects of a child becoming suddenly orphaned. They also did a really good job if propelling the story so that it never sat idle. Robert Redford played the integral old timer part, but played it exceptionally well as to be expected. It is also relevant to mention that I typically do not review movies I have just seen immediately after I have seen them. This film made an exception for me.",positive
The Command,"First, The sinking was in August 2000.
The Russian subs used at the Titanic which is referenced in this movie during the failed rescue scene never occurred in that year. They loaned them to James Cameron for his Ghosts of the Abyss from August to Sept in 2001, 1 year after the Kursk sinking. Did anyone research this or just tossed in this inaccuracy for more filler?",negative
The Command,"This is a fictionalization of the Russian submarine disaster that made world-wide news. Adapted from a book, the story runs in multiple alternating stories. Matthias Schoenaerts stars as the submarine officer who has to keep the survivors alive. Léa Seydoux co-stars as his wife, battling for information from the naval authorities who are stonewalling. Colin Firth has a bit part as a British officer, representing the international offers for help. Meanwhile, the severely underfunded Russian navy has only one ill-maintained rescue vessel, and, for political or other reasons, is resisting offers to help from various NATO countries.The underwater scenes were suitably claustrophobic. While different (sometimes under-trained) crew members exhibited different reactions, there was general camaraderie, as also shown in an early sequence where various underpaid crew members sell their watches to help finance a colleague's wedding.A significant bit part is the young son of Matthias Schoenaerts' character, who opens the movie practicing holding his breath underwater - a skill needed for future naval / submarine work. The kid represents the children of the whole crew.I saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival, and was surprised to see that Kursk was in English. The director reasoned that he didn't speak Russian, and the film was about various communities coming together, something that was more universal than it being just a Russian story.Note that I am reviewing this as a movie, not as to whether this is a complete historical document.",positive
Snatched,"It's really unfortunate that Goldie Hawn was in this movie, because she's genuinely capable of doing great work.Schumer on the other hand has never really been funny, and has been recycling the same tired vagina jokes for what seems to be an eternity.The mother-daughter duo have horrible writing, it's difficult to really relate to them (which is a problem with a lot of Schumer's stand-up - she says a lot of unrelatable things) and I had a very hard time liking or even finding the characters interesting.At some point Hollywood is going to realise that the quickest way to kill a movie is to include Schumer, who is rapidly becoming a poison pill in the industry. That time can't come fast enough.",negative
Snatched,"Aawwhhh, look - all the members of the 'I hate Amy Schumer' club got together and decided to each give her film 1 star! The majority of the negative reviews are barely a couple of lines, mostly just a list of negative adjectives that do not constitute a 'review'. It's strange how someone can think a film so utterly terrible and yet struggle to elaborate at all on why - it's almost as if they haven't actually seen the movie (mock gasp of shock!). So, in case anyone is interested, here is an actual review of a film I actually saw last night called 'Snatched'.You'll most likely know the basic premise - Schumer and Hawn are a mother daughter duo who go on holiday and get kidnapped - madcap adventure ensues. I went to see this movie thinking, a bit of harmless,light-hearted, funny escapism - and that's exactly what I got. Is it going to win any Oscars...? Of course not! It's a slapstick comedy! But it delivered exactly what it promised. Schumer and Hawn's chemistry is brilliant, two incredibly talented comedy actors coming together was magical. The storyline is both weak and implausible - again, it's a slapstick comedy, who on earth is expecting realism here!? The great thing about it is that it doesn't take itself seriously at all! It doesn't try to be something it's not which is so refreshing in a comedy. It's a very well paced 90 minutes so there's no pointless padding out you see so often with comedies desperately trying to stretch out a movie, believing quantity is better than quality. Some of the characters are so tongue in cheek that the film borders on being a spoof - but this only adds an extra dimension to the humour and you just have to roll with it.I loved seeing an average, curvy woman confidently wearing a bikini in a Hollywood movie. It seems there's either anorexic 'serious' female leads or obese 'comedy' leads - neither of which (sorry Melissa Mccarthy!) promote a healthy body image. I just feel sad that it has to get a special mention - it should be so commonplace that it's unremarkable, but it isn't.I've tried to avoid giving any spoilers in this review, but just to prove I really have seen this movie and genuinely LOVED it - here are a few of my favourite bits hopefully described in a way that doesn't give away too much - the guy with the boat's back story, delivery and overall character, Joan Cusack popping up - another 'unconventional' Hollywood lady, the totally relatable, over- protective mothering scenes (actually this was the context of the whole film and the main reason I loved it!), Emily 'freshening up', Emily learning a new 'dance', the relationship between Emily and her grown-up, still living at home brother, Emily's encounter with the doctor...In the future I will be mindful of extremely negative reviews and discount ones that are clearly part of a hate campaign by people who haven't seen the movie in question.",positive

Kubo and the Two Strings,"Can someone please tell me what this film was about? The visuals were great and the actors also but the end of the movie had me scratching my head. It left me feeling ultimately unfulfilled. How is it that the evil and all powerful grandfather turns into a meek half blind feeble old man with no memory? Where did his 2 aunts go? And why were they wearing masks the whole time? Something must have actually happened as his parents did die so this story was not just a fantasy the boy was having about his cranky grandfather. Why did his grandfather remove the boy's eye and want to take the other one too? My friend and I just looked at each other when the film was over, not sure what to think. We had gone through a beautiful adventure, one that ultimately did not make sense to either one of us. Had I known that this film was 99% about art and 1% about plot, I know I would not have gone.",negative
Kubo and the Two Strings,"""Kubo and the Two Strings"" is a hard movie to explain. There is a story in it and the adventure is grand and fun, but I can't place it into a category of traditional storytelling. The themes of the film are the values of memories and how we truly can never forget people that we lose throughout our lifetime. Very mature themes that are handled with such finesse and creativity that I can't say I have seen anything like it before. Even when you as the audience know where the story is headed, the film surprises you with the delivery and you actually grow and learn with the characters. The strength of the film is the pure visceral experience it provides. The visuals and sound had a layer of depth and drama that you feel in your inner core. It is more of an experience than it is a movie that you watch. Throughout the film, I felt moments of sadness, loss, happiness, horror, fear, and accomplishment. It is a movie that truly raises the bar for animation and it saddens me that many people will not check it out as it is very different from traditional animated films that we are used to seeing from other major animation studios. So much care and attention went into this film. The world Laika has created is rich with so much history, story, mythos, and culture that even some movies and series that are much longer can't fully create. I felt that the world is living and that magic is truly alive. I love how the character make it feel special that magic exists, but aren't put of by it, when they see it for themselves and have to question the logic.The characters are fun and lovable, but also brave and dimensional. Not one character felt out of place and they're inclusion felt important. The voice casting is top-notch and I felt like the celebrities actually made an effort. Unlike many big-budget animated productions, The voice actors weren't distracting and added their own layer of charisma that enhanced and drew attention to the characters. Monkey is probably the best character and I feel like she'll be the fan favorite as she's funny, powerful, and a total bada**.Overall, Laika has produced probably their best animated film to date and that is saying a lot from a studio that produces quality efforts time and time again. ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" is unlike anything out there and deserves to be seen on the big screen. The animation alone is breathtakingly gorgeous. The beautiful score and music only adds to the complexity of the film. It is probably the best film of 2016 so far and I find it hard to beat. I highly recommend that people check out this highly creative experience.",positive
The Walk,"The Walk (2015) *** (out of 4) The incredible true story of high-wire walker Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who got to live his dream of crossing the Twin Towers in 1974.THE WALK was first brought to the screen in the Oscar-winning documentary MAN ON WIRE but obviously director Robert Zemeckis saw something in the story that made him want to turn it into a feature. THE WALK was released to Luke warm reviews and it ended up dying a rather painful death at the box office but I'm going to guess that it won't be forgotten but instead fine a good cult audience somewhere down the road.The story itself is something of complete wonder and there's no question that the documentary did a much better job at telling it. With that said, even thought the documentary is the better of the two films, this feature still offers up some impressive visuals and performances that makes it worth seeing. I didn't get to see the film in 3D so I can't comment on that but I thought Zemeckis did a wonderful job at making the viewer see and feel how high up Petit was.The scenes certainly have a very claustrophobic feel to them and you can't help but panic yourself just wondering what you would do in a situation like that. Just reading or hearing about the story will make you wonder how a human could do it but this film gives you a great feel and idea of the terror that it would cause in most people. Gordon-Levitt gives a very good performance in the role of Petit and I especially liked how the movie didn't back down from him at times not being so likable. I thought the actor did a remarkable job getting into the role and you had no problem believing that he was the real guy.THE WALK does contain some flaws and that includes it running on a bit too much. Everyone going into the movie knows the story so there's a rush to get to the actual walk in the movie. I thought the early stuff dragged on a bit too much and I think some editing probably would have helped things. However, once we actually get to the walk itself there's no question that the magic takes over and that alone makes the film worth sitting through.",negative
The Walk,"Robert Zemeckis continue's to be of the best director's in Hollywood. He has made a beautiful movie and even though you know what happens, he keeps you gripping your armrests and holding your breath until the very end. Joseph Gordon-Levitt shines in this role along with the rest of the cast.I suppose this review is also for the people who were in New York during 9/11. As a survivor of 9/11, I couldn't help but cry at the end of the movie. Seeing the Twin Towers rising in all their glory, basking in the sunset and reminding us of their beauty that so many of us took for granted, brought back so many emotions for me. They were like old friends saying hello and goodbye one last time.Thank you Zemeckis for telling a great story, making a beautiful movie and bringing back old friends to life!If possible, go see it in IMAX! You won't regret it!",positive
Song of the Sea,"This movie is not just good, it's amazing! Magical! The directors have done a great job, it's full of art.. did not even made me feel im watching a 2D movie even for a second. Enjoyed every second of it. Loved this :)",negative
Song of the Sea,"I guess the title kind of gives it away, doesn't it? Still, I'm not one who's given to hyperbole when describing movies, and I'm enough of a critic that I want to nitpick to insane degrees from time to time, but I just can't do it with Song of the Sea. There's just nothing to point out.This movie is from the same studio that brought us The Secret of Kells (2009), an almost beguilingly charming movie that brought together elements of Druidic myth, passionate Christian faith, history, and Celtic grandeur in a way that I don't think anyone had ever really seen before. When a studio with such a good first effort under their belt takes five years to come out with a second film, you can bet that it's because they're doing something magical.The only real comparison that's able to be drawn is to the work of Hayao Miyazaki, simply because there's not another animated filmmaker out there who's as honest and earnest with their culture's folklore to compare to. Where Miyazaki-san's work is steeped in spiritual fantasy and a love for his home country not really seen since the Romantic movement, Tomm Moore is a bit more grounded in Western storytelling and keeps his myths well interacted with daily life. His stories are a whimsical blend of magic and the mundane, and it's all carried so well that you wish it could all be true.The story of Saoirse and her brother Ben is cut from the classic Hero's Journey so closely that you can practically see Joseph Campbell's fingerprints on the screen. In the back of my mind, I was pointing out each and every plot point as it went by, like an eager sightseer out the side of a tour bus. While the story is formulaic, sure, it's executed brilliantly and engagingly. As we so often forget; Tropes Are Not Bad. It's fantastic to see the tools of storytelling so perfectly implemented. It's like watching a master painter or musician craft their art.Speaking of which, Song of the Sea doesn't lack for anything in the artistic departments. The visuals are jaw-droppingly beautiful, simplistic in design, true to the Celtic roots of the story, and should almost be listed as a character in and of themselves. This story simply couldn't have been told as well with a different art crew, the dynamic is so tied into the feel and flow of the tale. The score is, similarly, simplistic and heartfelt. It doesn't overshadow anything. There's no bombast or leitmotif to be found, but the music is so integral to the plot that you can't imagine the movie without it. Or not even with more of it, the balance is so fine.And to cap it all off, the voice acting is absolutely brilliant. This is what I long to hear, a return to the days when people were matched to roles that they could play, not a parade of Hollywood ""talent"" who tries to buy viewers with recognition and star power. Song of the Sea is loaded with people who can actually ACT in their voices alone, and from the adults straight down to the child actors who play the roles of the protagonist pair, every one is a standout.Honestly, I haven't seen an animated film this heartfelt and earnest since The Lion King, which is probably one of the last times that a studio really just threw their cards on the table and said ""let's see what we can really do to tell a story"". Song of the Sea hasn't and won't gross well at the box office by Hollywood standards - which is a true shame, because I can't think of a film from 2014 that more deserves to be seen.",positive
IO,"I forced myself to finish this movie in order to feel okay about writing a review; however, I really wanted to step away after the first major factual inaccuracies presented themselves in the first 5 minutes. As an environmental engineer, I feel more than qualified to comment on these inaccuracies. I'll outline several of them from throughout the movie for you here:1) ""... to harvest geothermal energy from other planets."" (00:01:20)
The prefix ""geo"" is defined as ""relating to the Earth""; therefore, ""geothermal energy"" refers exclusively to thermal energy from the Earth. You cannot ""harvest geothermal energy from other planets"" anymore than you can harvest solar energy from a lightbulb.2) ""Sample 181B. Drawn from the sediment strata, should confirm or disconfirm the presence of bacterium able to use ammonium as a main oxygen source."" (00:04:46)
This quote contains two errors, so I will refer to them as ""2a"" and ""2b"".
2a) Ammonium consists of only Nitrogen and Hydrogen, so it could never be a ""main oxygen source"". In the unlikely case that by ""ammonium"" the writers were implying ""ammonium oxide"", it would be within the realms of a science fiction piece to make this claim. However, the fact that this is an isolated use of the term ""ammonium"" in the movie (the writers prefer ""ammonia"" in every other case, which actually is a different chemical compound), along with a later inaccuracy I will address, make the loose inference of ""ammonium"" to ""ammonium oxide"" very unlikely. What's more is that it is not a new concept that bacteria exist which can respire in such conditions. In fact, we have known that they exist for a long time and rely on them in many ways. I will mention this later on as well.
2b) In this quote, the singular ""bacterium"" is used in the plural sense. It's interesting that the writers were even familiar with the singular form when ""bacteria"" is colloquially used in the singular sense, and ""bacterium"" is almost exclusive to scientific literature and dialogue where it is always used in reference to a single bacterium or singular strain of bacteria. Later in the movie, another character makes the opposite but more forgivable mistake when he says, ""Was it a bacteria?"" (01:15:46)3) ""Anaerobic reproduction in a water-striding insect colony."" (00:08:56)
To my knowledge, there is no such phenomenon referred to as ""anaerobic reproduction"". That is not to say that this is impossible or does not exist. Let me explain. Anaerobic simply refers to processes which occur in the absence of a common electron accepter (e.g., nitrate, sulfate, or oxygen). Many organisms, such as anaerobic bacteria, do in fact reproduce in these conditions. However, this is not referred to as ""anaerobic reproduction"" because neither anaerobic nor aerobic conditions lend themselves to a specific type of reproduction. More than likely, the writers actually meant ""anaerobic respiration"". This makes sense in light of the ""scientific"" premise of the movie, which is the struggle of life on earth to adapt to an atmosphere contaminated with ammonia and implicitly low oxygen. The reference to anaerobic conditions also discredits the notion that the writers implied ""ammonium oxide"" when using the term ""ammonium"".4) ""We filter our drinking water through sand and charcoal. It's all it needs."" (00:26:55)
Assuming the water is contaminated with ammonia (like the air), sand and charcoal would do nothing to purify it. In wastewater treatment, where ammonia removal is a necessary process, nitrifying bacteria are used to nitrify ammonia. That is, they ultimately convert the ammonia to nitrate, hydrogen and water. This is a very complicated, multi-step process that involves balancing pH, dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen demand to achieve the desired effect. Had the writers suggested that Sam harvested nitrifying bacteria (likely quite common on an ammonia-rich Earth) and used them to treat her water, this would have been within the realms of a science fiction piece. But sand and charcoal would do nothing for ammonia.5) ""It's only cloudy like that because of the charcoal."" (00:26:49)
Charcoal filtration removes particles from contaminated water through adsorption. Most household filters use activated charcoal to improve the aesthetic qualities of their water (look, taste and smell). Implying that the charcoal would actually discolor the water is a major inaccuracy, since it would in fact do the opposite. Now, if the process actually added charcoal to the water instead of filtering the water through the charcoal, this would discolor it, but it would do nothing to filter the water. However, I doubt that is the implication when the ""treated"" water has a light brown hue. Charcoal would have turned the water gray or black, depending on the amount added.6) ""You'd think they could live up high like us."" (00:30:27)
This quote implies that the surviving humans were able to escape the contaminated air by living at a higher elevation. However, ammonia is lighter than air, meaning the ammonia concentration would likely be higher at an increased elevation, not lower.7) Throughout the movie, Sam regularly monitors the air quality by sustaining a flame and observing its color. In the movie, a purple flame is supposed to represent contaminated air, whereas a yellow/orange flame represents clean air. When ammonia burns in the presence of oxygen, the flame is actually yellow, not purple. But let's look at this a little deeper. Ammonia has a flammable range of 15 - 28%. This means that ammonia will not ignite at a concentration of less than 15% volume of air or a concentration higher than 28% volume of air. According to the CDC, ammonia is ""immediately dangerous to life or health"" at just 300 ppm, which is just 0.03% volume of air. A concentration of 15% (150,000 ppm) or higher would not just be damaging to the eyes, nostrils and lungs, but also to the skin. The character would need to wear a fully-enclosed, airtight suit to protect herself against harm.I understand that science fiction writers are not scientists, but the premise behind science fiction is to provide a somewhat plausible scenario that is at least loosely based on some scientific truth. Even fantasy pieces, which delve into realms far beyond the scope of even pseudoscience, do not attempt to rewrite or misrepresent well-known, established scientific fact without some sort of explanation (even if it's something as ludicrous as dolphins that suddenly bound from the ocean into deep space because of their sentience and connections to other-worldly beings).It's quite disappointing to think that so much money and effort could be put into a movie on the part of writers, producers, actors, videographers, and visual effects specialists (to name a few) and yet they didn't think to have somebody with at least the qualifications of a middle school science teacher read over the screenplay.",negative
IO,"I really enjoyed the slow pace and contemplative mood of this movie.

Mortdecai,"I just got back from seeing this and it's honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I knew it wasn't going to be brilliant, but I like Johnny Depp and thought it would be at least a fun, bumbling action-comedy, a genre that is a 'guilty pleasure' of mine. It's hard to decide where to start when pointing out the flaws of a dreadful movie like this, but I'll first start by saying that the writing is horrendous. The lazy writers decided to use the same jokes not once, not twice, but several times because they can't think of anything better to write! The line 'show me your balls' is used at least 3-5 times and while it was sort of funny the first time, it starts to get INCREDIBLY tedious and repetitive after that. The same goes with Mortdecai's wife gagging when they try to kiss. That happens 3-5 times as well and is even the final shot of the movie as well! The rest of the humor is mostly slapstick-based, which would have been fine if it wasn't so painfully obvious what was coming. For example, in one scene Mortdecai is sword fighting a man and he ends up on the ground with a large box suspended from a wire up above. The man takes the sword and cuts the rope and the box almost 'traps' Mortdecai. And in one ridiculous scene when the writers didn't know how to end it, people attending a party with food poisoned by the villain, despite being in plain view of the villain poisoning the food, eat it and vomit profusely, including onto a moving car's windshield. The remaining jokes are painfully dumb as well and are basically showcases of the complete stupidity of Mortdecai's character. For example, he walks into a hotel in Los Angeles and sees people in bikinis and claims that he accidentally went to the set of a porno. Then he checks in at the reception desk and gets handed a room key and claims that the U.S. is in financial troubles because anyone who checks in at a hotel receives a credit card like he supposedly just did. The story is really dull and never really comes together, and even worse, the so-called twist can be guessed miles away. Overall, ""Mortdecai"" is an embarrassingly bad comedy that tries to be funny, but the horrible quality of the movie is the real joke. One of the worst movies I've ever seen!",negative
Mortdecai,"""Mortdecai"" was hilarious from start to finish. Critics have been a bit too harsh with this one. Full of cleverly-written lines, this movie is one I will continue to watch time and time again. Johnny Depp plays the Mr. Bean-type role magnificently, and the chemistry between he and Paltrow was great as well. His ""sympathetic gag reflex"" had be laughing throughout the entire movie. Johnny Depp receives quite a bit of unnecessary hate when it comes to his movie. I for one enjoy each of them. Mortdecai has now joined the ranks of Edward Scissorhands and Sweeney Todd in my list of favorites. If you enjoy goofy comedies from the likes of Mel Brooks, you will truly enjoy Mortdecai.",positive

How can he get from the middle of the sea to Sydney, and is super well equipped with numerous gadgets and even chemicals? And he has only thirty six hours to carry out his mission, and that includes travelling time? I'm not complaining about it, it's just that in a film like this, don't ever question the plot.

Jessica Alba was good and very hot. She was I think the least cheesy element and the most talented in this awful excuse of a movie!

It's cinematography is perfect, music stunning and it tells the truth without showing a side: no guerrilla or paramilitares boots. This is a conflict that has killed thousands of lives.

The Promise,"What madness is this? I just arrived from cinema and although the summer season has begun they showed me a movie which is not:  some random French or Russian comedy,  a sequel,  a prequel or at least origin story  an animation,  based on YA novel or comic book  based on a novel or non-fiction book or some older movie  there's not even any superheroes or mutants in it, ferchrissake! Set during the last days of the Ottoman Empire and their attempt to wipe out as many Armenian people as they can, at its heart there is a love story – two guys (Oscar Isaac, Christian Bale) want the same girl (Charlotte Le Bon). The Turkish government would never allow a movie like this to be filmed on their home territory – it's said that the Turks have never acknowledged the genocide or their role in it. So it was all filmed in Spain, Malta, Portugal and USA. It has a big budget of 90 million USD and that money is well spent. The movie as a whole looks old- fashioned in a good way: majestic and poetic, also a bit nostalgic for the past simpler times"". The story is also old-fashioned in a good way, which is to say the approach is populist – clearly black and white, we always know who the good and the bad guys are and nobody's choices are never questioned in broader context. But this kind of approach is not a problem when we have three leading thespians so able as Isaac, Bale and Le Bon. They put every nuance of the material to efficient use. ""The Promise"" is clearly an actors' movie and that's how it can be appreciated even if you personally do not care about that part of history. Some of the scenes with strongest dramatical impact are done even shortly and without any words, just a quick look, pause, and they move on. The Project"" never dwells long on anything happening on screen, there's so much story to give and absorb in the 132 minutes it has. And yet thanks to competent direction and superb actors, it never feels rushed, there's always enough room for important things and people in the context of the story. I especially like the action scenes which are actually pretty small in scope, compared to most war dramas produced today, but it never feel that way. The suspense and danger surrounding the main characters is always real. I am not trying to step on anyone's feelings and underplay the seriousness of the genocide, but it can be said that the century-old suffering of Armenians is not the most well-known of historical tragedies, especially to the general English-speaking audience the movie is produced for. So having a big budget that enormous seems kind of risky. Luckily for the people involved, the project was fully financed by billionaire Kirk Kerkorian of Armenian extraction whose family had lived through the events depicted in the movie, and all the proceeds will go to nonprofits (ie, charity). A fun IMDb fact to end with. The Promise"" premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival last September, but before the audience even left the theater, reviewers suspected to be Turkish government- sponsored trolls had submitted ca 4,000 negative ratings. That number quickly multiplied before the movie was released. Maybe that's why the IMDb score is pretty low, 5.9/10. All in all, it's a competent and confident movie from all involved. Even the main man behind the screen, the co-writer and director Terry George is not randomly chosen. His earlier magnum opus is acclaimed and Oscar-nominated Hotel Rwanda"" (2004) about mass murder of Tutsi people in 1990's Africa. So it's like his second shot at the epic making glory in Hollywood. Here's hope the movie doesn't disappear unnoticed although not having superheroes or even mutants is clearly a misstep!",negative
The Promise,"Something is wrong when the downvotes are massive on a film with no real release. Then you realize its about the armenian genocide....

All Is Lost,"A man (Robert Redford) is sailing alone in his yacht but during the night, his vessel collides with a container adrift on the sea while he sleeps. The yacht is flooded and she loses her navigation and communication equipment and heads to a violent storm. When the yacht sinks, the sailor embarks in the liferaft that is carried adrift by the currents to a shipping lane. His fight for survival begins. ""All Is Lost"" tells the story of a skilled sailor fighting to survive stranded in the high sea. Robert Redford has stunning performance, the cinematography is impressive but the writer is lazy and should have researched more about navigation and lifesaving procedures. In addition, there is no character development and the viewer never knows what the man is doing in the Indian Ocean.Vessels have bilge pumps and EPIRB and pleasure yachts usually have also portable bilge pumps. Robert Redford is shaved all the time and never wears lifejacket or immersion suit or even a hat to protect from the sun, maybe because he is the star of the movie and needs to show his face. The inflatable liferaft does not seem to have the usual survival equipment and the sailor does not have a survival kit ready on board for emergency situations. But despite the flaws, ""All Is Lost"" is not a bad movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Até o Fim"" (""Till the End"")",negative
All Is Lost,"Ocean sailing that went sour. Man wakes up in the middle of absolute oceanic nowhere to find he had collided with a container, causing damage to his boat as well as rendering communications totally ineffective.The film is made as a series of events aiming for this man to fail. Once restoration and improvement of conditions is achieved, a setback occurs. He is exposed, unprotected and threatened once again. Death is constantly around the corner.The sequences are very realistic, accurately depicting the inherent risk of sea adventure. The calm is followed by a storm which is succeeded by another calm.The success of this film lies in the fact that it is held well together, despite the complete absence of dialogue and this why only an actor of the stature of Robert Redford could pull this off and is in terrific shape despite his 77 years.Ultimately, it is a tale of triumph of the human spirit that will not yield in the face of adversity and will fight to the very end to survive.",positive

Turbo,"Just because there is a wealth of animated feature films out there does in no way mean all of them are worthy of our hard-earned bucks. Only a few are exceptional, a few more are decent, while most just float on the surface of pop culture for a few weeks as a true homage to mediocrity.The newest DreamWorks Animation production, ""Turbo,"" directed by David Soren (""Madly Madagascar""), fits neatly into this category.A paper-thin plot, but with enough vivid visuals and over-the-top action to distract the little ones during its 96-minute running time, Turbo is decent family fare — if the adults in that family are not asking very much to challenge their intellect or arouse their interest.I suppose I could be more positive, however, and describe this picture as the ""Citizen Kane"" of movies in which a cartoon garden snail dreams of racing in the Indianapolis 500, but I will skip the hyperbole and just write that this storyline, while patently ridiculous, has been done — in other forms — many times before.Poor, poor Turbo (voiced by Ryan Reynolds, ""Safe House""), a snail who hopes for much more in life and strives to be fast. But alas, like most of his species he is burdened with a lack of speed and is hampered with a big brother, Chet (voiced by Paul Giamatti, ""Rock of Ages""), who just doesn't understand his wishes.One night, however, after breaking a television set and visiting a highway overpass, Turbo is sucked into an engine and overdoses on nitrous oxide. His dream of being the swiftest snail alive has come true.Infused with such speed, he is able to save Chet from a murder of crows, but also peaks the interest of Tito (voiced by Michael Peña, ""Gangster Squad""), a truck driver and taco salesman whose hobby is snail races (yes, just repeat that line a few more times and let it sink in . . .).As he uses his mutation to defeat others in this enterprise, including Whiplash (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson, ""Django Unchained""), Angelo (voiced by Luis Guzmán, ""The Last Stand"") and Smoove Move (voiced by Snoop Dogg, ""Old School""), Turbo somehow communicates to Tito how much he wants to enter the Indianapolis 500 (even though that is a race for automobiles and he, of course, is a well, you know, not an automobile).In an attempt to cash in on his popularity, if not his ubiquity, Turbo also features Ken Jeong (""The Hangover Part 3,"" among several hundred other movies this year) as the voice of an old Korean lady friend of Tito's who puts smug human drivers in their place. How DARE they not accept a shelled terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk into their midst? How it concludes is no secret, nor is the fact that this effort does not nearly rise to the level of ""Despicable Me 2,"" or ""Monsters University."" Not even a healthy dose of an extra special 3D treatment adds to the enjoyment of this production (so save your money). There is an upside, however.After viewing this with your children, you can always save the experience for that one day when you can say in a guilt trip situation, ""Look what I've done for you kids, I took you to see Turbo and stayed with you the whole time.""",negative
Turbo,"At glance, there's already a sense that Turbo suffers of being unoriginal. It is yet another ""inspirational"" film of an underdog trying to make his impossible dream come true, and the fact that the concept is about a snail wishing to be as fast as a race car, it's obvious that it's trying to resemble with Ratatouille. In execution, Turbo results differently. It's shallow when it's trying to be inspiring, but there's another message that can be much interesting than the iteration. Turbo is never ought to break some grounds nor bring any powerful drama, but it has its unique charm and humor that people may adore.Turbo may not have the smartest idea, but it tells a somehow compellingly fun story. It mostly makes fun of its own conceit, because seriously it does sound like a big joke. The plot itself is just basic storytelling where it simply explores around the characters and pull off some random humor. It hardly gets to show much originality. The central message in the end is pretty much too familiar in this time. Other than those generic points, it's actually a large satirical meme, where bigger fame and money mostly goes to the weirder talents. But for a good cause; the real heart(yet still a joke) comes to the fact that the people who supports Theo/Turbo would actually risk their lives taking him into the race, because his dream is probably the absolute hope for saving their businesses. The film usually plays like that, there's a point when it sounds preposterous even if it's supposed to be heartwarming. It's strange, but that is one of the charms of the film.The voices behind the characters can be too recognizable, but they're not distracting anyway. They all brought enough personalities in their animated counterparts. Although the story doesn't require any extraordinary or groundbreaking visual features, the animation still manages to display a lot of stylish spectacles. You can see them in the final race scene, the power line race, and the snails' imagination while slithering through their mini tracks. The 3D works great too, though it's not going to be too remarkable.Turbo is never destined to be the best. As long as it's as humble as its scale and as its main character, it's all good. It's kind of hard to get over the lack of originality unless you're honestly entertained throughout the experience. The real point of the movie is to present how ridiculous the world they made where it mocks on whatever nature and today's society do, yet scatter some thematically endearing subplots. Besides, this is from Dreamworks. They are usually known for pop culture references and inevitable slapstick humor, but here they used those elements in a smarter way. The film still has the heart that good animated movies have and when it goes there, it tends to be sweeter. Turbo is basic stuff where the fun is more than just colorful images showing off on screen.",positive
Goosebumps,"The teenager Zach (Dylan Minnette) moves from New York with his widow mother Gale (Amy Ryan) to Madison, Delaware, where she will be the vice- principal of the local high-school. Zach is bored and upset and while bringing his cardboard boxes with his belongings home, he meets his gorgeous next-door neighbor Hannah (Odeya Rush) that welcomes him. But soon her creepy father R.L. Stine (Jack Black) threatens him if he gets close to his daughter again. Zach befriends the clumsy Champ (Ryan Lee) at school and they schedule to go to a party together on Friday. However, Zach meets Hannah again but they are caught by Stine. Zach believes that Stine is an abusive father and he breaks in his house with Champ to seek out Hannah. When Zach opens a book in Stine's library, he accidentally unleashes a monster from the book. Soon he learns that the weird Stine is a famous writer of horror stories that keeps his imaginary friends that are monsters locked up in each book. But Zach released the evil Slappy that promises to bring havoc to Madison opening all the books on the same time.""Goosebumps"" is a silly film that entertains. The plot has funny moments but Champ is an unbearable character and Ryan Lee does not help with his face. ""Aunt"" Lorraine is also annoying, but Amy Ryan performs a nice character. The chemistry between Dylan Minnette and the lovely Odeya Rush, who seems to be a sister of Mila Kunis, are worthwhile watching. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Goosebumps: Monstros e Arrepios"" (""Goosebumps: Monsters and Chills"")",negative
Goosebumps,"""Stephen King is no slouch,"" commented a member of the Movie Fan Facebook Page staff. The man has published 60 books, which have sold over 350 million copies. ""Wait a minute,"" you say. ""Why start a review of a movie based on R.L. Stine's books by talking about Stephen King?"" Fair question. Well, Stine has been called ""the Stephen King of children's literature."" Beyond that, you may be surprised to learn that Stine has bested the famously prolific King by publishing hundreds of books, which have sold over 400 million copies! Think about that. It's enough to give you goose bumps. That, of course, is the name of Stine's most popular series of books, brought to the big screen in the film ""Goosebumps"" (PG, 1:43).Fans of the series may wonder which of the books is the basis for the movie. The answer is none of them – and all of them. Rather than adapting any one of Stine's books, which are, admittedly, relatively short (as Stephen King exclaims, ""Ah-HAH! See?""), this film imagines a world in which Stine's monsters come to life and terrorize a small town, while R.L. Stein himself, along with a few local teenagers, attempt to recapture the creatures and save the town. I won't spoil the movie, except to say that, in the end, we Movie Fans get a film that is as exciting and delightful as any of the books that inspired this story.The film has Jack Black portraying Stine as an unfriendly recluse in the tiny (fictional) town of Madison, Delaware. Showing Stine as a movie character which we get to know as a man, but is only a fictionalized version of the real person recalls movies like Charlie Kaufman's 1999 fantasy comedy-drama ""Being John Malkovich"" or Matthew LeBlanc (starting in 2011) playing himself as an adorable jerk in the Showtime comedy series ""Episodes"". Black's Stine calls himself Mr. Shivers. He's a widower who lives in a big house with his kind, but mischievous 16-year-old daughter, Hannah (Odeya Rush), whom he homeschools. Moving in right next door is Madison High School's new assistant principal, recently widowed Gale Cooper (Amy Ryan), and her teenage son, Zach (Dylan Minnette), still grieving the loss of his father. Gale's sweetly clueless sister, Loraine (Jillian Bell) greets them with open arms, but Zach and Gale simply have a lot of adjusting to do – and new people to meet. Gale is almost immediately hit on by shy fellow educator, Coach Carr (Ken Marino), while an awkward nerd ironically named Champ (Ryan Lee) traps the new guy into a friendship. It's a good thing for Zach that Hannah is such a pleasure to be around.One night when Zach looks towards his new neighbor's house and thinks he sees Mr. Shivers abusing Hannah, he calls Champ and they steal into the house. Zach and Champ see that Hannah's okay, but not before they find a key and open a locked ""Goosebumps"" manuscript among many on a shelf in Mr. Shivers' study. The book is ""The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena"" and unlocking the manuscript allows a large, furry creature to literally jump off the page. The three teens run after him, Hannah telling them that the monster can only be re-captured by sucking him back into the book from whence he came. The Abominable Snowman wreaks havoc on the town until Mr. Shivers shows up to save the day.In the destruction that the creature caused in the study, all the manuscripts fell to the floor and one of them popped open – one releasing the evil Slappy the Dummy. Slappy unleashes complete mayhem in Madison – on the night of a big high school dance nonetheless. The police (a hilarious Timothy Simons and Amanda Lund) are no help, but few people would be. That ventriloquist dummy serves as the ringleader of a gang of dangerous and destructive creations including a wolfman, a maniacal clown, a herd of garden gnomes and a gargantuan praying mantis. They all want revenge on their creator for keeping them locked up so long. And Stein is the only one who even has a chance of stopping them. When Stine's creations come to life, besides clear memories of Robin Williams' 1995 hit ""Jumanji"", this situation reminds us of Emma Thompson's author writing Will Ferrell's character into existence in 2006's ""Stranger Than Fiction"", or the underseen 1979 thriller ""Time After Time"" in which the character of H.G. Wells (author of the sci-fi classic ""The Time Machine"") uses profits from his writing to build a working time machine which one of his friends uses to escape the police and continue a killing spree when it is discovered that he's Jack the Ripper. ""Goosebumps"" deserves a place among these other great films.This film's story may not be completely original, but it feels fresh and it is fantastically well executed. All of the actors are perfectly cast (even Jack Black, who, in our opinion, seems to have had more misses than hits in his career). With the help of a story by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, a script by Darren Lemke and the direction of Rob Letterman, this cast and this story hit the perfect balance between frightening and fun – just like the ""Goosebumps"" books themselves. The script is very funny and the dialog and character interactions are charming from the very beginning to the very end of the movie. The interesting characters, the story's danger and adventure, along with the excitement and humor all seamlessly contribute to a simply wonderful family film that will appeal to kids of all ages, even if they don't know their goose bumps from their speed bumps or their Kings from their Stines.

A Dog's Journey,"I must admit, I was a little disappointed when I walked into the cinema - I had confused this film with A Dog's Way Home. However, when the end credits rolled, I was thoroughly pleased with my mistake. A Dog's Journey is a film that will unapologetically tug at your heart, and though cliched film tropes are consistently used, these are brilliantly effective.The best part about the movie is definitely Dennis Quaid, as Ethan, whose charismatic charm inspires us to believe in the far fetched narrative. His dog, Bailey (voiced brilliantly by Josh Gad), is always blessed with new life after passing away. When Ethan and Hannah's (Marg Helgenberger) grand daughter, CJ, is taken away from them by their alcoholic daughter in law, Gloria (Betty Gilpin), Ethan asks Bailey to look after CJ in his next life. Loving his master so much, Bailey continuously keeps his promise, though it is convenient he always happens to appear at the right place, at the right time.Quaid revels in his character, and though Helgenberger's, Hannah, is more serious (and doesn't get as much screen time as she deserves) their characters wonderfully contrast. Henry Lau, as Trent, CJ's best friend, is also a highlight of the movie - he is such a likable and caring friend, though much of his backstory (example, he often wears a suit and appears financially secure, yet we never learn what his job is) is never given to us.CJ becomes the main character for much of the film, Kathryn Prescott developing a really sympathetic character - after all, everyone loves the underdog - though her gullibility can be somewhat unbelievable. At the same time, her ark, about longing to pursue a music career, and the uphill battle she faces, is probably the weakest and most undeveloped part of the film. So too are the peripheral characters she encounters, who are mere two dimensional cut-outs, typically treated as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, whereby they experience an extreme personality shift demanded by the script to force the story in a particular direction, that is neither warranted nor deserved.Considering the film wants to touch your heart, it does throw almost every shockingly sad film trope at the screen, from family deaths, to sickness and near-death experiences, all of which have been overused before. Occasionally, after occurring, these are never touched upon again, which is not only a wasted opportunity, but illustrates that they were simply used for shock value. However, the film's portrayal of these moments, alongside the acting and the musical score, beautifully compliments them, assisting the movie in accomplishing its goal - safe to say, by the time the film was over, many people in the theatre with me were choking back tears.Although Gad's portrayal of the dog is often comedic, it never gets in the way of the film's more serious moments, giving the movie a great sense of warmth, and comedically highlighting some of the film's themes. At times, the film is very light hearted and funny, and it might have been nice if more humour had been included.Despite the criticisms that could be made, the film's touching moments make for a fantastic viewing experience. Besides, who doesn't like the always amazing Dennis Quaid? I would definitely recommend this to filmgoers who love dogs or coming of age movies; just don't forget to have a few tissues stuffed into your trousers before you do.",negative
A Dog's Journey,"Continuation of first part, 'A DOG's PURPOSE'. It will definitely make you cry, and that too several times. A really great movie filled with love, positivism and cuteness. Great cast, awesome dogs, fantastic story.

The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water,"First off, I've been watching SpongeBob since the show first came out. I always enjoyed the show when I was younger and got my baby sister into it. So even as I've gotten older I've still enjoyed watching it with her. We're definitely both long time fans. Since the new movie was coming out my wife and I decided to take my little sister to it opening night and paid nearly $12 a ticket for the 3D show. What a mistake. I maybe laughed twice the entire show. I sat there thinking this is not the SpongeBob I know. What is this? It's going to get better here in a minute. It never did. I thought maybe I was just getting too old for SpongeBob. When it was over I asked my wife and sister what they thought. They both shrugged their shoulders and said it wasn't very good and definitely wasn't what they expected. When I got home I looked up the movie reviews and was absolutely baffled at how many people loved it and we're giving it great reviews. Even a lot of the critic reviews were positive. At least there seem to be several people who agree with me as well. In my opinion a real SpongeBob fan would hate this movie.",negative
The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water,"I'm almost 100% sure this movie was made to watch while tripping, given that for about 10 to 20 min of the movie you just sit there and ask yourself, ""WTF going on?"". This is definitely a movie that can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike. If you're too good for the ridiculous humor that is SpongeBob then you should probably lock yourself in your house and keep your buzz kill personality with you. The 3D visuals were surprisingly good. In fact I would say it's some of the best I've seen. I definitely recommend watching this movie in 3D. Get up and go watch this movie and just let loose. You and your kids will love it.

The Kid Who Would Be King,"I'd give the first half a high 6, nice. A fun family adventure movie with a couple of funny parts.But then it lost steam and the second half was generic- a below average 4. I wanted to like the action but it became pretty tedious.So I guess it's a 5/10. Shame.",negative
The Kid Who Would Be King,"The Kid Who Would Be King is a heartwarming film about a boy named Alexander who finds out that he is the future king of Britain. Now he, his friends and his enemies, must embark on a quest to defeat a wicked enchantress named Morgana (Rebecca Ferguson) before the end of a solar eclipse. This film is based on the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, including the legend of the magical sword, Excalibur. At night, everyone disappears from the world except for Alex and anyone he has knighted. This way they can take whatever they want and try to defeat all of Morgana's minions. When they are all gone, Alex and his knights stay where they are and everything else returns to normal.There are lots of cool scenes in this film that involve exciting sword battles. In my interview with Patrick Stewart (Merlin), Rhianna Dorris (Kaye) and Louis Ashbourne Serkis (Alex), I learned that the cast used real swords to train with to learn the real feel and heaviness of medieval swords and armor. However, in the actual film they used realistic plastic swords, because otherwise it would be too dangerous.My favorite character in this film is Merlin (Angus Imrie/Patrick Stewart). He is serious and gets things done most of the time, but he also does a lot of funny and cool things that are really appealing to watch. For example, when he does his magic, all the stuff around him is flying through the air and all the lights are flickering. That is a really interesting effect.My favorite scene is when Alexander and a few of his knights are rushing through the woods on horses, while trying to defeat a large army of fire monsters on fire breathing horses who are trying to take Excalibur away from them. This scene is very exciting and has a few funny parts in it too.The message of this film is that anyone can be a king; you just need to have a good heart and follow the knight's code which says that you must ""honor those you love, refrain from wanton offence, speak the truth at all times and persevere in any enterprise until the end.""I rate this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 7 to 18, because it is a good combination of an action movie and a heartwarming storyline that gives it a great message. I think adults will enjoy watching this with their kids.Reviewed by Damon F., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kdisfirst dot org.",positive
Jack the Giant Slayer,"This film tells the story of a farm boy who battles giants from the sky valiantly, alongside brave soldiers and the princess of the kingdom.I put off watching ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" because the giants are really ugly! During the film, I kept having sweaty palms because of the scenes involving heights. Those scenes were really scary. I liked the lead character Jack, because he is approachable boy next door. It is a refreshing tale to see him rising through the ranks and valiantly serve his country. The interweaving story telling scenes in the beginning annoyed me a little, because I thought it was a bit too forced. Overall, I like ""Jack the Giant Slayer"", because of the poignant ending.",negative
Jack the Giant Slayer,"After my friend made me watch Red Riding Hood. I was almost convinced that fairytale adaptations could never be great. I was wrong. Jack and the beanstalk was a suitable fairytale to be adapted on the big screen. It had giants, heights, and monstrous plants. The whole theater was laughing nonstop, and below are the reasons why. 1. The parallels between Jack and Isabel (the most clichéd name for a girl, btw. Remember Twilight?) when they were young children and then grown-ups.it showed that people who come from different backgrounds can be similar, and that they didn't just end up together because they went through some adventures, they were fated from the beginning. 2. I like the tie-in from every random scene. Etc when Jack was giving a pompous speech and everyone kneeled down and he said, ""there's someone behind me, right?"", it wasn't just some random thing, but it was repeated later to show how Jack had grown from a commoner to a prince. 3. The action! The movie isn't afraid to be gory and scary, what with human torture, murder, the last stand, and giants. 4. They purposely made the bad guys ugly and stupid, easy to hate. Especially the sidekick who died such an ironic death. 5. I like how Jack was portrayed as a brave and smart guy. He didn't just trade a horse for 5 beans--he was supposed to exchange the beans for 10 copper coins! He figured out how to kill giant in an ingenious way. Also he is nice to everyone, and handsome to boot. 6. And I love how the movie ends up being related to the modern world, shows how smart is film is. It doesn't need to be in a ""fantasy"" because it makes sense and is realistic! Just don't go in with low expectations, you will be pleasantly surprised!",positive
After Earth,"This film is about a space craft that crash-landed on a dangerous planet called Earth, and the only two survivors have to struggle to stay alive.The first few minutes of ""After Earth"" already look not so promising, and it only goes downhill from there. Acting is consistently bad by Jaden Smith, he is so annoying as a teenager who constantly freaks out. Will Smith is supposed to be a fearless commander, but his supposed bravery makes him so wooden as if he was a wax statue.The plot is simply ridiculous. There are so many plot holes that are so obvious, that they simply should not happen. For example, if Will Smith is such a great commander, how could he not command people to wear seat belts when they were about to hit a meteor shower. And the masks are not even connected to anything!? The whole story, from the macro level to the micro level is very poorly written and makes no sense. The supposed emotional climax is so weak, that I wonder if that scene is really supposed to make me feel proud of what is shown on the screen.""After Earth"" is a terrible mess. This time, believe the critics.",negative
After Earth,"After Earth should be retitled After Birth, because that is exactly how sloppy and dirty this pathetic excuse for a film is. Gross analogy, I know, but trust me, a delivery room after a woman has given birth is a better produced show then this. I honestly don't even know where to start. The film decided to market itself as a Will Smith film, which was the only way to get people to go because of how silly its plot is. Even the Will Smith fans were let down because all he does is sit in a chair the whole time and speak to his son in an over-serious and unintentionally hilarious monotonous voice. He easily gives his worst performance to date, but it is not quite the worst acting in the film. Jaden Smith gives a Razzie worthy performance as an underdeveloped character with a useless upsetting past and an ear-cringing accent. He whines and makes the most stupid mistakes a film character has ever made in the history, provided by the horrendous Shamylan-Esq screenplay where you can't tell if its supposed to be funny or not. ""He let me borrow the book Moby Dick, he even let me hold it.""""Hold what?"" ""The book...dad"" Word for word. This comes off as a terrible joke some sixth grader tries to make, and there are many nonsense lines like this crammed into the ridiculous plot with gaping and obvious plot holes. Why is he making a fire when he's right above a geothermic vent? Why in the heck did the bird who just tried to eat him save his life? Why is that oxygen mask working when its not even attached to anything? Why did Jaden need to get higher on the volcano to send out the transmission when he was just getting closer to the ""radioactive cloud""(dafuq)? A ton of these mistakes are so obviously scattered throughout the terrible script. It really just makes it funny. If you enjoy being entertained by stupid movies, I definitely recommend you check this out because it is so bad its funny.GRADE: D- (The only reason I'm not giving this piece of crap an F is because it's still not as bad as Last Airbender, so you need to give Shamylan some credit)",positive
Despicable Me 2,"CAREFUL! I went to the cinema yesterday to watch this movie because I liked the first part and because I trusted in the good rating here on IMDb which was a mistake. Maybe you like Despicable Me 2, but if you are looking for a movie like Despiceable Me 1, I want you to know that THIS MOVIE IS NOT COMPARABLE TO ITS PREDECESSOR. I liked the predecessors extraordinary and impressible sense of humor - which has become damn silly in part 2. I also liked the story and its message in part 1 - which has become ordinary and cheesy in part 2. Sad that they did not put half the effort and love into this movie compared to Despicable Me 1.",negative
Despicable Me 2,"In all honesty I can't remember the first film that well, so I found it hard to compare to the sequel. On the other hand this film is completely memorable and so enjoyable.I saw the preview and I absolutely loved it. I was worried that all the good bits were in the adverts but the film was full of exciting and hilarious parts that aren't in the advert. The minions are so funny, I was actually crying with laughter at some parts. In fact, I enjoyed it so much I am taking my little brother to see it again (mainly so I can see it again! Hehe) The characters are lovable, hate able, and hilarious, the film has evolved from the first one (from what I can remember) and its such a heart warming family film.I COMPLETELY Recommend THIS FILM :)",positive
The Mountain Between Us,"When I left the cinema after enduring this film my thoughts immediately turned to IMDb and what kind of response it would have had on this site.I imagined that (like myself) there would be floods of complaints about the wooden acting, the ease at which the main characters just sauntered through their 'ordeal' as though they were just nipping to the shops for a pint and a dozen eggs, and thought that it would be universally hated.I read one review today that said this was the worst movie they'd seen in the last thirty years.Well I sat through Dads Army, I just about managed to stay awake during the Absolutely Fabulous movie but even those two flops were more convincing than this film.What is supposed to be a high drama survival movie is a bland, dull, uninspiring walk through the snow for an hour and half. Even the moments of peril are dealt with in as short a time as possible with no fear or risk involved whatsoever. The romance is unconvincing to me. Before anything happened between our two lead characters I was thinking to myself that these guys clearly didn't like each other at all during the filming of this movie. There was little to no chemistry, the acting was woeful (from two of movies finest actors supposedly) and it all just seemed tired and as if nobody on the set wanted to be there.The story's climax isn't a climax at all. It's just a sudden give-up on what had come before.I have to agree with the chap who said they'd not seen worse in a long long time. This was most definitely the weakest of all the movies I've seen in years. My advice to anyone considering it is as always go and make your own mind up. But don't say I didn't warn you.",negative
The Mountain Between Us,I read the book and there is a reason why the book is a best seller...but the movie did not follow the book by any means... I was so dissapointed that I wasted my time watching a bad version of a great book.,positive
The Host,"The current score on IMDb is too low. This is a fairly good film. It's worth about a 7.5. To see the true IMDb score, click the link for the number of users and look at the bell graph. Eliminate the 1s and 10s, and you'll see that what you're left with is a solid 7.Saoirse Ronan was perfectly cast for this role as the sensitive, conflicted alien slowly gaining the trust of the human survivor group. Diane Kruger and William Hurt were also good. (Once again, I'm struck how so many Hollywood movies lately have non-American actors playing Americans. What's that all about?) ""The Host"" is part of a new genre I would call ""sci fi for chicks"". If it bothers you to see a ""soft"" science-fiction film with love-sick young people, noble suicides, impossibly handsome young men, aliens with emotions, etc., don't go see this one. It's the old male v. female dilemma: Should we kill the hated aliens or coax them out and make friends with them? There was not enough exposition at the start about the horrors of the alien invasion. The writers and producers seem to have assumed that moviegoers would understand why the characters want to ""remain human"" and why they would refer to a human-hosted alien as ""it"". Perhaps it was better explained in the book.The device of Melinda's consciousness remaining fully alert, and Wanda and Melinda actually talking to each other for our benefit, might put some moviegoers off. (I'm not sure. I haven't read the other reviews.) However, once I suspended my disbelief, I was able to go with the flow.They threw the male viewers a bone: Kruger and Ronan, to start. there were a few car and motorcycle chases (involving futuristic-looking chrome vehicles), and shoot outs. Hey, this is a Hollywood movie, after all.The theme of humans hosting aliens is not original, but they took the concept in a different direction. The movie is slick and well made, but there were a few clichés and many, many aspects of the story that were glossed over, left unexplained or just not realistic. The survivors here were mostly young Hollywood pretty boys, not a ragged group of tough survivors (like on ""Walking Dead"", for example.)Still, I appreciated some of the details of the ""good alien"" theme, like a society of honest and trustworthy aliens that doesn't need cash to function, or where they will simply give you their car if you need it, or where everyone drives at the speed limit. (God forbid we should have a society like that! Kill them!) And I liked the part where the other seekers looked at the evil seeker (played by Kruger) and pointed out that she was getting a little too obsessed. After all the aliens saw themselves as the good guys. There are many species that coexist in symbiosis. It's interesting to think that maybe it would do our species good. This is actually a very old theme. There's not much difference between ""her body has been taken over by an alien"" and ""she is filled with the Holy Spirit"", or even ""she is possessed by a demon"".",negative
The Host,"Outside of The Twilight Saga, The Host is Stephanie Meyer's biggest novel and since the success of her supernatural series, her sci-fi novel has been adapted. There is a stronger cast and director for The Host, than the Twilight Saga, but how does it fare on its own terms? In the near future, Earth has been conquered by a parasitic alien race known as The Souls, who implant themselves into human bodies. Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan) is a member of the human resistance who gets captured when she tries to protect her younger brother, Jamie (Chandler Canterbury). Melanie gets implanted with a Soul, called Wanderer, with the aliens planning to use Melanie's memories in order to find the human resistance. As Wanderer explores Melanie's memories, she finds out about Melanie's lover, Jared (Max Irons) and the pair plan an escape to the desert to find the resistance camp. Within the camp, Wanderer falls for another human, Ian (Jake Abel), causing problems for all of them.Let's get the comparisons with Twilight out the way; yes there is a is love triangle (or should that be a love square?), The Host has a much better lead actress with Ronan then Kirsten Stewart and has a stronger supporting cast, with the likes of William Hurt and Diane Kruger. Andrew Niccol also gives the film more creditability behind the camera, acting as both the writer and director. The Host has interesting ideas that had many potential avenues to explore: but unfortunately it focuses more on the love story instead of all of the other aspects that could have lead to a much more meaningful film.Ronan does rise above the material and gives very strong performance, as you would expect from her. This is even more remarkable that she has to argue and talk with herself, like Homer Simpson arguing with his own brain. Whilst there was the potential for themes of locked in syndrome as Melanie is trapped inside her own head, fighting to control her own body or going through a more literal, internal conflict. But it turns really silly when she argues with herself over two men, as opposed of having a much more difficult time of having a stronger conflict within her character. Ronan gets battered and beaten throughout the film as she gets hit, verbally abused and discriminated against and yet, still persevere through everything she's up against.Whilst Ronan does a good job, the two men she is meant to be conflicted about are blank stales. Neither actor has much of a personality or character and they are very indistinguishable from each other. Ronan has no choice but to carry the film, considering that there was nothing going for the main love interests. At least Hurt and Kruger looked like they were having fun with their roles and were highly professional with their performances.The idea of some sort of insider for an oppressive regime having an awakening, usually because a love interest and ends up turning against their own side has been used before. We have seen it in novels like Nineteen-Eighty Four, Fahrenheit 451 and We and films such as Metropolis and THX-1138. The Host does twist this age old idea in sci-fi, even if the execution was lacking.The Host had a really strong premise with opportunities to explore multiple themes. They could have been themes about identity, the battle within the mind, split personalities, trust and how humans would survive after this invasion. But like Twilight, the film only touches on these concepts and puts all of its focus in the wrong places.Much like Twilight, The Host has been criticised for its dialogue and being unintentionally funny. It is true that the film has some bad dialogue, but with some of the moments that were comical that had be intentional, with some of its moments of cultural clash and the bickering between Wanderer and Melanie. There are also some dark moments and there were really refreshing when they do come around.Niccol is known for being an excellent writer director, making Gattaca and Lord of War and was nominated for an Academy Awards for his screenplay for The Truman Show. The Host is his first adaptation and it felt very rigidly close to the source material. What it results to is a bland experience that has episodic nature, having mini-plots with some developments, instead of a larger overarching story. Looks wise, the film is pretty flat and dull, using nothing but silver chrome for the alien technology, concrete and glass for the buildings and the humans are based in an empty desert environment. The cinematography and the special effects were solid but, Niccol was coasting and he is much more capable then this.Currently on Rotten Tomatoes, The Host has an 12% rating and seemingly on course to be considered one of the worst films of 2013. Whilst it is hard to argue that The Host is a good movie, it is certainly not terrible: its crime is merely being mediocre, dull and forgettable.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",positive
The Legend of Hercules,"Let me start off by saying I am a huge fantasy fan. I can usually enjoy any swords and sorcery type film and find something good about it. Now let me say Wow this movie was bad. I mean I thought this kind of clumsy, lowest common denominator filmmaking died in the 80's. It is bad when I asked the organizer to give me a refund on a free prescreening.Where to begin? I don't expect much in this type of movie in terms of plot or characterization. In action ""porn"" like this, the plot is usually just barely coherent enough to move from one action sequence to the next and the characters are as black and white as a chessboard. This movie somehow delivers LESS than that.It is staggering to me that with a mythology as rich and engaging to draw from, they choose a tired rehashing of Gladiator as the main focus of the film. No doubt holding the more interesting material back for future sequels. The laughable love story is unengaging, poorly scripted and given far too much screen time.What really disappoints is the action sequences. Hercules is supposed to be a demigod that achieves the impossible; the movie portrays none of this. It wastes a good deal of time with a clumsy mix of fighting scenes in which Hercules is repeatedly captured and/or defeated. WTF? It is only towards the end that an attempt is made to show Hercules as he should be seen, but I had tuned out long before then. Oddly enough, the blood and gore in this film is kept to a minimum, probably to keep it at PG-13 in hopes of duping the largest possible audience to drop money on it. It would have really benefited from a Conan-esque level of violence to give the movie more weight and better directed action sequences. The dramatic pause in the middle of the action (made famous in the movie 300) is in every single action sequence. I really don't know what I recommend from this film. Everything in the movie has been done better in other films. I hope this film tanks but I doubt it. It will make a profit and encourage more of the same I'm sure.",negative
The Legend of Hercules,"The only thing worse than this movie is having to watch it in 3D and have the awful come out of the screen at you. Horrible. The guy who plays Hercules should be arrested and tried in court for crimes against humanity. The actress who plays Hebe gave so many awkward moments in this film she should be sent to MTV to coach the 16 and pregnant girls how to lose their man. The fight scenes in this film start off alright; but gradually turn into WWE backyard wrestling. The scene near the beginning where Hercules fights the horrible CGI Lion was so horribly done that I almost walked out on the film then. Sadly, I decided to wait until much later to do that. I would add more to this review; but I was smart enough to actually leave and try to save the rest of the night with ice cream and though I should go to a crisis center. Sadly, they do not have a ""center for the people who just saw the worst film ever"". Do not see this movie; you have been warned.",positive
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,"I want to write a different kind of review for this movie because every other bad review has already said most of what is so bad about it.

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,"What on EARTH are the people who have raved about this film watching? Anything other than a co-ordinated, presumably paid, campaign of solicited positive reviews seems improbable to me.I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I loved the opening movie of this new take on the franchise for it's original and thoughtful way of kick-starting an updated 21st century imagining for the birth of sentient apes. I read Pierre Boulle's ""Monkey Planet"" in the 70's, and loved the original series of movies (even the naffer, later ones after ""escape""). This may be largely influenced by my youthful age at the time and general love of science fiction.I have no problem with the willing suspension of disbelief or escapism. A film doesn't have to make perfect sense in ""the real world"" for me to appreciate it. What i do have a huge problem with, however, is the lazy and cavalier way this movie utterly cuts loose from the premise so carefully set up in ""Rise"", and which i was intrigued to see explored further in this plot less, pointless travesty.There is so much wrong with this movie that i am simply unable to catalogue it, however, here are a few pointers.......1) it is set just 10 years after ""rise"". Yet, in this time, the West Coast of America has in the main turned into jungle. Old petrol stations are shown looking as overgrown and integrated into the greenery as various Inca ruins look today, surrounded by mature trees that tower above them.2) There is a massive population of smart apes who can use sign language, and some talking apes living in the jungle. Far more than the indigenous population of the west coast could ever explain (though only (count 'em) one Orangutang, called Maurice, in the film's only nice touch - a nod to Maurice Evans who played Dr Zaius in the original). He, at least, can also write, scribing ""Ape not kill ape"" etc on rocks, which the baby apes can presumably read??? Are you chuckling yet? In just ten short years since ""rise"", 100's of thousands of years of evolution have been spread liberally, though very unevenly, across this vast ape population, who presumably flew over to the states when they heard how cool the west coast was to hang out at these days. Though, even the apes who can't talk yet, sort of grab that extra bit of evolution needed to get a bit shouty when some ""dramatic"" piece of ""plot"" development spurs them individually on....Actually, i am losing the will to go on, since i would run up against the 1000 word limit long before i ran out of ire at the lazy, trite, inconsistent, banal, clichéd ""plot"" so i will limit myself to one more observation.3) once the apes grab automatic weapons, as they invariably must, they become instantly proficient in their use and have the supernatural ability to summon UNLIMITED AMMUNITION from the same mysterious realm that transported them all in, forged their tree dwellings and bypassed Darwin so succinctly. Plus, they get the ability to put tanks on autopilot.And i didn't even start on the humans tale.....what the hell was Gary Oldman thinking of, appearing in this pile of chimp manure. Or the overblown schmaltzy soundtrack, which ""helpfully' illustrates important emotional, or dramatic ""events"" in the film.Truly, this is an experience beyond parody. As Charlton Heston would undoubtedly have commented to the director and writers of this movie ""You maniacs! You blew it up! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell""1/10 for very fluid CGI, though in 2014 i begin to question whether this warrants any points, such is the accepted state of the art?",positive
Home,"What baffles me more than the movie itself is the fact that there are so many ten star reviews of it on this website. Do you people like watching crap? Do you enjoy having your soul ripped from your body, mangled, then shoved back in? Are you all mad?This movie isn't the kind of blatantly bad movie that you walk out of snickering to your friends about. This is a new kind of bad; one that I have never encountered before. There is something so sinister, so manipulative about the way this story was executed that I left the theater confused and horrified.The movie starts of with our main character, Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory, talking in stupid grammar. Then he meets Rihanna, who is even worse at voice acting than he is. Badger from Breaking Bad is also in there somewhere. Steve Martin also joins this baffling cast, sporting a disturbing mustache. While the latter two did a good job with the awful lines they had to read, our two main protagonists, Sheldon and Rihanna, could not read lines naturally to save their lives.The plot was really strange; easy to follow, but strange. There was definitely something wrong with the editing, and I wouldn't be surprised if the editor wasn't even fully conscious when he was cutting and pasting the scenes together. The pacing was all over the place. The movie felt like it ended three times before it actually ended. The action scenes had no tension. The emotional scenes came out of nowhere and confused me with their weight. The jokes were forced and felt flat on their faces.The biggest and most glaring problem with this movie is the music. When they weren't playing EVERY RIHANNA SONG EVER, the movie treats us to the worst orchestral score I have ever heard in my life. Every time a song played, it felt inappropriate. The action scenes were either accompanied by bafflingly quiet Dubstep, or strangely quiet orchestral music. Every time an action scene started, the music got quieter. You don't DO that! Did the aliens IN the movie make this movie??There are so many things I want to say about the movie, so many questions about WHO made these creative decisions and WHY they are still allowed to roam freely on this earth. This was just abysmal! It's terrible! There are very small fleeting moments of genuine emotional weight, and there are a few slightly clever lines, but it's all wrapped up in a flurry of terrible jokes, and terrible music, and terrible voice acting that it's CONFUSINGLY bad. I wanted to like the main characters, I really did! And there were moments when I did feel genuine sympathy for them, only for all that sympathy to fly out the window and into space because the editor quickly cuts to a completely different scene with a very different emotional feel to it. Or a terrible Rihanna song starts playing and ruins the mood. The one good thing about the movie is the animation. I enjoyed the effect of the aliens' skin color changing based on their emotions. I liked the design of the ""evil"" aliens, for the most part. The main character girl's hair was very well rendered. The movie looked beautiful, just like a turd looks beautiful when you polish it.Overall, this movie is an absolute train wreck. It's kind of funny how Rihanna voices one of the main characters, and most of her music is featured in--WAIT A SECOND. BACK UP. BEEP BEEP BEEPRihanna plays one of the main characters and her music is featured prominently in the movie. HMMMMMMMMMMM SEEMS A BIT OF A STRANGE COINCIDENCE, DOESN'T IT???!!I digress. This is a bad movie. One out of ten, would never watch it again.",negative
Home,"I had not really high expectations on an animated movie, my son would probably enjoy something like this way more than me I thought. Huge Fail. The movie was from the beginning great and not only for kids. It is a feel-good movie for all ages. It is about family , friendship and that being different or just being yourself is not a bad thing at all. I found the movie throughout entertaining and very often funny.The Boov's are just too funny in particular Steve Martin as the voice of Captain Smek, whose firm leadership of the Boov people is undermined by his ridiculous fascination with human artifacts such as bubble wrap . He reminded me partially on King Julien from the Penguins of Madagascar.But even if you are not touched by the great story you will certainly love the Soundtrack. The whole movie was perfectly set and is for me the best Dreamworks movie since a long time. Take your kids and watch it on the big screen, they will love it! and you too, guaranteed.Verdict: A great story meets perfect cast and nothing can go wrong on this alien/ human road trip movie.",positive
The Good Dinosaur,"I follow certain filmmakers in a way unlike any other relationship. If they have worked well for me at least once, they become a permanent part of my life, not friends or family because I give nothing back. When they try and fail, it becomes something of a failure of mine to learn from.Pixar is in this class of 'filmmakers' because there I see a certain consistent set of ambitions and values. Creative, polished story is what most people see, but what interests me is the deep exploration of what it means to tell stories visually, cinematically.These men and women aggressively expand the cinematic vocabulary. Sometimes it is local, in some minute orchestration of character movement; I am not skilled enough to see and understand where these are new. But I can see and understand how they push the way we can communicate about *space* and the movement of the eye in it.In this, they have two concerns. I've remarked elsewhere on the most visible one: how they understand the third dimension and where we place the camera. They can expand this because the camera is no longer physical. They've gone so far as to design whole story worlds to allow for stretching this. The other experimental area is more subtle and perhaps more influential in the long run. It used to be that the environment in films was that we lived in, and incidentally captured by the camera. Except in very rare cases, like some of the work of Welles and Kurosawa, it is static, dead, not able to participate in the communication. In cartoons, the background was ever more so.But CGI breaks that boundary as well. I saw the problems they had with trying to innovate with conscious snow interacting with conscious hair in Brave. They had all sorts of other difficulties with this film, many of them not relevant to the experiment in conscious background but it has to be considered a success.The story isn't particularly novel in having the environment be the protagonist, but it is novel in the emotional texture they were able to impart to that environment. The characters' texture and form have been reduced and that of the environment increased. There was never in reality water this full of life, vegetation with this much unified presence. They moved the old story-focused director out and moved in a texture animator and incidentally gave him a story to tell.It is not typical of Pixar that the filmmaker is allowed to make a statement, but here we have him creating a character that enters the story and announces his intentions. He is part of the environment, appearing first as a tree and stepping out to be a multi horned creature that 'collects' pets that each play a role. This is one of the most sophisticated in jokes I recall, directly related to the focus on the background as foreground.",negative
The Good Dinosaur,"It's pretty amazing that so many people seem to want to trash this movie. I watched this with my 2 daughters and my 10 year old said it was the best movie she's ever seen. She identified with Arlo's anxiety and insecurity as she also feels this way sometimes. His journey in dealing with these issues by facing his fears and, even if sheepishly at first, challenging them one by one helped her to understand herself. It allowed her to see that others struggle and can overcome these struggles in a way she hadn't seen before... up close and personal. As a child and adolescent therapist in practice for over 16 years, I can definitively tell you that any movie that prompts a child to look into themselves... to challenge their fears... and ends with them hugging you tightly, is a true marvel to behold. It's the core of the emotional artistry that movies are meant to be. Having an emotional connection to a movie or any work of art for that matter, will always win out over special effects and beautiful backdrops. It's the reason Star Wars: A New Hope was brilliant and The Phantom Menace sucked. Anyone have any kind of emotional connection to The Phantom Menace these days?",positive

There was no explanation for any of the concepts, character development was nonexistent, special effects were plentiful but meaningless.

Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle,"Some may complain that it is a very different take from the Disney version. Fine.

Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle,"In performance-capture maestro Andy Serkis' hands, Legends of the Jungle is a darker, more surprising version of The Jungle Book. Get ready to leave behind the jungle of your childhood imagination. You know, the one where you slumber peacefully in a tree bough, waterfalls ain't nothing but slides and you can float downstream resting on the upturned belly of an amiable bear.It's impossible not to keep comparing Serkis' version of this classic story to Disney's 2016 live-action remake of its own 1967 animated family favorite. In Disney's remake, the animals are remarkably photo-realistic. But Serkis is purposefully trying to achieve something entirely different. The motion capture is used to make the animal characters deeper, richer and almost more recognizably human.This no doubt presents more of a challenge for the actors than straightforward voice work, and as a result the animals are expressive and affecting. They're more well-rounded and relatable than their Disney counterparts, even if they're not as instantly charming. Christian Bale's nuanced performance as Bagheera the panther and Benedict Cumberbatch's ferocity as tiger Shere Khan are standouts that translate particularly powerfully through the performance capture.But as you'll have guessed from the film's title, it's not all about the animals. In Disney's version, Mowgli felt more like a narrative device drawing the animals of the jungle together so we could hear their stories. In Serkis' hands, Mowgli is less of an ensemble player. His character development is central to the plot, especially in the second half. The movie feels like a coming-of-age tale as the man-cub seeks to establish his identity as not quite human, not quite wolf -- simultaneously both and neither.It did come as a surprise when, bang in the middle of the film, the plot veered wildly off course from the familiar narrative the Disney films established atop Kipling's work. Some may hate this startling divergence, but I enjoyed the sudden realization that I didn't know exactly what was going to happen next, especially after being lulled into a false sense of security by familiar opening scenes.Serkis has made a visually arresting film that Netflix is lucky to have gotten its hands on. It has more than the bear necessities required to put it on your watch list, even if it is lacking the music.",positive

However, when Piggy Island is hit with a massive ice ball, Leonard discovers a third island. This new location is overseen by Zeta (Leslie Jones), a vengeful eagle.Now seeking a truce with the Birds, Leonard and the Pigs need their help in stopping Zeta's reign of terror. Red (Jason Sudeikis) is skeptical but agrees on the condition of once again playing hero.Gathering the team together -- including hyperactive speedster Chuck (Josh Gad), ticking time bomb known as, well, Bomb (Danny McBride), Leonard's assistant Courtney (Awkwafina), and Pig inventor Garry (Sterling K. Brown) -- they realize that they're missing a brainiac, who emerges in the form of Silver (Rachel Bloom), Chuck's little sister, whose banter with Red has very obvious romantic tension.In a subplot, hatchlings Zoe (Brooklynn Prince), Beatrice and Lily (Faith and Sunday Urban) accidentally lose track of Zoe's unhatched siblings, taking them on a journey of their own.Of course, the last thing to expect from a movie based on such a game is, well, for it to be better than average. The Angry Birds Movie 2 is. It may come off in promotional material as silly and juvenile, which it is but couple that with a lot of parental bonuses and you got quite the entertaining 97 minutes. 4/5.",negative

Comedy relieves stress and this movie will enchant you on my own responsibility.",positive
A Dog's Purpose,"This was a tear jerking, laugh inducing, emotional roller-coaster of a solid family flick.While it isn't quite Marley & Me, it was as close as you can get. The acting was adequate and the writing may be forgettable but the love between of Man's Best Friend and the many characters in this film is palpable. I was hesitant to spend money on this film after hearing the negative animal abuse allegations against it, but I found them to be false. Apparently TMZ made it up.So get ready for love, pain and lots of laughter that makes this a must see for every family! Just be sure to take tissues with you.",negative
A Dog's Purpose,"A Dog's Purpose is an awesome movie about a dog's love for their human. The movie literally portrays so many different ways that dogs are treated. A Dog's Purpose did an amazing job at building up raw emotion in a short amount of time. Very similar to the way we felt in Marley and Me. It is an absolute shame that this movie will be swept under the rug by many people because they believe everything they read on the internet. The videos show that ""Hercules"", the dog in the scene that went viral, was apparently being forced into the water. Hercules was chosen to do this scene because of his affinity to water. He was trained to jump in on the opposite side of the pool to what was shown in the video. After the trainer tried to calm him by letting him test out the water and the dog still was spooked, they stopped attempting the scene from that side. There were multiple people in the water if something happened. There was even a diver constantly under the dog at all times. However, PETA and every news organization does not want to report this because they just hop on a hot topic without any research. I have 7 dogs, 4 are rescues, and I used to work at a veterinary clinic, so I have seen so many cases of abuse and a dog getting wet is not a form of abuse. The movie builds a human's love for their dog, and it really portrays how a dog is truly a man's best friend. If this movie wasn't boycotted, I honestly feel like it could have led to many people adopting dogs from shelters so they can feel the same love that us dog owners have.",positive
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,"I'm not quite sure why Xander Cage returned, I just wish he hadn't. This movie is so low brow, you might mistake it for a caterpillar. It's devoid of anything that looks like a plot or decent character development. Instead its cheesy show off time with lots of tat's, juvenile bravado, sparkly overstated jewelry and guns from ""da hood"". This is a film that feels, in my opinion, like it was made by a 15 year old nick-named ""flipper"" (as in hamburger flipper) and his gormless, pimply friends. We all know thats not true but you get the idea.In short a genuinely excruciating experience that puts the S in Stupid.....one out of ten from me.",negative
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,"The score on IMDb is ridiculously inaccurate. This is not a metaphysical interpretation of life in a drama. This is XXX. This is Xander Cage at his best! The action is well shot and over the top as expected. The jokes are cheesy and perfectly timed. Minor spoilers, there are some cameos and they nailed them!The support cast in a movie like this sometimes ends up being annoying or getting in the way. Not so in this one. Every character is unique, fun, has the right amount of screen-time, and does not annoy. There is no drama or tension, nor does there need to be. This is not meant to be ""The Departed."" This is a super fun action flick where you can just smile and watch Vin Diesel nail another awesome flick out of the park.Some people complained about the new cast feeling out of place. Not so, they did an amazing job. I feel this movie revived the XXX franchise and am already hungry for another one! Again!",positive
Planes: Fire & Rescue,"The story revolves around Dusty a lovely plane who learns he cannot race anymore as his engine is about to burst. Not one to give up he tries to prove he can still be useful.Whilst it is admirable for one to not lose spirits in the face of adversity the way this has been displayed in this animating adventure has proved ineffective.Dusty comes across as a stubborn plane who in his refusal to accept he is damaged and stay put manages to constantly endanger himself as well as other planes. There is a failed attempt, a telling off, then another incident and another etc... Given he cannot race he opts for becoming a fire-fighter but the problems remain, his engine is not up to the task. More failed attempts and endangerment.Whereas the spectacle/cinematography is acceptable the moral of the story falls short and given how the cinema was filled with youngsters something tells me it did not convey a very poignant message.",negative
Planes: Fire & Rescue,I do not understand why everyone is so down on this movie. The story is original - talking planes fighting forest fires - can't recall that being done before. The animation is top notch. The characters are funny. The movie went really quick....which is a good thing in my mind. There were NO political messages as was the case with the Cars movies. They could have easily spun a global warming message with the fire fighting but didn't go there. Be sure to sit through the credits to find what happens to the park administrator. This movie is much better than Planes and almost on par with Cars II.,positive
Bacurau,"Just viewed Bacurau at the Mill Valley Film Festival and found it incredibly hard to sit through. Clocking in at 2 hours and 10 minutes it was often tedious for me to sit through. While slasher king John Carpenter homages prevail here I am not convinced the genre is effective in making a statement about the right wing political environment in Brazil right now. The critics appear to love it though.If you love dead bodies piling up by the dozens with décapitations, buzzing flies, buckets of blood and some gratuitous sex thrown in for good measure this is the film for you!",negative
Bacurau,"This movie gets you going in a way that maybe you weren't expecting from an action thriller and shows genuine characters that you come to care about really early. It also introduces you to a place that's rough and angry and you realize that there's a perfect symbiosis with this rugged land and with its people. The problems they suffer on a daily basis ( lack of water, food, unwilling and corrupted government officials ), make them to the eye of certain people and corporations as second class citizens and maybe PREY!!!",positive
Skyscraper,"Where to start think every action cliche put it in Hong Kong with poor CGI and poor 3D you have this film.
You get the feeling The Rock is just doing this for the money. 
It took me roughly 10 minutes to work out who the bad guys were.
You can sit through this painful film and tick off every action they have ripped off.
Nothing positive comes out of this film it will win awards RAZZIES.
Film only made for the China market. 
Come on Hollywood fans are demanding new ideas not more rip offs and remakes.",negative
Skyscraper,"This movie was billed as an action/thriller. Period. And it delivered just that. I honestly don't understand how people give it a bad rating. If it was that bad to them, why did they even stay and watch it through? Every movie isn't made to win an Oscar (not that that makes something good anyway) nor does it need to have some feminist, LBGTQ, save the planet, hug a tree, anti-American, liberal agenda. Some movies are for entertainment. Most of the crap coming out of Hollywood nowadays have to have some deep thinking motive or be a comic book hero story. This movie is entertaining, fun, and it kept my wife, son, and myself on the edge of our seats from about 10 minutes in until the end. What's wrong with that? NOTHING!!!! Sometimes it's just fun to watch a movie and root for the good guys and be against the bad guys. I enjoyed it and highly recommend it. Don't read all the bad reviews and be dissuaded. Grab some popcorn, something cold to drink, and enjoy it for what it is, a fun action thriller.",positive
Paddington,"Usually, I'm not a very nostalgic person and I'm certainly not a person who watches Dinsey films as an adult. However, Michael Bond's Paddington has always fascinated me since my early childhood. The idea of an innoent bear from darkest Peru integrating into British society has intrigued me much. The novels have a lot of creativity and soul as they offer beautiful life experiences and valuable morals. Since I have always loved animals, it wasn't a surprise that I was always rooting for the sympathetic young bear.In many cases, live-action or CGI animated movies fail to capture the essence of the novels they were inspired by. To my very positive surprise, this is an entirely different thing for this particular movie. The animated bear looks splendid and the actresses and actors around him do a very credible job, making us believe that the young bear is truly around them. Paddington doesn't look out of place in contemporary London and actively interacts with his diversified surroundings.The story is nicely crafted as well. It tells us the sad yet hopeful background story of the charming young bear in a concise way. We then explore how the bear finds a new home, new friends and new experiences in London. There are many humorous scenes that put a constant smile upon your face such as Paddington taking a bath in a very chaotic way. Despite creating so much chaos, the young bear changes people around him in a very positive way. On the other side, the movie also has a dramatic side as Paddington is trying to find out more about his origins and comes across a pitiless taxidermist who stuffs exotic animals. The mixture of light-hearted comedy, gripping drama and surprisingly humane life lessons from a young bear is absolutely splendid.As someone who isn't nostalgic, I was truly moved by this film and enjoyed it from start to finish. The makers of this movie have managed to recapture the magic of the novels and bring them onto screen. Paddington is a very rewarding experience for younger and older viewers. If you aren't familiar with Paddington at all, you have missed out on something and discovering this fascinating franchise will change your mind about children's literature. In times, when cinemas are flooded with gruesome Battle Royale copies, it's refreshing to go back to such a classic franchise with a pure message. Watching this movie will make you feel like an innocent child again. Bears are the better human beings.",negative
Paddington,"""I LIKE THE BEAR,"" a little girl exclaimed behind me during the first few minutes of Paddington. The delighted reaction took me by surprise, and then it turned into a reminder. The farther I drift away from childhood, the longer I avoid interacting with elementary-aged children, there is a tendency to forget that there is such a thing as kids movies and family movies. I saw The LEGO Movie with my dad, true, but even then, it felt like I was watching a slightly sanitized version of The Simpsons instead of a reprehensible Pixar knockoff.These days, family movies try as hard as they can to appeal to the kiddos and their parents; maybe executives know how excruciating it can be to sit through a particularly painful foray into baby-talk and recycled jokes. Though it isn't my personal favorite genre, it is undeniable that family films please more routinely than any other category in film. So much emphasis is put onto each project that it's rare to find a stinker among the handful.But most children's films are only good, entertaining for the time being but not packed with enough quality to have an impact for more than a few months. Imagine my surprise when Paddington went from 0 to 60, straight into my cynical heart. Paddington is far too marvelous to throw around the effective cliché that it has something for the kids and something for the adults; like Babe, The Muppets, and yes, even Frozen, it transcends our prejudiced assumptions and takes us inside a fairy tale where anything can happen. It doesn't matter what age we are; it is as if you could throw dust into the air, only to find it fall in a golden flurry. Paddington shouldn't work, but it does. It does so well, in fact, that I can say with full confidence that it is one of the best genre films of the decade.Paddington the Bear is already a beloved literary figure, of course, but when we first meet him in his own star vehicle, it is as though he is new again. As the film begins, we find him living in Darkest, Peru with his aunt and uncle (Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon), both of whom are marmalade obsessed and intelligent enough to speak in cultured British accents. The film explains this noteworthy phenomenon: decades earlier, an explorer arrived in Peru, and, smitten with the bears otherworldly craftiness, taught them how to act as if they were civilized human beings.After tragedy strikes, Paddington's aunt decides that it would be best if her nephew went to find a home in London. When he arrives at a train station, most disregard his exuberant politeness, but not Mrs. Brown (Sally Hawkins). Her family looks at him with differing levels of judgment, especially her husband (Hugh Bonneville), but the Brown's pity him, eventually deciding to take him in.Paddington may have inimitable manners, but he surely isn't gifted when it comes to gracefulness (in a hilariously mounted comedic sequence, Paddington discovers the joys of the family bathroom, only to flood the entire house). Most would give him up, but with his considerable charm to make up for his klutziness, he even wins over Mr. Brown. But just as things begin to look up into storybook heaven, Millicent Clyde (a scene- stealing Nicole Kidman) enters the scene, a blood-thirsty taxidermist who wants nothing more than to stuff Paddington for her latest exhibit.With its candy-colored imagery and bouncy humor, Paddington is impossible to resist, a feature that really and truly makes you relive the glorious innocence of childhood. Voiced by the genial Ben Whishaw, Paddington is a fluffy friend for the ages, more cuddly and comical than Despicable Me's famed Minions. The CGI used to flesh him out is so convincing that every single strand of fur sticks out with remarkable detail; there were times I forgot that Paddington is an outright miracle of animation, not a real-life talent I could meet on the red carpet. There you have it. Paddington doesn't need an analysis, nor does it need a critic to highlight how much of a wonder it is. It is an unusually magical and unusually well-crafted family movie that needs to be watched immediately. Take you mom, take your dad, take your sister, take your brother — take anybody. Because, like the little girl who sat behind me during its extraordinary 95 minutes, I like the bear.Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com",positive
Beyond Skyline,"Where to start, on a high i guess at the end... It finished with a comedy blooper reel which was the only time either someone on the screen or in the room i watched it in, smiled.
After the first film you would of thought the government would of used the alien wrecks to figure something out should they attack again, nope, they go down in seconds... though after 40 mins of listening to a baby crying a smack head in the jungle figures out how to destroy them in about 30 seconds, thou not before deciphering a childs human genome in less than a minute of course. Not that the armies advance weaponry was needed as a few jit stains from the jungle managed to kill most of the aliens with a selection of small knifes.
This has just taken over Skyline as the worst sci-fi movie I've ever seen, how they got the green light for a sequel is beyond any reasonable logic, if you like those £2 Steven Segal movies you see in bins at petrol stations, then your likely to bump into this quicker than most. And if you thought it was good, you seriously need to reassess your standards... or get some in first place...",negative
Beyond Skyline,"I read some of the reviews of this and would like to say how much I disagree. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie in the theater. I really enjoy the story and effects. Maybe it does not have a completely new idea. Invaders from space have been done many times. This one is very original in its thoughts on how a superior race would accomplish this. If you just set back and enjoy it without judging every little imperfection, you will enjoy it. And I am way over twelve. I was that age when star wars first came out. Take a look and enjoy the originality and great effects. Enjoy!",positive
The Willoughbys,"I like the idea of the story and I love the actors, but I'm really upset by the message it sends to children. The story is about neglected children that send their parents away and at one point in the film the ""Orphan Protective Services"" shows up to take them away. At that point the nanny gets really scared and tries to run away with the kids to protect them. The OPS then storms into the house in a very scary manner. As someone that has worked with children in abusive situations this scene can really influence children's fears about being taking away from abusive parents. It might prevent children from reporting abuse and instill fears that being taken away is worse than what they are experiencing. I do feel like it's important to talk about abuse and to not hide it in movies, but at the same time, helping children understand that the services that are there to protect will actually protect them.",negative
The Willoughbys,It is sad and quirky and adorable and heartwarming. Like Lemony Snicket type of premise but with rainbows and candy. Its inclusive. It shows that not all parents know how or even want to be parents. For the kids that don't see this reality represented to them often in cartoon style it's refreshing. It has a great message. Thought provoking and can potentially start up a convo with the littles.,positive
Hardcore Henry,"I believe this to be the very First Person movie produced for mass audiences. The trailer is enough to captivate anyone that watches it at first glance, so I was excited to make sure I watched it on the big screen because it didn't seem like the type of movie that would be worth watching at home. I didn't go watch because of the plot, I went, like many others, just for the experience of a 90 minutes of a first person action film. Where it failed: All sequences looked the same except with different ""thugs"" and different guns. It felt like the movie looped at least 4 times. I am not sure the correct word to use in this situation is ""bored"" but I was tired of the same thing over and over by the first 30 minutes I wanted to walk out, but I didn't want to miss ""SOMETHING"", which never really came. The experience was not that great, it was not like the 180 degree cinemas they had back in the days where they would put you on the seat of a roller coaster and you could really feel like you were part of it. I wasn't able to feel included, it did not really seem that immersive as I thought it was going to be. Although I didn't come for the plot, I have to say this movie was just weird. I won't get into the details but it was all over the place, a mess really. I am not sure more like these will be produced, It will all depend on how the mass audience reacts to the title, but although I do not see a future for ""first person movies"" I do think this is a gateway into 360 Virtual Reality movies, which in theory at least, sounds very interesting. I have to say, go watch it for the experience of something completely different, but don't expect anything out of the ordinary",negative
Hardcore Henry,"'Hardcore' is the riveting story of a newly-made cyborg who must save his wife from evil tyrants and...wait a minute. Who cares?? The whole movie is a blast!!Ilya Naishuller is a young director who had a very cool idea to shoot an action film from a first-person perspective using a GoPro Hero3 Black Edition camera. The proof of concept was released as ""Biting Elbows: Bad Motherf***er"". It was pitched publicly and helped to successfully crowd-fund the feature, 'Hardcore'.It's better to keep this short and sweet: the film is extraordinarily violent; not for the squeamish. It has plenty of action, free-running, stunts, and plenty of room for comedic elements. Even the opening titles give you a taste of what's to come!Sharlto Copley (District 9, and other Neill Blomkamp projects) plays the main POV's assistant throughout the film. Copley definitely gives a range of character performances and is quality. Wearing many hats, he guides you along as if you were needing assistance in a video game, which, by the way, this film makes several references to. In particular, the Chernobyl level in Call of Duty 4 with Capt. MacMillian. Even the opening scenes are reminiscent of Half-Life, and a lot of the free-running scenes are inspired by Mirror's Edge.For those who are wondering, no. You likely won't get dizzy watching a 90-minute action film from an FP perspective. Well, maybe you shouldn't sit in the front row. Otherwise, you will have a blast.'Hardcore' is an all-around fun time. Just be okay with the violence. It's only 90 minutes of your time that you'll likely want to experience over and over again. Or, you'll just want to plug in a play a few games. Either way, it's bloody fun!",positive
R.I.P.D.,"Having read some other reviews, my expectations were low. I'm so glad we took a chance on this little gem.We went to a matinée. Everyone in the group I went with enjoyed the movie. The rest of the audience in the theater was laughing right along with us.My husband was chatting with a couple of folks as we were walking out, and they were saying that they could not figure out why this movie was getting such a bad rap because they really enjoyed it too.Jeff Bridges was hilarious in his role as the experienced cop and Ryan Reynolds was marvelous eye candy. Kevin Bacon played a bad guy we all had a good time disliking.The special effects were so good that they never took you out of the movie to think about how they did it, you just went along for the ride. Some of the friends I went with can't handle 3D, so we saw the regular version.I can't remember laughing out loud so much in a theater in a very long time.All in all, I'd say we had a great time and highly recommend this movie as summer escapist fun!",negative
R.I.P.D.,"I saw he trailers and wondered if the movie would be as funny, or if they had shown all the ""good stuff"" in the trailer. Well, I'm happy to report that the trailers captured much of the essence of the movie, but the movie itself has much more. I don't know what some of the critics expect. Shakespeare? Hey, this is a comic book movie. It is a fantasy. It is not real and not meant to be real. But it IS also fun. It is quite possible that this movie will lose money, but that is simply because of bad positioning, overwhelming competition, and failure to deliver adequate advertising. But none of those things detract from the movie itself. I went to the movie with some trepidation, but found it to be funny and entertaining. It was consistent with its premise and it certainly had enough action, and even (gasp) character development. There is nothing really deep about this movie, okay? But it is good summer entertainment and definitely worth seeing.",positive
Arctic,"I am a huge fan of Mads, so was really sad not to have enjoyed this film. It was the opening film for our outdoor cinema in Western Australia so I had invited everyone.
Superficially it's ok but I just spent the whole time picking fault with it.
Snow blindness, wound infection, hypothermia, normal bodily functions ignored. I'm afraid it was all to neat and clean for me.
Goerge Orwell said the one thing that lingered in his mind about the Spanish Civil War was the overwhelming smell of human waste.
Well the film didn't have to descend too low but not real enough for me.",negative
Arctic,"For what the film showed it was too long. ok I get what they wanted us to witness but to watch the same and the same stuff again and again for 1 hour and a half it was tiresome.
there was virtually no scenario.....not any suspense if u exclude a few scenes especially at the end.
in general excluding last like 10 minutes a scene with a polar bear and the scene in the beginning with that helicopter the movie was a repetition and a repetition of the same stuff.
if this film had lasted half an hour then it would be a great film.
for an hour and a half that it lasted it's not. it's average and tiresome.for me it's a C- 4 out of 10",positive
47 Meters Down: Uncaged,I sat down to watch this movie with unbiased Hope's as I do with any shark movie lover. It started off bland and I was bombarded with cheesy and vague character development. The old cliche highschool bully story and the sister or friends that stand up for the victim. The foreshadowing was the most obvious thing. Straight shot to let's sneak behind peoples backs and go cave diving all the while telling 0 people where we are going. That's not even all of it. Sharks that can somehow live in a cave so long that they evolve but didnt make it out? Yet they can literally swim backwards and are blind. The real kicker is the fact that they go off hearing instead of the pores on their snout. Oh and get this they decide to add in a few cheap jump scares to add suspense and kill off the people you were rooting for except for get this - the sisters- big surprise. The list goes on and on but I'm getting infuriated just attempting to type this review. Save your 10 dollars and go buy a cheap pair of swimming goggles if you want some real entertainment.,negative
47 Meters Down: Uncaged,"If you go into this movie looking for anything other than dumb, popcorn entertainment. Turn off your brain and don't think about the plot holes. I did, and I ended up really enjoying it. It was actually one of the scariest movies that I've seen in a long time. Let me start off by saying that I'm mildly claustrophobic and just the premise of being trapped in an underwater cave with the entrance blocked had me my skin crawling. But the jump scares were effective, too. And they didn't try to justify the silliness with science or anything else. They just leaned into it. I would suggest anyone seeing this movie do the same.",positive
The Last Days on Mars,"First off. The description for this film states that it was made at Elstree Studios, Borehamwood, England. The interiors and sound were both done at Ardmore Studios, Bray, Ireland. Just thought I'd put that out there.It's basically a zombie movie set on Mars. People develop an infection, die, come back and again and try to kill the nearest person. Who carries on in similar fashion. Never been done before so.You get the impression watching it that the director has seen a few sci-fi movies. He just doesn't have anything original to add to the genre.The script is pedestrian, humourless, predictable; with no sense of the impending doom that should have bled from the screen. From the moment the Russian guy falls into the hole in the ground, you can pretty much figure out what's gonna happen. And it does. Exactly as you'd expect it to.Films are supposed to take you out of yourself, surprise you, entertain you, immerse you in the world that they have created. This film did none of those./yawn.",negative
The Last Days on Mars,"This review is intended to win over those who love sci-fi, but feel a little wary of even viewing The Last Days of Mars due to the poor overall review ratings. There is a severe dearth of science fiction movies out there, let alone good ones, so if you're like me then you can identify with allowing yourself to relish in whatever a movie does well to immerse you and bring sci-fi to the screen convincingly.First, I'll tell you what I want to see when a sci-fi movie involves a space theme. I want equipment, vehicles, space ships and sets to look detailed, interesting and look like they belong there. I think they did an excellent job with all this. I'm sure an astronaut or annoying know-it-all snobs could point out whatever may be incorrect, but it all looked awesome to me. It made me feel like everything was filmed on mars, or in a space station etc.Long before I ever saw this movie I recall having read that it was very low budget. It never looked that way to me. Everything looked so professionally designed. To give an example, I loved how the land vehicles looked. They were a typical 6 wheeled monster, but were particularly detailed with what looked like logos of tech sponsors and flags of whatever countries were imagined to be involved in space exploration. That was some subtly added depth for me.The special effects and CGI looked flawless to me including a small zero gravity scene and flashback scenes of a space station for example. The backgrounds outdoors on mars also looked quite impressive to me as well. I've never really seen photos of Mars, but the rock formations looked foreign to me. I couldn't tell you if they were CGI composites or not. That's a good thing. Overall, I am astounded they could accomplish what they did with just £7,000,000 for the budget. I would have expected to see cheaply painted foam rocks at every turn, plain white panels everywhere and no CGI whatsoever for that price. The acting never really takes a back seat for me, but it was amazing by any standards I would hold for any high budget drama movie. The cast was absolutely fantastic including the supporting actors. The dialogue and behaviour of the characters never had me rolling my eyes either. Many of the characters were easily likable and the one that we are meant to dislike manages to be dynamic within the story line. That's rare in this type of movie. The story is zombie themed as you may have read. I'm painfully aware of how overdone this theme is, and although this take on zombies won't surprise or scare you in new ways, it doesn't ruin the movie. The reason is because the characters seem to behave believably and the zombies don't possess more power than the usual superhuman toughness you've come to expect. Thankfully, you won't see idiotic scenes that countless horror movies do with characters putting themselves in stupider situations than you could even imagine. If you must slam the story for being typical and mediocre for its story I can't really argue with you, but I sure as hell am not willing to listen to you. This movie won't ever top some of my favourites, such as Solaris (1972), or Moon (Sam Rockwell), but once again, if you want to see a movie where the sets and technology make you feel like you're in space, you will get some enjoyment out of The Last Days on Mars. The superb acting and cast is a welcome surprise bonus.",positive
Johnny English Strikes Again,"This movie made me laugh two times. And that comes from a Rowan Atkinson fan. Dull to non-existing humour, very very bad dialogues, very awkward moments, which should have translated in fun, but instead they turned out to be a stupidity and boredom. 
It looks like someone tried to implement the fun aspect of Mr Been (who almost never speaks) and force him to interact with other characters, unsuccessfully.Olga did her best to be the fatal/sexy russian spy, but it was extremely hard for her, because of Mr Been's character, instead of Johnny English.There are a lot of silent moments which bring no value, a lot of old tech references which can be fun, if used properly. This movie made British country and people look like a bunch of idiots, MI7 as vegan, politically correct, humanitarian organisation. 
Please avoid it at all costs. Millions of brain cells will die!",negative
Johnny English Strikes Again,"I enjoyed the first two Johnny English outings. Admittedly I wasnt expecting the latest adventure to be anywhere near as good due to Johnny being that bit older.
But he still has that inimitable magic ! To appreciate these movies, it is suggested that your brain is turned off and reality is suspended for the duration. Its all incredibly silly, an unashamed spoof of Bond films. If you can do that, then you will love this movie. I have not laughed so much in years.",positive
Girls Trip,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Period.Nothing but flat, unimaginative, repetitive, cringe-worthy scenes glued together. The story is absolutely terrible. Four women: the Queen (who's is kinda done), Mrs Smith (who is really too old for this movie), the Party girl (who over-acts in every scene) and Ryan (who's emotional scenes are worse than a school play and who's voice cuts through steel). Going on an trip, to have a good time, to fight, to get back together and to happily live ever after.There is NOTHING new to this story. Nothing interesting. Nothing funny. Really...nothing...funny. Just stereotyping. A lot of stereotyping. And what is the added value of all the 'blackwashing' in this movie? I don't get that at all.In conclusion: every, bloody, second of this movie is so cringe worthy, so annoying on so many different levels...as if the makers and actors really tried to make a s*cky, boring movie.Shame on you! Avoid as the plague",negative
Girls Trip,"I just saw this yesterday with my wife and I wanted to see it more than her. It was absolutely hilarious. I grew up watching Queen Latifah, Jada Pinkett, and Regina hall. Tiffany Haddish was amazing as the funny as hell / silly friend she portrays. Haddish had some of the funniest lines / scenes I've ever witnessed and she played them very well. I needed a good laugh and this film delivered. I laughed every minute for a long time, unless something more serious was going on, and even then, I had a smirk on my face. The whole theatre laughed as well, it felt good to laugh in conjunction with a bunch of other people.This dramedy was just what I needed and it brought me back to the days when I too had a crew to roll with. Now that I'm approaching 30 I only have one real friend from my high school / college days and the nostalgia the film invoked within me was much appreciated. This film is full of dancing, laughs, and great depiction of what friends and people actually go through. Check it out for yourself! I cannot wait for it to be on DVD/Blu-ray so that I may add it to my collection and laugh once more.",positive
Ice Age: Collision Course,"Original is not a word that comes to mind when watching the fifth (yes FIFTH) entry in this tired, worn, quite frankly burned out franchise.What does come to mind however is the fact this franchise has gone on for far too long.If you can't come up with any original ideas and you have to scrap the deepest barrel for the most unoriginal idea as possible, it's time to go.If you can't keep your characters fresh and funny and make them more boring, dull and annoying to watch, it's time to go.If you're out of jokes to use and you pull some random rabbit out of a hat and it's a rabbit that says ""Think of some really bad jokes mate."", it's time to go.If you have 4 (yes, I do mean 4) writers and not one of them can give any good dialogue out, it's time to go.And when a franchise that is constantly dead in the water is still going like THIS, it's time to go.I don't care if these films still make money, Fox, it's time to put this franchise on ice forever!",negative
Ice Age: Collision Course,"While trying to bury his acorn, Scrat accidentally activates an abandoned alien ship that takes him into deep space, where he unwittingly sends several asteroids en route to a collision with Earth.Meanwhile, Manny is worried about the upcoming marriage between Peaches and her fiancé, Julian, while Diego and his wife Shira want to start a family but their fierce appearance tend to scare kids, and Sid is dumped by his girlfriend, Francine, just as he is about to propose to her. During Manny and Ellie's wedding anniversary party, some of the asteroids strike the place and the herd barely escape with their lives. Meanwhile, at the underground cavern, Buck returns a dinosaur egg back to its rightful owner after it was stolen from a trio of Dromaeosaurs led by their father Gavin, only to discover an ancient stone pillar, which he takes to the surface, where he meets Manny and the others.Buck explains to the herd that according to the pillar, the asteroids had caused several extinctions in the past and with a massive one still incoming, he claims that the only place they could find a clue to stop it is on the site of the impact of the previous ones, as according to its engravings, they always fall at the same place. However, the three Dromaeosaurs, having listened their conversation, decide to stop them, believing that they could be safe from the impact, as they can fly, thus not only getting their revenge on Buck, but also killing all mammals and securing domination over Earth for their species.As the herd travels to the crash site, they discover that the asteroids have electro-magnetic properties, thus if a huge quantity of smaller asteroids should be gathered and launched into orbit, they could attract the main asteroid as well and prevent it from falling on Earth. After facing several obstacles and the interference of the Dromaeosaurs, the herd arrives at ""Geotopia"", a community of animals formed inside one of the asteroids that have fallen long ago, where Sid meets Brooke, a female ground sloth who falls in love with him. However, Shangri Llama, the leader of Geotopia, refuses to cooperate with Buck's plan to send the city's crystals into space in order to prevent the imminent impact, as they are the key to the residents' longevity, until Sid unwillingly destroys the entire city when he attempts to remove one of the stones to present Brooke with, making all the Geotopians grow old up to their real ages, including Brooke herself.Once Brooke convinces the Geotopians that preventing the asteroid's fall is more important than their lost youth, they and the herd help with Buck's plan, which is to fill up a geyser with the crystals so that the pressure launches them into space to draw the asteroid away, but the Dromaeosaurs attempt to intervene, until one of them, realizing that they will not survive as well if the asteroid falls, convinces the others to also help. The plan works, and the asteroid is pulled back into space. The herd then departs back home, including Sid, who parts ways from Brooke, but just after they leave, an asteroid piece falls inside a hot spring, giving it rejuvenating properties and making the Geotopians and Sid's granny, who stayed behind with them regain their youth. After the herd returns, Peaches and Julian celebrate their wedding, Diego and Shira become heroes to the kids who were scared of them before, and a rejuvenated Brooke appears during the ceremony to reunite with Sid.In the film's epilogue, Scrat keeps struggling to control the alien ship until it crashes on Mars, destroying all life on the planet.",positive
The Do-Over,"I'll keep this short and sweet. This is just plain awful. I usually enjoy Adam Sandler movies, but this was plain horrible. Considering Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison are two of my favorite movies I expected more. The only chuckle I got was David Spade's threesome scene. The rest of it was either predictable and just not funny at all. How Nick Swardson keeps making his way into Sandler's movies is beyond me. He is quite possibly the most unfunny person on the planet. As I write this I am an hour and twenty minutes into it and I doubt I can suck it up and watch the last 25. Don't waste your time. This was 80 minutes of my life I wish I had back.",negative
The Do-Over,"Not sure what happened to Adam Sandler recently because his movies when from really funny to painfully bad. Consequently, I clicked on ""The Do-Over"" with more than a bit of trepidation. Still, it had a decent number of stars and the best part about Netflix is being able to stop watching as you see fit. Well, surprise! surprise! I ended up being very glad I took a chance on this flick.No, this is not the next Citizen Kane, but if you are looking for a feel good comedy, then you owe it to yourself to watch it. I confess that the inclusion of David Spade also was a huge plus for me, but even if you're not a Spade fan, there's a good chance you're going to enjoy ""The Do-Over"". Yes, there are still of few jokes that rely on juvenile and gross themes for laughs; however, overall this is a delightful movie with a lot of heart. Put another way, it actually has a plot that keeps you engaged, instead of a string of crass jokes with very little story and/or a story that's so dumb you simply cannot get into it, as has been the case with many of Sandler's recent films.Another aspect of this movie you are likely to enjoy is the scenery. It appears they filmed mostly in Puerto Rico and Georgia, the peach state, which made for some nice backdrops. The other thing I enjoyed was the action. The story included a fair amount of gunfire and car chases, so if that's a selling point for you when it comes to movies, you'll have even more to love.Now, I'm not saying this is a family film. While it is uplifting, this is definitely not a movie for the kids. There is a lot of sex and violence, some of which was super R-rated, so if you have kids maybe wait until they're at gram-gram's for the weekend before checking this one out. And if your children ask to see it, unless they are in college, just say no.No Sandler's somewhat sophomoric humor might not be for everyone, but if you aren't one of those people who take everything too seriously and believes only highbrow comedy is worthy of your attention, then this movie will make you laugh out loud.I only hope this movie is a beginning of Sandler's return to form. He obviously has the potential to produce good films and shows when he doesn't go overboard on cheap laughs at the expense of storytelling, so here's hoping he remembers that in the future. Personally, I wouldn't mind seeing more movies like ""The Do-Over"".",positive
How to Train Your Dragon 2,"Loved the first one. My favorite animated movie in the last 10 years - high anticipation for the sequel.Went with my 3 kids on the opening day. 30 minutes into the movie and I see my kids yawning and slouching in their seats. Two older ones whisper to me, ""dad, this is really boring."" There is no way around it - it is very boring until the last 10 minutes of the movie. I do realize that this is an animated film, one that revolves around vikings riding a flying dragon. But you still have to have a strong plot, one that follows what happened in the original movie. There are moments in the movie that make you think, ""Huh? Where was that in the first movie? Where did this (sub-plot) come from?"" A case in example: Hiccup's mother is alive? And she never bothered to try to come back to her family for all those years? (And this is one of the more believable parts of the story.)Weak storyline from beginning to end, not engaging at all, left the theater very disappointed.",negative
How to Train Your Dragon 2,"'How to Train Your Dragon' is my all-time favourite animated film, so when I heard a sequel was being made, I knew it was one I had to see. The last animated film I saw in the cinema was 'Toy Story 3' four years ago, so going to see this beautifully executed flick was a treat. This film truly lives up to its expectations and builds upon its predecessor's achievements like any good sequel should, and from this, the outcome is stunning. More mature and thematic than its predecessor, 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is an emotionally resonant and heartfelt flick that expands upon the story of Hiccup and Toothless and their connection. With swooping and stunning visuals and epic animated set pieces, this is a sequel to remember, a modern masterpiece.",positive
Spectral,"I've seen a couple of straight to Netflix films and to be honest, with the exception of Bright, I've mostly been disappointed. So, you can probably understand the apprehension I had when it came to watching this film. Well, it turned out that I could not have been more wrong because, honestly, this film was nothing short of awesome. As another reviewer pointed out this is the type of film that Hollywood, when it does well, can go really well - not much story, but great action and great special effects. Well, story, I probably wouldn't say that the story was that bad either.The film is set in Eastern Europe, which honestly is a break from your typical Middle Eastern terrorist trope of late, but then again the whole Middle Eastern terrorist trope is honestly so naughties. No, now we are going back to Eastern Europe, and the not so subtle 'Russia is the enemy' again, which honestly opens up so much more for secret technological experiments that have the potential of completely overwhelming a force of highly trained US soldiers - which is what the case is here in this film.Yeah, we are in Moldovia where a totalitarian government has collapsed, but there is still fighting going on between insurgents and rebel forces. Yeah, the US is here, but they are only here as peacekeepers (which is probably a little unrealistic anyway considering that in this part of the world the US are openly sending in their troops to keep the peace, particularly since there happens to be another superpower just over the border that happens to have a completely different interpretation of what keeping the peace happens to mean). Anyway, there seems to be some strange things going on, and the government decides to send this DARPA scientist over to find out what's going on.To cut a story short, it appears in all intents and purposes to be ghosts, but there actually is a lot more behind the fact that they are basically fighting ghosts, but I honestly don't want to give too much away because that would spoil the fun (and I've already had some shows spoiled because I have accidentally read ahead while trying to find out other things). In a way though, this film did remind me a lot of Black Hawk Down, but with a much more supernatural element to it than the previous film, which was just American soldiers killing heaps of Somali's, and somehow managing to survive the encounter.Well, it felt like that in part, that is until I realised it was a little more than that, and in whole 'let's get the hell out of dodge' part of the film was probably only about a third, namely because the are actually going in there to attempt to get their wounded back, and also to possibly capture one of the ghosts. It is only when they realise that they are way, way over their head that it becomes evident that retreat is the only option.Yeah, this film actually turned out to be pretty intense, and was much, much better than expected. It certainly is one of those films that will keep an sci-fi action buff entertained for a little over an hour and a half.",negative
Spectral,"Netflix have really upped their game with their original titles lately, and this film is no exception. The acting is good, the story is relatively original (considering how many themes are usually recycled ad nauseum in sci-fi) and the special effects were absolutely outstanding.The pace of the film is perfect and there's never a reason to lose interest, especially as our cast delve deeper into the mystery of what's going on and how to deal with it. The tension themes were similar to Darkest Hour & FF:SW insofar as you never quite knew where the threats were going to come from at any given time, despite the countermeasures in place. Some people have compared the story with those two titles pre-release, and after watching you can see how it could be inspired by them, but only as much as other themes in cinema inspire each other; the story itself is very original.If you like your action with an original story and extremely well- polished, then you'll probably enjoy this.",positive
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,"This is the last time I sit in the middle of the row. Had I been sitting on the aisle I would have left long before the movie was over.Maybe if I were in the 13 to 24 age bracket and had grown up playing video games...Or maybe if I were still a little boy at heart and still played video games...One reviewer lauded the ""jaw dropping"" visual fx. Really? Was this person exaggerating or just haven't been to the movies in about 20 years? Nothing new here. Same visual fx you'll see in any 200 million movie or a video game.The bottom line is this movie is just like a big long expensive video game. If you like that then go see it. Except don't be disappointed if they don't let you have the controller.Don't get me wrong, I think it's totally cool when a bad guy can get run over by and Escalade(after having beaten up The Rock, for crying out loud) and get right back up and run away. It's also kind of cool that he can get on a motorcycle, start it, put it in gear AND ride safely away in less time than it takes for said Escalade to hit a dumpster. Also, it was interesting that Duke had the time to yell ""Incoming"" get Flint out of the way yet he sits there and takes it like a man. I guess Tatum wanted out of his contract. Maybe he saw this going the same way as Police Academy 15.I'm not sure why I expect so much from a movie based on a toy. My only question is where will they go next? They have GI Joe, Battle Ship, Transformers, Rock'em Sock'em Robots(Real Steel)... what's next? Toss Across? Battling Tops? Maybe they'll make a sci-fi flick about silly putty. (I wonder if producers read these things to get ideas)And the dialog was pretty bad. I was trying to remember one particular line that was really bad but I guess it was so disgusting that it ran screaming out of my memory. RZA was the absolute worst part of the whole thing. The Rat in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was a better actor than RZA. Where's Master Po when you need him? I'm not sure why anyone thinks Rappers make good actors. Anyway, lots of action, some way hot chicks who kick but (always cool, IMO) AND there will probably be another sequel.If all that sounds like it's worth $10 bucks to you then have at it. I wait until movies come to the $2 theater and sometimes they aren't even worth that much.",negative
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,"G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra feels like it belongs to a different age of blockbusters. It had a hard time fitting in to the modern generation thus most moviegoers never find it as appealing as the other films that was released on that year. Those rants can be true only in some reasons. The film is undeniably silly and dumb but it was never boring and has its own quality. Since people are now asking for darker and much serious blockbusters, this sequel reduces all the silliness that was displayed on the original. G.I. Joe: Retaliation is cooler and less cartoony. Unfortunately, it is also less exciting and terribly uninspired. The action may be better looking but the lack of fortitude and creativity made it fall short into another visual showcase stress.""Awesome"" is the main goal of this sequel. While the original was too corny to impress, this film darkens the tone and made it a bit down to earth. It abandons the silly gadgets and the ridiculous laws of physics that was shown in the original. But the film fails to be both dark and realistic. Not only because of those robotic fireflies and the mass annihilating missiles but the secret prisons and the government are unbelievably dumb to manage their job. Well, it's a blockbuster based on toys so it will never be too realistic. Deal with it while we are here for the fun. The dark aspects aren't dark at all. What they only do is to be serious. This seriousness blocks the potential joy and turns it into standard blockbuster bland.The storytelling is quite messy. It's like an uninteresting version of Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol with uninteresting characters. The storytelling from the first movie wasn't great either since it is cluttered with cheesy flashbacks. But it's worse here because it takes some twists that are absurdly incoherent. And so, it's all pretentious. The characters are boring and even the performances can't bring them to life. Dwayne Johnson is the only good thing among them though, Bruce Willis is trying to make fun of himself again as a crazy grandaddy, and the villains ham it up which isn't suppose to be a bad thing but they can't give enough personality to them.The action scenes are acceptable enough to call awesome at least. With all the explosions and the none CGI-ed machines, it seems to be really exciting, but it's not. It does a fine job to be pretty but there's a difference between good looking and exciting. There's only a little suspense. If there is actually suspense and joy then it would be found at the mountain ninja fight but it's just mild and still glosses some slow motions in it. For the rest of the action, the heroes are always superior. Plus more explosions and slow-mos. The action is stylishly directed anyway. The fight between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow remains to be the only action that excites and one part of the climax has a nutty scene with The Rock riding huge vehicles and shooting like a badass. The production designs, special effects, and costumes gets better. What else to talk about it?The absence of the Joes' ridiculous transportation and weapons, holograms, and other snazzy gadgets may please our modern viewers but it also forgets why this material is interesting anyway. Now we only get typical military stuff. It still has some crazy devices but it's limited compare to the first film. Rise of Cobra wasn't a classic. It's nothing more than a simple guilty pleasure. Same with Retaliation except this one can't even be completely pleasurable unless you want some endless visual coolness. Cool is not a bad thing but it could have been creative and much more exciting instead of showing off slow-mos on screen. To be fair, it's mildly entertaining and good to look at. If the film wasn't this visually awesome, it would have been an empty cinema. The series still fails to justify its source material.",positive
The Lone Ranger,"I think Rotten Tomatoes finally got it right this time. Giving this film less than 25% approval rating is on the mark. I wasn't a fan of the original series, but I knew that from the trailers, I probably would not like this film. I still gave it a shot, and boy did it fail to deliver, miserably. This movie is essentially a Pirates of The Caribbean movie, set in the Old West. Johnny Depp as Tonto is doing the same old shtick he did in Pirates, Jack Sparrow basically wandering through the desert. His attempts at humor are the same, deadpan expressions as he wanders through overly exaggerated and unrealistic special effects sequences. His sidekick (sorry, but that's essentially how the power relationship is set in this film) is a scared, gun-shy lawyer John Reid played by Armie Hammer. Throughout the movie, we are supposed to be cheering this guy on, hoping he can avenge the death of his brother and bring the bad guys to justice. But all he does is whine and complain. They should have called him The Moan Ranger. Depps performance was quite bad, and I would say, offensive to native Americans of all nations. The way he talked, his behavior, I mean, they tried to explain it away as him having been scarred emotionally as a kid, but really, it sounded more like an apology for Depp's stereotypical portrayal. There were also weird random things that left one's head scratching, like the crazy rabbits that popped up. What the heck? Are we to believe that this stuff was based on reality, or are just watching the fantasy laden recollections of an aged Tonto who's liberally adding these elements to entertain the little boy in the 1933 museum? The part about the movie that really bother me, however, was the fact it had an overall feel that it was geared towards families, but there were scenes of such nasty brutality and violence, it was a really upsetting juxtaposition. Now, I'm all for gory and violent films, I watch them all the time. But those films are rated 18A. This one gets away with a PG or PG-13 rating, but people die horribly, and in many cases, for no reason. I guess the fact that they don't show any blood spurting out is why the censors and ratings board gave it a pass. Overall this film is quite boring. I was taking power naps through many of the slow parts. It barely picks up speed, and when it does, you don't really care anymore. And why just have one locomotive crashing scenes when you can have two! Yes, two train crashes in the same film, talk about losing creativity. It felt very repetitive. None of the supporting characters or actors stood out. And quite frankly they felt just as annoying as The Lone Ranger himself. I think the white horse was the most interesting character on the screen. Avoid this movie, just rent it for $2 out of your local movie dispensing machine. Send the studios a message, so they won't make any sequels, and they'll bury this attempt at a franchise for good.",negative
The Lone Ranger,"I tend to side with critics often, and usually find they are on target - case in point- Man of Steel - which I had the highest of hopes for, and felt it was mediocre at best. So, I went in to Lone Ranger with low expectations based on reviews I had read from the so called experts. I was a fan of the series as a kid. Was not sure what to expect from this. Well, This is the Lone Ranger movie for the 21st century. It was fantastic. What movie did these critics watch? It set a perfect tone. Depp was terrific. Hammer was pitch perfect - he became grew to be the Lone Ranger. It left me wanting more, and movies rarely do that for me. Spread the word of mouth - we need this movie to have legs so we get a much deserved sequel. Trust me, its GREAT. And my 7 y/o son loved it just as much.",positive

The fact is that the omission of Henry Tracey Coxwell the lad who was Glaisher's copilot is another shameful act by Hollywood.
A film that claims to be based on ""true events"" should at least give credit where is credit is due.

Pompeii,"This is one of the worst films i have ever seen. A rehash of Conan and Gladiator. Good guy Celts are slaughtered by bad guy Romans led by Bad Actor Kiefer Sutherland. A little boy is the lone survivor. Taken to Londonium [ London ] and trained to become a Gladiator. Conan. He is so good, he is sent to Pompeii to fight in the arena. On the way he comes across a damsel in distress and helps her with her wounded horse. Love at first sight. A Roman legion arrives led by guess who? yes bad guy Kiefer Sutherland. Good guy Gladiator wants revenge. Bad guy Kiefer Sutherland has his eye on the damsel in distress, who happens to be the daughter of the headman of Pompeii, but she is in love with good guy Gladiator. Gladiators in Pompeii were the celebrities of the period. Not held in dungeons like in this movie. Also the citizens of Pompeii were Romans themselves,also unlike in this movie. I won't continue with the rest of the story, as i think you should see for yourselves. The acting was terrible, especially by Sutherland. He started with an American accent and then later an English accent. The bad guy characters were like something from an English school Pantomime. As for the disaster itself. Even with the 3d effects, it was not edge of the seat stuff. Unlike Titanic. The story in Titanic was a romance around a disaster, but without the 3d effects, you were glued to the screen. All you see as soon as the eruption comes burning rocks raining down, nothing else. Also it shows people panicking straight away, which is nonsense, because as i was told by the guide, when i visited Pompei, the populace had no idea of what was happening and just stood and watched until the lava started to flow down and even then, they tried to save their belongings. That is why so many perished and also why Versuvius was mistaken for a mountain and there is no word for Vulcanoe in Latin. Also once the smoke connected to to the sky, light pebbles rained down on the city. So for a while, they thought there was no danger. Hollywood has gone downhill in the last 20 years. They blame DVDs for people not going to the cinema, so they make more films in 3d.The standard of acting has gone downhill. There are no stories to their films any more, so they put all these effects in to compensate for this. If you want to see a good DVD about Pompei buy the DVD BBC documentary drama with Tim Piggot Smith called Pompeii The Last Day. On with it is the story about the Colosseum, called Colosseum A Gladiators Story.If you want to see a good fictional story centering around the disaster, get the TV Miniseries The Last Days Of Pompeii starring Lawrence Olivier, Anthony Quayle, Ernest Borgnine, Barbera Carrera and a host of others. I hope i have not bored you with this review, but i don't like to waste money and i am sure you don't.",negative
Pompeii,"I would want to say that this film feels different, yet somehow it felt  familiar. The film felt different thanks to the climactic volcanic  eruption, which added an extra dimension to the final act, yet in every  other minor plot detail, it felt as if I've seen the act many times  before. Overall, though, it is a joy to watch, despite the minor flaws  throughout the film.  One strong point in which I enjoy the film were the action sequences,  which mostly are very practical sword fights, that turns out to be  quite fun and enjoyable with the fast & swift hits. And then throughout  the end, the suspense of the danger can be felt, which I attribute  mostly to the decent soundtrack. Soundtracks which are supportive  towards the appropriate situation is always a great thing to have. And  while the visual effects were not perfect, it didn't really matter in  terms of the overall experience.  Yet the film is dragged down by minor flaws along the way. There was no  humour in the mix, and while there is no deep emotional drama as well,  at least I can still feel for the character. There are times where I  felt that the scenes were not supposed to happen yet, although in the  end, I could at least care about what's going to happen to these  characters. And the closing scenes were too abrupt, where they could  instead have added some finishing lines/quotes or maybe give some  aftermath/future scenes. These minor details kind of let down what  would otherwise be a solid thrilling disaster film.  VERDICT:  Good: Great action sequences, Decent soundtrack & suspense  Bad: No humour, Lack of emotional touches, Abrupt ending, (Minor flaws)  SCORE: 7.0",positive
A Monster Calls,"This movie will give words to your grief. It will open you up, lay you bare, and take out that little pack of grief inside you, hold it up against light and show you how it looks from up close. What its made of. What is its texture. It will give a name to your feelings, a face to your emotions. Give yourselves this movie's insight.What NOT to assume about the movie: Do not take this movie by its name. Or its trailer. This is not a kids' movie. Its a child's story. Do not take it as an attempt at a tear jerker. Do not take it as a run-of-the-mill art movie. Do not take it as anything you have seen before. It WILL shake you. Your insides. Your core. Your hands will not move to fast forward once, even when there is no action and no flashy fight scenes. Beware, in the era of more visuals than substance, your ears will surprisingly listen. Your eyes will watch. You will want to know what happens, and how, even when you know it. The emotions are the most red form of raw. They have been wrenched apart from real life and placed in front of the camera as they were. The actors, for this brilliance, deserve a thank you beyond the scope of my expression. This movie holds a different meaning for everyone. If you have never felt personal grief, it will shock you by what its like when the stakes are high. If you have personally suffered, you will find yourself saying 'oh this is so true.this is how it was.'Thats how it was for me, who has lost dear ones personally, and my husband, who hasn't. When Conor's truth was revealed, my husband gasped 'how could he?' while I smiled painfully, understanding exactly what Conor meant.

Not because it's perfect but because it touched you personally.A Monster Calls tells a story about a boy named Conor who has to cope with his mom's illness while going through his adolescence. Sounds like a typical coming-of-age story, but it's not. Bayona has created one of a kind, exquisite, complex and profound story for all ages while at the same time didn't forget to look gorgeous (I'd totally buy their watercolor artworks) and well-acted. The most impressive part of the movie for me wasn't the technicality but the emotion and imagination involved while creating this.But at the end of the day, Bayona won me over simply by reminding us all that sometimes it's when you hold something closest to you that you're finally able to let it go.",positive
Kung Fu Panda 3,"Well this is the third Panda movie where this central question leads to the climax. While this may seem rather repetitious, it bears repeating. Can the viewers actually take this message to heart and apply it to their own lives, we'll see wont we.Focusing on ""who we are"" is profoundly important and like an onion each of us has multiple layers so does Po the Panda. While it does include kicking a$$ and stopping bad guys, there are other dimensions which go beyond that, like allowing others to be who they are too.Jack Black and crew do the same great job as the other two movies.

The team then learn through research that Kai was Grand Master Oogway's old friend who fought with him long ago, but was banished to the spirit realm for 500 years when he grew thirsty for the power of chi. Kai can only be defeated by a master of true chi, which they discover was an innate ability of the panda colonies. Po, at Li's suggestion, along with Mr. Ping, travels to the secret village where the pandas hide while Shifu and the Furious Five stay behind to investigate Kai's movements and defend the Palace. Although Po is eager to learn chi, he first learns the life of a panda in the village, which he feels grateful to be a part of.After learning that all the Kung Fu masters are missing, Master Shifu sends Crane and Mantis to find them. Crane and Mantis join with other Kung Fu masters to confront Kai, but they all have their chi stolen. Kai then arrives at the Jade Palace and destroys it, then takes everybody's chi while Tigress escaped to find Po and warns him of the upcoming danger. Afraid, Li and the pandas prepare to run away. When Po demands that his father teaches him chi, he reveals that they had all forgotten chi, and he only wanted to save Po from Kai's wrath. Hurt over his father's misdirection, Po isolates himself and trains vigorously to confront Kai. Mr. Ping then comforts Li and admits he was initially worried Po would be taken away from him, but came to realize that Li being a part of Po's life simply added to his happiness, and that they should stay by Po's side as family.Tigress confronts Po and tells him that he cannot defeat Kai without continuing to discover the secret of chi, during which Po confesses that the experience has him once more doubting his potential. Li and the villagers, having decided to stay, ask Po to train them so they can fight back. Po agrees and teaches them using their everyday activities as their assets and begins their plan to save their village. Kai arrives and sends his minions to capture Po, but they are held off by the pandas and Tigress, distracting Kai. The plan works, but ultimately fails when Po tries to use the Wuxi Finger hold on Kai, who reveals that it won't work on spirits. Kai gains the upper hand in their fight, but in a last-ditch effort, Po uses the Wuxi Finger Hold on himself while grabbing onto Kai, sending them both to the spirit realm. They fight again, but Kai defeats Po and prepares to steal his chi. Using what they learned from Po and about who they are, Li, Tigress, Mr. Ping and the pandas are able to use their chi to save him. Po, with the chi flow, suddenly generates a golden dragon-shaped avatar around him and destroys Kai by overloading him with his chi, freeing all of the Kung Fu masters in the process.In an ethereal golden pond, Grand Master Oogway appears to Po, and informs him his journey has come full circle, revealing his role by selecting Po as Dragon Warrior is also because of his descent from the ancient pandas, and his embodiment of the yin-yang. He also reveals his role in alerting Li of Po's survival, and expresses his happiness to Po about how much he has grown. By choice, Po wields a mystic green staff bestowed by Oogway to return to the mortal world. Everyone returns to the Jade Palace, where Po proudly gazes upon his family, friends, and legacy in the spot where his journey began.",positive
Penguins of Madagascar,"While everyone else in the world adores penguins, there is one group out to destroy their cuteness. Their name is... Dreamworks Studios. Even though skipper, kowalski, rico, and private are amazing characters, combining the elements of penguin cuteness, sophisticated humor, and slapstick comedy, this movie certainly did not uphold those previous character elements. The first part of the movie is a nice introduction to how the penguins became who they are now and gave a nice backstory. However, the rest of the movie (to put it lightly), sucked REALLY bad. This was easily the worst Dreamworks movie I had ever seen. The main villain looks like a cartoon version of a Tim Burton character, the plot is meaningless, and the jokes are few and far between. They could have made countless jokes about fracking, global warming, oil spills and the countless other environmental problems we have today. They could've gotten morgan freeman to do the introduction, they could have had a few cameos from the other madagascar characters. (SPOLIER SENTENCE NEXT) But instead, the main villain was an octopus that was jealous of how cute the penguins were so he captured them all and tried to turn them ugly. So they partnered up with four one dimensional secret agent characters who somehow have millions of dollars. Care to elaborate on those characters? Can we have an introduction? Maybe just something? No? Okay. I'm sorry but what a waste. Seriously the transformers movies have a comparable plot. Wait did I just say that? Sparknotes: Do yourself a favor and don't go see this movie. It honestly spoiled the Madagascar franchise for me. SERIOUSLY IT SUCKED",negative
Penguins of Madagascar,"This is masterpiece. Being 20 years old guy, i still like to watching this cartoon. Sometimes my 40 y\o father when have a time watch this. It's really funny cartoon where are different stories, like about love, about friendship, about action, about moral values! Each character full of their life way!Skipper-Team leader. Always keeps team in healthy shape. Always says what to do and how to do. He use his ""King slap"" to calm down members of team. It's really funny and by this he emphasizes his leadership. And it is ridiculous in my opinion, is when he says the name of the operation. ""Okay guys, we start operation ""******"" Let's go!"" (c) Skipper. Ahahahah :D Kowalski-Brain of team. He always have plan. Always! True scientist! His inventions strange but very interesting :D Scientist's language very funny. When Kowalski start to explain something, it's line OMG, wut :DD Which makes it really funny :) In many movies\cartoons in every team must be clever guy, i think in penguins it depicts the most fun, cool and exciting!Rico-""Mad KABOOM Guy"" I gave him this name :) Very strange one, which makes him very special in this team. He can only speak a few words, and the rest he can only make sounds. That's what makes him special :) Really funny guy :) YOu should watch him and u will understand me :))Private-cutie of team. Very friendly one :) He always finds in people's kindness and honesty (with Skipper all the way around). When Skipper see potential enemy, Private meanwhile trying friend with him :) Hahaha :) So cute one ;)What about another guys in Zoo. I just wanna say Dreamworks have very good taste!!! All personage are amazing! I cant imagine them in another taste's! Keep doing Dreamworks! I love you!!10\10!!!!! <3PS. Sorry for low English :)",positive
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,"It was inevitable that the sequel would be imminent out within a couple of years to keep the memories of the first film fresh in people's minds.But my memories of that film were of this reboot being a complete waste of time, but with a decent set piece involving snow, and nothing more than a Michael Bay produced cash machine with no soul.The turtles face a new challenge when Shredder escapes from custody and joins forces with Baxter Stockman, a mad scientist who plans to use a serum to take over the world. Along for the ride are Bebop and Rocksteady, two dimwitted henchmen who provide plenty of muscle. Luckily, the turtles have their own allies in April O'Neil, Vernon Fenwick and Casey Jones, a hockey-masked vigilante...... As the pizza-loving heroes prepare for battle, the notorious Krang also emerges to pose an even greater threat.And this time it's pretty much the same, apart from the fact that there isn't a decent set piece in its ridiculously long running time, in fact, you'd be hard pressed to call this a actual film as it has not coherence, no narrative, it just goes from one place to another, and for a film focusing on giant Ninja Turtles, it's one of the most boring experiences I've had at the cinema this year.It's a CG nightmare, with soulless, hate worthy characters spouting and idiotic script to lifeless looking CG characters with attitude.It's as if Bay has just made one long commercial for toys, cars and clothing, and we've had to pay for the pleasure. But Bay has really outdone himself with this one, it's actually worse than Age Of Exhaustion, and by looking at the box office for this, people are becoming tired of his action movies.Really, if you were a fan of the Turtles back in the day, seek out Secret Of The Ooze, at least it has Vanilla Ice in it.",negative
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,"One year after their battle with the Shredder, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles still live in the shadows, having allowed Vern Fenwick to take the credit for Shredder's defeat. When Shredder is being transferred between prisons by corrections officer Casey Jones, his Foot Clan–operating under the direction of scientist Baxter Stockman–attack the convoy transporting him. The Turtles, tipped off to the escape attempt by April O'Neil, fend them off. Stockman is still able to affect Shredder's escape using a teleportation device, but Shredder is hijacked mid-teleport and winds up in another dimension. There, the alien warlord Krang gives him a mutagenic compound in exchange for his promise to find three components of a machine Krang sent to Earth in ages past, which when united will open a portal to his dimension.Shredder recruits the two criminals that were being transported alongside him, Bebop and Rocksteady, and has Stockman use Krang's mutagen on them to transform them into powerful animal mutants. The snooping April witnesses their transformation, and is able to steal the vial of mutagen. Pursued by the Foot, she is unexpectedly saved by Casey. In the scuffle, the vial is lost and taken into police custody. Donatello deduces that the mutagen could be used to turn the Turtles into humans, enabling them to live normal lives above ground, but Leonardo refuses and insists that he keeps it as a secret from the others. However, Michelangelo overhears their conversation and tells Raphael. Rapheal furiously confronts Leonardo for not telling them about the Retro mutagen and being honest with them, which results in Leonardo benching him and Mikey off the mission. Raph then recruits Mikey, April, Casey, and Vern to break into the NYPD police headquarters to recover the mutagen. But the Foot arrive ahead of them and in the ensuing battle, the Turtles' existence is revealed to the police, who react with fear and hatred. The brothers escape, but April and Casey are arrested.With Shredder's forces having already recovered two of the pieces of the portal device, the Turtles track Bebop and Rocksteady where they have recovered the final piece from a jungle in Foz do Iguaçu at Brazil. The Turtles intercept their jet on its return journey via a plane-to-plane skydive, and although the resultant battle crashes the jet, Bebop and Rocksteady are still able to successfully escape with the final component. The Turtles return to New York just in time to watch as Stockman and Shredder complete the portal device and open the gateway to Krang's dimension, through which his modular war machine, the Technodrome, begins to emerge. Krang immediately betrays Shredder, freezing him and locking him away with his collection of other defeated foes.The Turtles see no way to combat the threat from the shadows and must decide whether or not to take the mutagen and become humans in order to fight openly. Leonardo finally agrees to do as his brothers wish, but Raphael shatters the vial, realizing that they must accept who and what they are. Vern recovers security footage that proves Stockman and Shredder's crimes and secures April and Casey's release, allowing them to facilitate a meeting between the Turtles and police chief Rebecca Vincent. With the acceptance and blessing of the police, the Turtles go into action, confronting Krang aboard the still- assembling Technodrome. Meanwhile, Casey keeps Bebop and Rocksteady busy while April and Vern defeat Shredder's lieutenant Karai and take control of the portal device. Once the Turtles locate the beacon around which the Technodrome is assembling, they hurl it back through the portal, taking Krang and the rest of the Technodrome with it, and April, Casey, and Vern shut the portal down, ultimately defeating the alien, but not before Krang swears he will return for revenge.The Turtles are honored by Vincent and the NYPD, but elect to keep their existence a secret from the public at large, deciding that being normal isn't nearly as fun as being a turtle.",positive
Ferdinand,"Although the story is fairly generic and the jokes mostly fall flat, 'Ferdinand' is still a entertaining family flick that somewhat stands out from the majority of recent animated films thanks to the important themes explored throughout, and its subtle commentary of the bullfighting sport. The film does, however, include a few overlong action set-pieces that drag down the pacing and seem to have only been included to keep hyperactive children engaged (although that is indeed their purpose), but luckily the film doesn't rely on these and instead focusses on delivering its principal ideals. Furthermore, the third act is emotionally powerful and nicely wraps up the character arcs on display, while really hammering home its message. John Powell's music score is fantastic too. 6/10",negative
Ferdinand,"We are a family of animal lovers, especially cows, and we absolutely adored this movie. Ferdinand is the lovable giant who melted us all.",positive
Paddington 2,"To think I had second thoughts about even going to see this ! A perfect film in all ways suitable for all the family for children 8 months to 80 years and beyond . A total delight . Cinema-photography was excellent, giving an interesting nostalgic feel set in modern times , at times you felt you were being transported back to your childhood in the 1950s - 1970s with many aspects such as steam trains and Victorian architecture and prisons - the Hugh Grant Phoenix Buchanan character was almost as if Terry Thomas had been reincarnated to play the role! Shots of Windsor gardens and the Shard juxtapositioned the tourist view of London old and new . The theme of good versus evil reigned supreme throughout . Together with love conquers all and community spirit . Michael Bond the author sadly died in Paddington on the last day of filming never reaching the age of Aunt Sally but at 91 he lived a long life and left us with a masterpiece . The cast was absolutely superb - the animation top notch - you'd forget that Paddington is a bear as did the characters at times - watch the credits right to the end for Hugh camping it up to the max . Superb - you'll love it Pad.A 10/10'",negative
Paddington 2,"I used to read all the Paddington books when I was a small boy and my wife when she was a little girl. We both loved all the crazy escapades that Paddington got into and he did it all with a good heart.I very much enjoyed seeing the first Paddington but did feel it wasn't quite Paddington with the scary woman and the scary scenes.Paddington 2 completely captures the essence of the the books and really wrings out the most of some of the characters.Brendan Gleeson is superb as the 'nasty' Knuckles who quickly warms to Paddington. This might sound far-fetched but the whole film is very childish. Now that's not childish in the sense of ""silly and immature"" but in the other definition of ""appropriate to a child"". The whole film shows and plays scenes as a child might imagine things to be - for example how the prison works and especially the lovely idea that the warden reads the inmates a bedtime story to help them all get to sleep.There are superb performance from all the actors and a huge number of cameos. Even the small scenes put in by the like of Joanna Lumley and Rob Brydon are clearly done with great love from the actors. Hugh Grant puts in a superb over the top performance as the baddie, which really let him flex his vocal talents!The whole film is done in bright colours and with a superb musical backing track. When you are watching the film be careful to pay attention to all the small details, such as the newspaper headlines and the To Do list in the Brown's Kitchen, there a huge number of little jokes in the background and I suspect I'll spot a whole load more when I watch this again on Blu-Ray!Not really spoilers but there is only one really 'scary' scene near the end but it is so beautifully done and you know that Paddington will win so even the little ones won't cry. And make sure you stay for ALL the credits as they play out to an amazing ""what happened after"" montage.I have noticed that that at the time of writing this review there were 927 votes and 15 people have given the film a 1-star. Now I know everyone is entitled to their opinion but in this case I suspect these people might not really understand Paddington and what he's all about, if you have young children and they love Paddington then they will love this film.This film is suitable for young children aged 4 to 104 :)Let you into a secret, when my wife and I went to watch this film there were a lot of people in the cinema but not one was under 18! From the looks of it the audience was aged 20 - 80!I cried and I laughed through the whole film and rekindled my inner Paddington.",positive
Seventh Son,"The hunter of supernatural creatures Master Gregory (Jeff Bridges) traps the queen of the witches Mother Malkin (Julianne Moore) is a pit on the top of a mountain. Years later, she escapes from the pit and Master Gregory and his apprentice Mr. Bradley (Kit Harington) hunt her down. However Mother Malkin kills Mr. Bradley and flees to a derelict castle that she restores with magic. She meets her sister Bony Lizzie (Antje Traue) and her niece Alice (Alicia Vikander) and plans to destroy Master Gregory to begin her kingdom of evil. Meanwhile the old hunter recruits the naive farmer Tom Ward (Ben Barnes), who is the seventh son of the seventh son of the Ward family, to team up with him and his partner Tusk (John DeSantis) to hunt down Mother Malkin. Tom's mother (Olivia Williams), who is secretly a good witch, gives a necklace with a magic stone to protect him. They head to the village where Tom meets Alice and falls in love with her. But what is the true intention of Alice? Will they succeed in destroying the powerful Mother Malkin?""Seventh Son"" is a fantasy film indicated for fans of the genre. The story is full of action, with romance, funny situations and great CGI. There is a cameo of Kit ""Jon Snow"" Harington in the role of Master Gregory's apprentice; the gorgeous Julianne Moore does not seem to age and performs the evil Mother Malkin; Olivia Williams has a minor but important role of the mother and good witch; the Swedish actress Antje Traue, the Ava of ""Ex-Machina"", is very beautiful and talented. However Jeff Bridges disappoints with a weird way of speaking, maybe with the intention of looking older. In the end, ""Seventh Son"" works perfectly well on DVD. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Sétimo Filho"" (""The Seventh Son"")",negative
Seventh Son,"It's not an awful film but if you want to see something new, anything new, then this isn't the film to look at. The production quality is high; things look good. They're shot well and you can see a lot of time and effort went into creating it. But I have to ask, if you're going to put that much time and effort into a project, why not do something new/fresh/unique/original?The narrative is more predictable than a Dungeons and Dragons rulebook and when the description for a monster was presented as a ""level six monster"" I had to take a moment to ensure my jaw wasn't on my lap. The character archetypes walk straight of the pages of any explanation of the Monomyth or Three Act Play. The mentor is a grumpy old man who gets disrespected by everyone but who is 'the most incredible fighter of evil'. The hero is 'the most unlikely candidate' to past the trails of being a Spook. Yes, the greatest warriors against evil are called Spooks – sounds too much like lazy writing to ignore. They have to defeat the 'greatest evil' before the 'blood moon' is full. The most generic fantasy content and lingo.Some of the dialog was also atrocious. In a fight one character comments ""(y)ou know nothing of dragons."" This intimidating comment is either completely useless as there are no other reference to dragons and if it turns out that the flying baddies are dragons then the statement is incorrect as the person the comment was aimed at knows the one quite intimately. Another such comment was ""his reign of terror"". The him that is referred to here holds no station of power beyond the power he claims over any person he faces in single combat, hardly a reign of any kind.The representation of the antagonists was interesting, visually at least. The master assassin couldn't be bothered to do anything sneaky or stealthily. His 'army of assassins' are incorrectly introduced as, well, assassins when really they're just 'random cannon fodder for the slaughter' to fill in the fight scenes between Lieutenants; yes the bad guys (who are witches) have a queen and she has lieutenants. The hero goes through the minimal required amount of character development, just like everyone else. Everyone who has to die, dies on cue. The love interest is a shallow relationship that starts with eye contact and ends with betraying their respective parties at one point or another, with little other than a single make out session in between.I'm looking for a saving grace and I'm having trouble coming up with one. It's like drinking a glass of tap water, not bad but it's not going to tickle your taste buds.",positive
War for the Planet of the Apes,"The third installment in the Planet of the Apes reboot series, 'War for the Planet of the Apes' is a terrific film, that is grim & thought-provoking, and bravely pushes the Blockbuster Genre, by offering more soul than gimmicks. With a Sterling, Oscar-worthy Performance by Andy Serkis as Caesar, the leader of the apes, to a Screenplay that is dark & powerful & Deft Direction, this recent box-office & critical smash is among the year's best films! 'War for the Planet of the Apes' Synopsis: After the apes suffer unimaginable losses, Caesar wrestles with his darker instincts and begins his own mythic quest to avenge his kind.'War for the Planet of the Apes' is a tale on love, hate, revenge & survival. And in a world where Presidents behave like dictators & discriminate the minorities, this Apes versus Humans spell-binder comes close to the current state of times we live in & questions hate & violence with thundering ferocity. 'War for the Planet of the Apes' is brave enough to remain a grim story on a leader broken & consumed in hate, ready to protect his misunderstood tribe by a sadist & ruthless colonel (Woody Harrelson, in an electrifying performance). Its disturbing & powerful story on Caesar's fight, with a mad-load of violence & thought-provoking confrontations, that are SURE to give your goose-pimples. Its power-packed stuff.Mark Bomback & Matt Reeves's Screenplay is excellent. The Writing is super-strong & makes for a solid third installment. Reeves's Direction is intense to the core. This is Reeves at his finest, as a writer & director. Michael Seresin's Cinematography captures the carnage, with astonishing results. William Hoy & Stan Salfas's Editing is top-notch. Art & Costume Design are fantastic. Michael Giacchino's Score is enchanting, as always. Performance-Wise: Andy Serkis needs to be awarded. His return as Caesar in a yet another motion-capture performance, defines emotion. Serkis is simply superb, enacting the bruised & broken hero with gut-wrenching honesty. Has the Academy been sleeping? I mean, how can one not include Serkis in the finest performances of the year? Give him his due, Nominate Serkis for his impeccable work in 'War for the Planet of the Apes', it would only prove to be a rich moment in your history. Second in command is Woody Harrelson, who puts the screen on fire. In one of his scariest roles, the Thespian portrays a villain that's hard to forget. The TREMENDOUS Steve Zahn is extraordinary & adds the much needed relief in the intense proceedings. Karin Konoval, also, is marvelous. Rest lend incredible support.On the whole, 'War for the Planet of the Apes' is A Mighty Winner! Don't Miss It.",negative
War for the Planet of the Apes,"A quick look at the bad reviews shows that most of them were written around the same time, mid July 2017 and most all of them are 1 star ratings, an obvious attack on the movie makers and nothing to do with the quality of the film. I urge you to ignore these fake reviews and read instead those written after the summer of 2017!",positive
Finding Dory,"What can I say? Maybe I'm just becoming a curmudgeon but I just don't find the fact that Dory lost her parents as a child and has been looking for them ever since very (read: at all) interesting. The movie opens with Dory as a small child, who features in several flashbacks thereafter. The cuteness factor of young Dory has been dialed up to 11 in a rather obvious attempt to invest the audience in Dory's plight that much more. But, to me, it just came off as saccharine.The movie wasn't very plausible either. Yes, I am fully aware this is a cartoon aimed at kids. But we're expected to believe Dory, having severe (and entirely plot-driven) memory loss somehow found her way as a small child from California all the way to Australia all by herself.Anyway, if I'd been able to find the basic plot interesting, I might have forgiven the movie's list of other other implausibilities and errors but, as it is, they just come off as irritating, and in service of a dull story. Some example:An octopus (actually, a ""septapus"", as it's missing a tentacle; more on that later) that can not only stay out of water indefinitely and disguise itself as anything, but can also learn to drive a car within seconds and drive it blind with only Dory to guide him.A fish tank in the kiddie section of an aquarium, where the kids are allowed to grab the creatures within the tank. This, incidentally, is where the octopus lost a tentacle because a kid pulled it off. And the aquarium was totally okay with this and let the kids go on grabbing fish. GTFOOH Pixar.The octopus finds himself back in the tank where kids can freely grab them. Conveniently, he forgets he can essentially become invisible, to force tension into the plotThe octopus steers a stroller past milling throngs of people, none of whom think it very remarkable.Whale sharks are not whales and do not eat fish. This is the most egregious, or at least most irritating, error committed by this film. Did Pixar not do research or did they just not care? Honestly, I find this error shocking coming from Pixar.Several fish-eating animals are seen throughout this movie that are only to happy to forget their dietary requirements: sea lions, loons, otters, it doesn't matter. The otters are even willing to risk their lives for this fish they don't know to help her do something about which they have no way of knowing anything. At least in the fIrst movie, there was some explanation given as to why pelicans and sharks would not eat fish. Here, it's just whatever serves the plot. It just feels lazy and cheap.I have a feeling echolocation doesn't work anything like it's portrayed here, but I won't make too much of it. But, wow, did that ""whale speak"" get REALLY annoying REALLY fast.I have usually considered Pixar to feature strong characters, but after THE GOOD DINOSAUR and this movie, I'm disappointed in how dull and/or annoying the characters are. Dory was fine as a supporting player (and in a better movie) but as the star, she's simply insufferable. Overall, I have always considered Pixar as synonymous with quality. But no longer. It will no longer be a given that a Pixar movie is going to be a winner.",negative
Finding Dory,"I have to admit that I was among many who rolled their eyes when a sequel to Finding Nemo was announced. I really didn't think there was anything else that could be done with that story. WRONG! It was honestly a million times better than I ever could have expected. I definitely loved it more than the original Finding Nemo. Dory was a fan favorite in the original film and the sequel delivers more of Ellen's whimsical portrayal of the forgetful little fish.I am a sucker for backstory (main reason I love the Star Wars prequels) and I absolutely loved the direction they took this film in. Fun for the whole family. Laughs, lessons, tons of heart. Who could ask for more? The voice acting cast was tremendous, particularly Ellen, of course. They really know how to pull you into this undersea world. I really wouldn't have changed anything about it. A truly delightful movie.",positive
RED 2,"This sequel sees retired agents Frank Moses and Marvin Boggs in trouble again when an article on Wikileaks mentions them in connection to a Cold War mission known as 'Operation Nightshade'. Shortly after Marvin warns Frank he is apparently killed and Frank is captured and is threatened by Jack Horton who says he will torture his girlfriend, Sarah, if he doesn't say what he knows about Nightshade. Before long he is rescued by the not so dead Marvin and the two of them, along with Sarah, head off to find out the truth behind Nightshade. It won't be easy though; the CIA have hired contract killer Han Cho-Bai to hunt them down and MI6 has asked their old friend Victoria to hunt them down. The story will take them to Paris, London and Moscow and will involve finding a long hidden nuclear weapon. The protagonists will find themselves working with some unlikely allies and one of the people they trust prove to be the most dangerous.Anybody wanting a gritty action thriller will be disappointed; as with the first film there is lots of action and plenty of thrills but it was definitely a comedy even the scene where somebody is dissolved in an acid bath is played for laughs. The action is delightfully over the top with lots of shooting, fighting, chases and an explosive finale. The cast does a fine job with Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, John Malkovich and Mary-Louise Parker make welcome returns and are joined by the likes of Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Byung Hun Lee all of whom bring something good to the proceedings. While the action is fairly bloodless there is a high body count which some viewers doesn't sit well with all the comedy and the child-friendly UK '12' certificate personally I doubt it will offend many people as the action is of the 'James Bond' style. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of action who don't want anything unpleasant in general and fans of the first film in particular I certainly enjoyed it.",negative
RED 2,"This film is about the missions of a bunch of retired ex-spies who are still extremely dangerous.It's refreshing to have an action comedy! It's not easy to have all the killings and explosions happening, and yet maintaining a light hearted and fun tone. ""Red 2"" succeeds again in reaching the balance, making it enjoyable and fun. There are many cool scenes such as Helen Mirren firing guns with both hands towards opposite directions from a car. Mary Louise Parker's character is also fun, she seems not to know how to do anything but she is still so cool and funny. It's nice to see an action film having a big female presence, it's such a pleasant change. All the characters I enjoyed watching ""Red 2"", and maybe there will be another sequel?",positive
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Seriously, Michael Bay & Co. should pay me for sitting through this ridiculous pile of tripe.Grew up with the comics and cartoon show, loved the 1990 movie. Every sense I possess was repeatedly violated with this poor excuse of a greedy cash grab and pizza hut endorsement.I knew not to expect, well, anything really that has Michael Bay's name attached to it, but somehow still managed to be surprised at the sheer badness.The turtles themselves look strange, and act strange. Michaleangelo is like some weird semi-gangsta who is downright creepy in a continuing reference obsession with April O'Neil. Raphael is aloof, but exists little beyond that. That's as far as they went trying to define either one of them. Leonardo, the brave leader, was completely robbed of his personality, characteristics, leadership and anything that would define him, and has always in the past. He is instead a dissolved Bouillon cube in a large pot of water....bland, bland, bland. His voice (Johnny Knoxville) is miscast, and would've been better befitting either Mikey or Raph...that is if they'd bothered to give them any personality.The biggest violations however, lay with Donatello and Splinter, as it seems they thought that hyper-charging the characters would somehow make them interesting, endearing or watchable. ""Donatello does machines"" translates into exploiting him as a constant, textbook, super nerd. And he does absolutely nothing beyond that. Also, he looks like a Ghostbuster. Say hi to Dr. Donatello Stantz. Instead of making Splinter the wise, insightful, deep, sensei he always has been, he's instead to a cardboard cutout that does a lot of ""action stuff"". Don't get me wrong, the Splinter of the cartoon and comics could certainly hold his own, but violence was always the last resort, and had a rationale. (reminds me of what they did to Yoda in the Star Wars prequels.) And he learns Ninjitsu from a book in the sewer, gone is any mysticism or any pivotal, emotional, or vital connection to important characters in the story.Shredder is lame. There's no other way to put it. He is also a hyper charged extension ""more blades piled on the suit will make him better!"" He is unrecognizable beyond the pile of CGI blades, has no depth, no real motivation, and feels needlessly shoe horned into the ""story"" Especially since they terminated any connection with Splinter, or the long important history between them. (by the way, welcome to ""plot convenience playhouse"" when you find out that the turtles and Splinter were pets of April's when she was a girl. How convenient. The biggest human violation is no doubt Megan Fox, who continues to show she's a vapid, terrible actress, incapable of emotion, facial expressions, or the ability to close her mouth. She's absolutely terrible and is no April O'Neil. Michael Bay continues to have an obsession with Megan Fox like you would not believe. She also has no class, instead of choosing to take criticism constructively and look to improving herself and growing into a mature, capable lady, she instead publicly insults any who bashes this movie; (rightfully so) by saying ""f**k you"". Real mature Megan, and a great example for your children.The best actor of the bunch, William Fichtner. I'm still trying to figure out what purpose he served and why he's in this movie to begin with, I keep looking, but...folks, I got nothing' (why is Will Arnett even here?)There's also some defiance of physics as a mountain the size of Everest is apparently located not too far outside NYC, complete with a truck that slides down the side of it for ten straight minutes, with fast paced, confusing, unimpressive special effects. The turtles are ridiculously bullet-proof (which leads me to why are the foot soldiers carrying machine guns? Or any guns for that matter?) The answer I came up with: lazy. Why bother to have some Ninjitsu students, or experts, or extras, in your Ninja movie, when it's easier to have a stunt guy fire a gun. (That or the entire budget went to lame special effects.) Lots of low energy, thick glass shattering, metal side of van punching through escapes that make no sense at all. A yawn inducing, passionless, ""tower rolling down the buildings of NYC"" anti-climatic moments. Lame, just lame.The solution: a marathon of the late 80's cartoon followed by a viewing of the 1990 movie..just to prove that Michael Bay hadn't killed my soul completely. 1/10.",negative
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"I luckily avoid reading opinions before seeing a movie. This movie was a perfect entertainment for the less than 1h50 that it lasts. Although I had enjoyed watching TNMT anime when I was adolescent, I've never been a hardcore fan and it is true that I cannot spot any of the traits that other purists criticized about. What I certainly know is that it was a nice combination of Transformers/Batman/Martial-art material based on a plot that seemed solid and justified. Megan-April was more Megan than April, but she is the right actress for that sort of character. She is not the true red-hair girl I would prefer to see, but she is not less successful than fake blonde J.Alba in Fantastic4, or fake-redhead Scarlett J. in the Avengers. She has the right age and overall stature for the role and she is always fun to watch.The turtles were very versatile and realistic in all ways and I liked that each one got an emphasized ability (or weakness!), differentiating from the anime where all looked quite the same.The action sequences were mind-blowing, synchronized at the ultimate speed the human eye can perceive them. Unlike transformers and other movies where the action and fight are so messy, shaken and difficult to follow that you wished to just skip forward to the outcome, in this case it is absorbing, spectacular and humorous. Which is what all TNMT productions are really about.The music, production design, voices and sound are exactly as they should be to throw you into the screen.It might not be a 10, but in front of all those purists destroying franchises, 10 is the least I could give to hope for at least 2 sequels. And I don't mind who ever purist out there may just avoid it.Don't miss it!",positive
Ender's Game,"Visually stunning, well performed, but my oh my. As a small example, Ender's emails home to his sister, with whom he has a string emotional rapport and which he reads aloud, read like a dry, cold shopping list of what's just happened and what's about to happen. Like so much of the dialogue, they serve the purpose of informing the audience, and *no effort whatsoever* has been made to make it fit in with the story. It's so unbelievably appalling it actually makes you feel like the makers have a personal grudge against their audience. What's more, the movie is brimmed with premises that make no sense - and it relies heavily on these to function. For example, the essential premise that the Formic's ""can't talk"" and so humanity has never attempted communication - yet they a have huge, industrial-sized and highly technical army, that invades far-off planets - so it's clear to everyone from the start that unless they spontaneously do the same thing at the same time, then it's obvious they communicate with one another, and have done so for thousands of years. I'm not kidding - the notion that they communicate *at all* only occurs to Ender right at the end of the movie, in a somewhat forced scene that was thrown in to make the end make sense - and this fact, or the failure of mankind to realise it, is absolutely pivotal to the plot! His commander even denies out loud that it's possible for Formics to communicate - fifty years *after* they launched an invasion on planet earth!Equally bizarrely, the Formics' motivation for invading Earth is that they are about to ""breed themselves into extinction"" (sic). I can barely imagine how lazy and ignorant you have to be to surmise that because overpopulation = bad, therefore overpopulation = extinction. Give it half a moment's thought, heck, even do a little cursory research - it's just not a bright conclusion to reach, is it?Throw in some really uncomfortable lines - you know the ones - establish a strong character for Ben Kingsley (he always shines at these, I think rather he established it for himself) , then give him some throwaway line that serves no purpose except to inform the audience what's going on (again)... oh God, stop it, it hurts!As the final image faded to credits, I actually muttered ""f*** you"" under my breath, because that's truly how I felt. Kind of violated.Do yourself, and the film medium, a favour - TAKE YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE",negative
Ender's Game,"Science fiction started life around the Enlightenment as a conduit for debates about society, about morals and about what makes us human, and what the future might hold, maintaining that same role as our science and technology advanced exponentially over the centuries. Then came its poorer sibling, the sci-fi that was just about the thrills and spills and the effects and action only. The best science fiction of course is a fine blend of the two, of the cerebral and the visceral.One such novel was ""Enders Game"" by the Orson Scott Card, which used the familiar sci-fi cliché of the alien invasion of Earth and the pan- national fight back to examine a very real but troubling dilemma which affects any nation that considers itself to be ""modern"" and ""civilized"", which is that often in order to protect those very things, we, or those entrusted to defend us, have to embrace the opposite of all our values. The young men and women we take and train to kill without hesitation and mercy, to risk death and injury while taking life, then expecting them to return home and be normal. But to abandon that duty of defence may leave our values and our futures at stake, and so by doing nothing lose everything. Is there even a correct answer to this conundrum, and if not then how can we handle the conflict that arises?After many years as ""an unfilmable novel"" it finally arrives as an impressive medium budget movie. Director Gavin Hood, who helmed the mess that was ""X-Men origins: Wolverine"" 4 years ago redeems himself on the sci-fi front by delivering a film that is at once spectacular looking and narratively flowing and gripping, while at the same time not flinching from the dark, sombre heart of the story.The plot takes place 50 years after a devastating attack on Earth by highly evolved Ants called ""Formics"" who were looking for new colonies to deal with their chronic over-population, an invasion repulsed thanks to an ""ID4"" style manoeuvre by legendary pilot Mazer Rackham. What was left of us evolved into a highly advanced, but highly militarised society with interstellar capability and fleets of high tech space cruisers. The military realised that the best minds for strategy where those of children, who were gifted in intuition and daring thought lost in conventional upbringings, and so train the young at tough military academies, selecting the best for officer command. The brightest star is young Ender Wiggin (""Hugo""s Asa Butterfield) who is targeted by chillingly utilitarian General Graff (Harrison Ford) who subjects him to often horrifying mind games, putting him into conflicts with the other cadets around him, isolating him and putting his back ever further to the wall. The only one to help is psychologist Anderson (Viola Davis) who knows that she is complicit in the warping and destruction of the souls of children even if it is to a greater good. He makes enemies but also friends, chief among which is Petra (Hailee Steinfield) When he shows brilliance at the zero gravity team war games, a fight with another cadet ends in tragedy and Ender turns his back on everything, being especially conflicted by the fact that his unique understanding of Formic thought and culture makes him empathise with the very ones he is to destroy. Using his beloved sister Valentine (Abigail Breslin) as leverage, Ender is given command of a fleet positioned off the Formic homeworld, with Petra and his friends as his team, where a massive military build-up is terrifying the veteran top brass into a strategy of all out aggression. Here he is taken under the wing of Mazer Rackham (Ben Kingsley) himself. As the big attack on Formica approaches, Ender begins to feel some of the Formics are trying to communicate with him telepathically. Can peace prevail, or can only one race be left standing? And even if they win, what will be left of the soul of Ender and his team at the end of it?The special effects are impressive, even if most of the ""big battle"" stuff is in the trailer. The excellent cast all do justice to their characters and their struggles, and every part from the major to the minor are well filled and directed. The film also updates the sentiments to our current world, not hiding the obvious fact that we are all living out this dilemma right now but without giving simple answers. ""Star Trek"", which was the modern home of ethical dilemma sci-fi, attempted to grapple with similar questions in this summer's ""reboot"" instalment ""Star Trek into the Darkness"", yet did so with all the clumsiness, lack of skill and tracing paper thin profundity typical of what now calls itself ""Star Trek"". This film on the other hand treats it as the REAL series that Gene Rodenberry created would have. It also evokes thoughts of some of the higher end Japanese Manga and Anime, who use a similar set up and youthful military elite in their dark, ethically troubled tales.Not the fun, exciting happy go lucky movie for kids that some of the marketing suggests, it is instead a deep, warm, troubling, thrilling, moving, spectacular film that is suitable both for adults (despite the juvenile cast) and for teenagers and children (8+) who will hopefully be introduced to the ideas and questions it raises, and will find themselves stimulated to form their own answers, as they must inevitably do some day.",positive
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"There are those who have a deep desire to see beauty and even be part of it. There are also those who are on moral quests. There are people who are excited by the imaginative. If this is you this movie may turn out to be a favorite of yours. The movie is not a retelling of the Don Quixote novel. It's a variation on the themes, the landscapes, the yearnings and other ingredients in the original Spanish source (Cervantes). Universal ideas and conflicts from it are reworked and put in different contexts. Gilliam's best for a long time? We'll see. I would say that it's loftier than he's gone before (but with some low comic touches for sure). There are many storyline twists in 'The Man Who Killed Don Quixote.' In addition, the movie business is satirized (sometimes with a feather, sometimes with a hammer). As for the locations: Gilliam has chosen them with great care; the cinematography does not let his gorgeous choices down. The directing, acting and music are superb. To date, (for me anyway) these are the most memorable film performances by Jonathan Pryce, Adam Driver, and some others in the cast. Pryce is eloquent but above all touching; Driver is perfect as the freaked-out guy who needs to escape the mess. Other characters/actors give me the creeps or fill me with praise for their spot-on nasty or nice performances.",negative
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"Totally bonkers, dreamlike, vintage Gilliam and in the end even Lynchian weird. When it works it's brilliant, when it doesn't, it's baffling and sometimes boring. But even when the script doesn't work, the movie is saved by the incredible cast. It's among both Adam Driver's and Jonathan Pryce best work. Also, I'm in love with Joana Ribeiro.",positive
The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part,"After the very enjoyable first movie and fun looking trailers, I had hope this movie would be good, it wasn't. The movie is filled with cultural references if you have young kids they won't get. The elements of character development aren't really that great, and to be honest I really didn't stop viewing this movie as a commercial like I did in the first film. Anyways, I recommend not seeing this movie in theaters and waiting for it to come out on dvd or digital services.",negative
The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part,"As I accompanied my son to the movies I wasn't expecting much for myself but boy was I wrong. This movie is hands down one of the best animated movies I have watched in a long time if not ever. Funny parts for kids as well as adults, with deep, emotional, heart warming story that makes you think about the movie for a few more days.I see lots of ""critics"" mark this as a toy commercial. It sure may be a commercial but makes you think how such a refreshing story (in a commercial) puts all other animated movies to shame.",positive
Nerve,Don't waste your time. It has an interesting concept and is decent for the first hour...then suddenly it gets dumber than you could ever imagine.,negative
Nerve,"Starring the amazing and very pretty Emma Roberts, and the always charismatic Dave Franco, ""Nerve"" is a new thriller about a high school senior named Venus (Emma) who joins an online community, called Nerve, of adrenaline-junkies where anonymous watchers can dare players to do, well, whatever they want to see someone do. From start to finish, this film is a non-stop white-knuckle thrill ride that is exciting, intense, romantic, and most importantly, a lot of fun. Trust me, you will have a smile on your face the entire runtime of this movie, and you'll also be on the edge of your seat. Now, I'm going to be honest, maybe my low expectations made this movie better to me than it really is, but I can't help that I had an absolute blast watching this film.One thing that was great about this movie was that the dares were realistic, and didn't feel ridiculous. All of the things that Venus is dared to do are things that you know actually could happen in real life. The dares range from her getting a tattoo, to her having to go 60 miles per hour on a motorcycle while the driver, Ian (Dave Franco), is blindfolded, and while the dares get more and more intense as the film goes on, nothing felt overly unbelievable or too exaggerated just for the sake of putting it in the film.And watching Venus and Ian complete their dares and gain money was so much fun to watch. Their chemistry was fantastic, and I bought their friendship throughout the film. What can I say? They made a cute on-screen couple. It was also satisfying to see Venus go from a shy and timid girl to an adrenaline junky, but hey, I'd do the same thing if someone was offering me thousands of dollars. The world building in this film was very believable as well. The game of Nerve felt like a phenomenon, and it actually felt like something that could happen in real life. There were shots of the city that showed the different usernames of all of the different people who were logged into the game, and this was an effective way of conveying just how popular Nerve was in the films universe.The color palette was also hypnotizing. Bright, vibrant, neon reds, blues, and purples are a feast for the eyes, and the soundtrack, which is comprised of light techno music, accompanies and mixes with the colors very well and fits the overall tone of the film.""Nerve"" is a fantastically fun and incredibly intense movie that has great chemistry between Emma Roberts and Dave Franco, great visuals to go with an awesome soundtrack, and cool action sequences in the form of the dares that the characters have to complete. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who just wants to spend an hour and a half gripping their seat with a smile on their face.",positive
The Purge: Anarchy,"Murder is legal during the night of the ""Purge"". Most serial killers are law abiding citizens, just pathetic wannabes. Thanks to the ""Purge"" they can finally live their dream and kill, kill, kill. But there are like-minded souls roaming the streets and a better armed group or a sneaky sniper can stop the nicest killing spree. This is total war, like Verdun, and even the toughest soldiers hated Verdun. So actually only total nut-cases with a death wish would participate in the ""Purge"". Additionally, killing someone you know will make you the prime target of his friends and relatives, it's not ""purging"", it's stirring things up.The first ""Purge""-movie was just a run-of-the-mill home-invasion thriller with a strange background story. The second installment is supposed to flesh out the original concept, except it doesn't, because, well, it really is a very stupid idea. There are a few psychopaths killing the homeless and each other. But the main ""Purge"" participants are: a) Soldiers, sent by the white, Christian fundamentalist government to raise the disappointing ""Purge"" death toll. b) Mercenaries kidnapping random people, so rich, Christian fundamentalist whites can kill them in a save setting. c) Black revolutionaries that fight both groups and save their brothers & sisters. If the main character would have been black, constantly spouting ethnic slurs against whites, it would have been just like the blaxploitation movies from the 1970s. This will doubtlessly happen in part 3, when the revolutionary leader ""The Stranger"" will turn into a ""Shaft""-like savior.Why do people like this hateful and hypocritical trash? Is it a splendid satire on social trends happening in today's USA? Au contraire. If the really rich would want to get rid of the poor, they would start with ending the illegal mass immigration. But instead - of course - they do promote it. No administration likes heavily armed citizens. They want control, not anarchy, no ""Guns are out new gods""-nonsense. Crime is great. If you treat it in a very liberal way, it will flourish until the people will demand all the right things: the abolition of cash, a snoopier and more intrusive police, stricter gun control laws (for non-criminals) ...Is it ""thought-provoking""? Yes, everything that annoying is.Is it a ""gripping suspense thriller""? If you manage to evade the provoked thoughts, you might enjoy the ride. I actually considered part 1 to be a silly, but quite suspenseful ""Assault on Precinct 13""-version. Due to the sheer amount of stupidity in part 2, this time around I wasn't quite up to the challenge, it didn't amuse me at all.250 years ago a prejudice purported that somebody without god would just pillage and murder. As it turned out, there is no such correlation. The ""Purge"" says that without governmental control and persecution people would just pillage and murder. Again: not true. Except for those few poor souls who aren't, we, the people, are much better than that.",negative
The Purge: Anarchy,"How could a sequel to a film that was released exactly one year ago be any good? This was the question I asked myself as I tiredly sat in line pondering whether I should just go home and wait till at the very least, it's theatrical release. Especially considering the first Purge was somewhat of a let down for me. I guess it's because the first one was purely exciting and terrifying because the idea was so perverse. It was the idea that really sold the tickets, but the film itself, seemed to not deliver to the expectations. After watching The Purge: Anarchy, it became very clear why.In the first film, we were sold by all the trailers, which successfully put the idea in our heads, leaving us brainwashed and nightmare-ring about ""what would I do?"" The first film focused on a wealthy neighborhood and a wealthy family with an unlimited supply of resources. A storyline showcasing that all the money in the world couldn't protect them from The Purge But in all honestly, could the average horror viewer relate to that situation or anyone for that matter?This is where the sequel comes in to blow the roof off the first film. Where the first film failed, Purge: Anarchy not only resolves, but also opens up a whole new realm of fear I had not strung together under the circumstances. The sequel puts into perspective the idea of what the purge would look like from multiple story lines that are not only realistic and relatable but are nonstop and completely unpredictable. I was on the edge of my seat the entire film, beginning to end. Very rarely do I get scared once a movie is over, but I was a hot mess on the way home especially coming down from the adrenaline high from being visually anxious for almost 2 hours straight!There were so many things I loved about this film. The characters were all very well written, most of which were wildcards and constantly keeping the audience guessing. I was incredibly impressed that the film knew how to be violent without being gratuitous. There were so many scenes that could have easily been bloody and gross, but they kept it conservative enough that it made you rely on your imagination, which often made the film much more horrifying in my opinion.It's been some time since I got this excited over a film in the theater but I really can't say a single bad thing about this incredible thrill- ride. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND seeing this film ASAP! The sound of that machine gun still haunts me 2 weeks later GO SEE IT NOW!",positive
The BFG,"I was willing to give this movie a chance. It's Steven Spielburg, what could possibly go wrong, right?Well, to be fair, this isn't the WORST movie ever made, but it's one of those waste-of- time movies that just doesn't instill any kind of coherent emotional reaction. I felt nothing during this movie. There was nothing for me to enjoy.The visuals were really phony. I know that a movie like this needs CGI if they wanted it to be live action, but the blending of the two was just AWFUL. Every time Sophie and the BFG were in a scene together I could tell she was sitting in front of a green screen. Most of the film was also whimsy for the sake of whimsy, with the pretty visuals of the sparkly dreams drifting around the fairytale forest landscape serving no function other than to wave pretty colors in the faces of children to keep them entertained. The story meandered. Then they introduced a conflict, which could have added a ticking clock element to the plot. And once I thought it was going somewhere, the plot stopped completely to make for hilarious antics of the BFG in Buckingham Palace. ""Isn't it hilarious that he's giant and everything else is tiny?"" the movie asks. ""No,"" I say. It's not really. Maybe a kid would find it funny, but since I'm not a kid I can't say for sure.""Isn't it funny that he says weird words in the presence of the Queen of England?"" the movie asks. ""No,"" I say again. It's really not. All the humor in this movie falls flat on its face. It's the kind of weirdly delivered humor that I remember movies like The Polar Express have, where there are ""wacky"" characters who do and say things that are not inherently funny, but based on the other characters reactions, the movie tells us that we were supposed to laugh at it. What was the point of the magical fart juice? Other than being true to the book, that is. Seriously, it was the most pointless joke in the movie. The delivery was bad, the timing of it was bad, and the execution of it was bad. The moment the BFG reached for that bottle of fart juice the second time (an hour after the movie introduced it and forgot about it), I had to walk out. That was it for me.I really don't know what else to say other than The BFG was a meandering, pointless waste of time. Nothing was funny, there was almost no tension, the plot goes nowhere, and I left without feeling anything for any of the characters. Maybe a kid of 10 or under would enjoy it, but as an adult in their twenties, I certainly didn't. I walked out of it, so I don't even know if it got better in the last half hour or so.Skip it. Unless you're young and easily entertained.",negative
The BFG,This movie is definitely one to watch with your kids and not only. If you are still a young spirit you can watch it with no fear. It will make you happy! No doubt.,positive
The Last Witch Hunter,"The Last Witch Hunter looks like a pointless mix of ""Blade"" (very cool), ""Hellboy"" (very very cool), ""The Highlander"" (classic), ""Constantine"" (very good), ""The Priest"" (worse), ""Max Payne"" (worst) and the other Gothic-, horror- and fantasy-like movies. The main problem is that the authors put some boring CGI in every scene for no reason. The second is the cast: it is hard to imagine Vin Diesel in the role of a 800-year old immortal hunter. To be honest: the start is hopeful (thanks to the ""13th warrior""...). In the intense first scene he's wearing some badass hair, beard and costume, but in the rest of the movie he is more looking like some Armani-model from a fashion show. He is talking, walking and acting like Dom Toretto. Which means his suffering is unbelievable too. Despite I think Vin is a likable actor and I've really liked him as Riddick. But this character just isn't his type. The others - the young witch, the old witch, the young priest, the old priest - and the whole imaginary world are totally sketchy. Even if they've tried to copy a lot of computer games (for example The last of Us) the result is awful. Very colorful and nice-looking, but empty. And finally: the writers and the script. There is no need for words... The only good thing about the film is Michael Caine: he is funny and good as always. I have a question to the director (the guy who directed the impressive The crazies) Breck Eisner: Why did you do this and why?! You're not Uwe Boll, so stop doing this! No offense. ;)",negative
The Last Witch Hunter,"This movie has garnered a lot of criticism, and to be honest, I'm a little surprised. The plot and CGI were good. The acting and casting was excellent. Some parts of the movie felt really similar to The Exorcist II (Boorman), and I appreciated the lucidity and metaphysics embedded in the plot. I felt like the scene changes and juxtaposing modern/mythical images did a good job of sliding the viewer into the otherworldliness of the script. Most of the criticism seemed to revolve around expectations of Vin Diesels performance. The Character is written tersely for a reason. Why do people expect someone to be Shakespeare, simply because they lived 800 years. That experience might make some people very quiet, and I found Vin Diesel's interpretation believable and appropriate. He isn't portrayed as a scholar or wizard: just a good man who happens to be cursed. Frankly, I don't think most of these people would have been happy with a 20 min monologue by Alan Rickman. The movie was a good fantasy/action movie with some clever plot elements and creative representations of traditional magical elements.",positive
The Interview,"Well, where do we start with this one? Obviously I watched this film knowing what kind of attention had been drawn to it, from crazy Korean hackers, terrorists threatening to bomb theatres to the US president himself. I really hoped that after all the hype it would live up to expectations. And it failed miserably. Cheap humour, jokes and dialogues below criticism most of the time, acting...well, what kind of acting would you expect if the script is not there, the list goes on. Finally, very predictable and flat story, with a major twist easy enough to predict for a 10-year old. But worst of all - the rating. Have you people lost your marbles?! I honestly wanted to give it a 4/10 and before I went on IMDb I was expecting it to be overrated at, say 6/10, but well over 8?! And we're talking over 70 000 votes! This is an insult to cinematography and any intelligent viewer alike that such a piece of garbage should get a score of 8+. It's just unreal. Therefore I'm giving it a 1/10 in a hope that the rating will be quickly brought down to where it actually belongs. It's amazing that only because the film has a political nature, people are willing to rate it so high. Rate it for what it is, don't fool other people into paying to actually see this.",negative
The Interview,"Reading some of these reviews and I find myself looking for a pair of pliers to help some of these people remove the stick out of their ass. To note, I only made an account for this review because I was afraid some people may get the wrong idea about this movie. No, it will not win an Oscar, no it will not have an Oscar winning actor. Was Chevy Chase, Chris Farley, Eddie Murray, Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, Bill Murray, Mike Myers, Will ferrel did a any of them win an Oscar? No, however were their movies not one of the funniest of their time? Exactly. Seth and James will not win an Oscar because the committee doesn't rate comical aspects. However this movie is hilarious. Without being one of the ""typical"" comedy type movies that have come out recently. It's different comical aspects then what has been common in movie cinema in the past year. Obviously it's a comedy, and in the category of comedy movies it will rank as one of the higher ones. When you watch this movie you expect that. It's not a Beautiful Mind or Titanic. It's a comedy, and a damn funny one at that. When you watch a comedy you want to laugh, and this movie will make you laugh. End of story.

Oz the Great and Powerful,"Once again, Hollywood has come out with another horrific ""addition"" to the canon of classic children's stories. This awful prequel should be seen as another blemishment in Sam Raimi's career as a director. Once again, he's splattered cheesy special effects all over the screen in an attempt to impress the audience, but skips out on any type of depth of meaning. He still hasn't figured out that the magic of the movies comes out through the audience becoming engaged with the characters and the storyline, not by being overwhelmed by an over-expansive computer-generated world that looks like its made of plastic. James Franco and Mila Kunis should also be embarrassed by their utter lack of acting in this film. A half-hour into this tragedy and I was ready to leave the theatre. All the characters in the film seem like they're speaking their lines into the camera, probably a result of the fact that everything in the film looks like it was put into the film in post-production. I couldn't help but find it ironic that the screenwriters of Oz have the Kansas magician be tempted by the gold-filled riches of the Emerald City, but find the strength to resist. After viewing the film, all one can think of is how much Roth and Raimi sold out the magical, fantastical world of Oz for the evil riches that came with suckering the poor fans of the imagination of Baum with this over-bloated, horribly-written, poorly acted travesty of a film. They are the ultimate Kansas hucksters. Perhaps they need to look for a little more ""goodness"" and a little less ""greatness.""",negative
Oz the Great and Powerful,"I saw ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" in theaters on it's opening weekend and I loved it. This movie had heart, a good storyline, a well-written script, emotion and some intense moments. It's not as much a prequel to the 1939 classic ""The Wizard of Oz"" as much as it is a reboot of the ""Oz"" franchise that acts as a prequel to the novel ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" by L. Frank Baum (not that I've read the novel). As a reboot, I think it did the source material justice. As a prequel, it actually answered some of my questions. I think the reason some people were disappointed by ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is because they had high expectations for it. I actually had very low expectations going into it and I was surprised by it. I thought it was going to be ""Alice in Wonderland"" but set in Oz and without the only reason to watch it (Johnny Depp). From the trailers and TV spots, it looked like it was made to cash-in with ""Alice in Wonderland"". It was so poorly marketed. But I thought the movie was one thousand times better than ""Alice"". I've seen ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" three times now and I don't see why some people may hate it. Sure it's almost all CG (but then so were ""300"" and ""Avatar"" and no one gave a crap) and the cast consists almost entirely of celebrities (but then again, Judy Garland was a celebrity) so I can sort of understand why it may feel like a turn-off. However, I can't name a bad thing about the movie and most of my friends who have seen it really enjoyed it like I did. While James Franco wasn't the best choice for the Oz character, I think he pulled it off very well. I think it's a much better prequel movie than ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"" was. And I like ""Star Wars"" better than ""Wizard of Oz"" so I think that's saying something. ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" may not be a masterpiece or better than the classic but It's a ""great and powerful"" movie and if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it. Don't listen to the haters. You're opinion is all that matters. I give this movie 10 stars out of 10.",positive
Alice Through the Looking Glass,"Before I shatter this film, I would like to say that I do respect the filmmakers of Hollywood (somewhat). They are creative geniuses that have transcended the art of filmmaking time and time again. They have continuously pushed the boundaries, especially when it comes to bringing astounding visual effects to the big screen.However, the art of storytelling has become lost on them. This is primarily because conglomerates have bought out the studios. A movie is merely a commodity to the shareholders. The question they pose themselves before financing a movie is this: Do we already have a built in audience for this story? If there isn't already a built in audience, good luck getting the film financed. With that being said, it is clear that storytelling is the last priority of Hollywood. Through the Looking Glass is a prime example of this. No matter how many groundbreaking visual effects they throw on the screen, the plot stinks. There was no suspense. Very little irony. No interesting characters. No memorable scenes. No compelling conflict and dynamics between the characters. The entire premise of the film was based on Alice saving the Mad Hatter from his illness. Yet, I could really care less. The story reflects nothing about the human condition. It raises no intriguing questions. Not to mention that the plot itself is aimless and disjointed. It meanders along, zipping in different directions without a clear focus and purpose. One wonders how a script like this even gets greenlit. Maybe this is what audiences have come to accept. Maybe it's our culture that is the problem. However, I won't lay down without making my voice heard. When the credits rolled, I personally booed the film. My girlfriend tried to get me to shut up.Story is a metaphor for life. Compelling characters represent something about each of us. We relate to them on different levels. We witness the actions they take, and say ""Ah, I would've done the same."" or ""Wow. I would've never done that, but I can understand why they did it."" The problem with fantasy films like this is that they are so far disconnected from reality that they literally represent nothing. So I shall pose a challenge to those reading this review who have seen or intend to see this film: watch Alice, then watch a movie like Birdman, The Social Network, Nightcrawler, Fury, or a TV series like Breaking Bad, then compare the two. I guarantee that you'll find yourself much more emotionally fulfilled upon watching one of the films I mentioned. Not all superhero/fantasy films are trash. But Through the Looking Glass was an egregious example of all special effects, but a junk plot.",negative
Alice Through the Looking Glass,"Alice Kingsleigh has spent the past three years following in her father's footsteps and sailing the high seas. Upon her return to London from China, she comes across a difficult decision that may determine what she's going to do during the rest of her life. After re-encountering Absolem, she finds a magical looking glass and returns to the nonsensical realm of Wonderland.Alice discovers that things are going very wrong with the Hatter, who is now acting madder than usual, haunted by past events that he refuses to reveal. In order to prevent a heartbreaking end to her friend, she turns to Time himself. Despite his warnings about Alice not being able to win a race against time, and not being able to change the past, she borrows the Chronosphere, a time device that everyone (including the now banished Red Queen) wants, and winds up returning to the past.As Alice witnesses the hits and misses of friends (and enemies) during their lives, discovering how it prompted them to their current states in the present, she may learn how to solve not only the problem with the Hatter, but her own back in London – but only if she can win the race against the ticking Chronosphere.",positive
Dumbo,"Wow, talk about marketing deception, When i first saw the trailers for Dumbo I was wowed, the magic was there on the screen. However when I actually paid for a ticket to see this movie, I felt as though I had walked into another theater and was duped. This movie was a travesty from the get go. The kid actors were the absolute worst, they were SO ANNOYING. All the actors were miscast, you felt disconnected and there was no magic at all. By far one of the worst Disney remakes in history and one of the worst films of the year. AVOID AT ALL COST!",negative
Dumbo,"I was in tears within the first 10 seconds of the movie. I have a soft spot for Dumbo and Casey Jr is my jam. Danny Devito is a national treasure and can do no wrong. Michael Keaton's character was a delight. Colin Farrell's character could have been better developed , but the kids were his saving grace. I loved the story and the whole world Tim burton creates on the screen. You can see the painstaking detail he puts in every part of the film. The costumes were SUPERB!!! I would have appreciated a bit more back story for the circus folks but all in all Dumbo was the cutest !!! I really think it's a great message against terrible animal cruelty which the original showed as well. The pink elephant scene was imaginative. It is a beautiful film to watch, can't wait to add this to my collection. Please go in with and open mind and heart and let go of unfair expectations. Tim is an artist and artists evolve. This is a collaboration of strange, unusual, and creative minds that wish to share their visions with the world.",positive
Isle of Dogs,"""Isle of Dogs"" (PG-13, 1:41) is a stop-motion animated adventure comedy directed and written by multiple Oscar-nominated auteur Wes Anderson and realized in his distinctive quirky style and with his usual stable of all-star talent. Anderson is best known for films like ""Rushmore"" (1998), ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (2001), ""Moonrise Kingdom"" (2012) and his Best Picture Oscar-nominated ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" (2014), but this isn't Anderson's first animated project. 2009's ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" (also a stop-motion animated comedy) received an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature. Typically unusual and eclectic, Anderson has said that ""Isle of Dogs"" is inspired both by the 1960s and 70s holiday specials produced by Rankin/Bass - and the films of legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa.In the near future, Japan's people are concerned about an overabundance of stray dogs - and the possibility of a rampant canine flu affecting humans. The leader of Megasaki City, Mayor Kobayashi (voiced by Kunichi Nomura), who comes from a long line of cat lovers, signs an order banishing all dogs to Trash Island, starting with Spots (Liev Schreiber), the pet and guardian of the Mayor's orphaned nephew and ward, 12-year-old Atari Kobayashi (Koyu Rankin). Atari then steals an airplane and crash lands (with only minor injuries) on Trash Island when he is discovered and helped by a self-proclaimed ""pack of scary, indestructible alpha dogs"", led by the human-averse Chief (Bryan Cranston) and including the more timid Rex (Edward Norton), King (Bob Balaban), Boss (Bill Murray) and Duke (Jeff Goldblum). As those five dogs fight off other dogs for territory - and some humans sent to retrieve Atari - and then lead him on a dangerous and uncertain cross-island odyssey trying to find Spots (if he's even still alive), there's a lot happening back in Megasaki City. A scientist called Professor Watanabe (Arika Ito), who has an assistant named Yoko Ono (voiced by Yoko Ono), claims that he's perfecting a cure for the dog flu, but the powers-that-be aren't interested (to say the least). Meanwhile, an American exchange student named Tracy Walker (Greta Gerwig), who stands with the city's dog lovers, develops a fascination with Atari's story (as reported on the news) - and an obsession with uncovering what's really going on.""Isle of Dogs"" is creative and attractive, but not very enjoyable. It has Anderson's trademark adorable quirkiness, but the plot is so far-fetched (no pun intended) and irrelevant to anything going on in the world that the whole thing feels like a pretty pointless exercise. Limited cuteness - and quirkiness just for quirkiness' sake - is of limited entertainment value. ""C-""",negative
Isle of Dogs,"I had very high expectations going into Isle of Dogs, being a great admirer of Wes Anderson's work, and especially off the fumes of his previous film, The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). If you look at Wes' filmography, you will notice that each of his films progressively become more focused, detailed, and ""Wes Anderson-ey"". It feels as if his films have been building to a culmination of sorts, which can be represented with Isle of Dogs.The story revolves around a young boy, Atari, who is seeking his lost dog with help from a pack of dogs on Trash Island, right outside of Megasaki City (word-play on Nagasaki), a fictional future city of Japan that is exiling dogs due to a ""canine flu"" outbreak.From a filmmaking viewpoint, Isle of Dogs has it all in spades, and more. The characters are well rounded and relatable, even though the majority of them are dogs. The presentation of the story is very fresh and unique, and the humor is always smoothly intertwined with the narrative and visuals. With a runtime of an hour and 40 minutes, it flies by, always keeping your attention and further engaging you. The stop-motion animation is very well done, and the way it is contrasted with beautiful Japanese imagery is stunning. The soundtrack is also excellent, and aids in telling the story. There are many nods towards Japanese cinema, chiefly Akira Kurosawa's films, which you can tell that Wes has a passion for. The voice cast is star-studded and wonderful as always. There are plenty of twists and surprises, and the film leaves the viewers with some important messages/themes to ponder over. It is best to go into the movie knowing as little about the story as possible, and let it take you on its journey.This film will greatly reward repeat viewings. The attention to detail in every frame is incredible, and there is always so much on the screen to absorb and process, in the best way possible. I believe that Wes Anderson has the most distinct and easily discernible style of any filmmaker to ever live, and this quality alone is something to be praised very highly.If you love dogs, Japanese cinema/culture, stop-motion, and animation in general, then you will love this film all the more so. Isle of Dogs, shows Wes at his full unfiltered creative power, stretching his capabilities, and giving us something truly remarkable.Ineffable Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls052767730/",positive
Jungle,It's a rarity to be able to find a survival movie that is generally boring throughout. But they managed just that. A real shame considering the actors and their performances. I had a hard time staying awake and I'm not one that falls asleep during any movies.,negative
Jungle,"I just caught this film on Amazon Video and I'm kicking myself for not catching this at the movies. I don't think the movie was marketed well when it was released. I was blown away by all aspects of this film and found it hard to hold back my tears towards the end of the film.To an extent it reminded me of Danny Boyle's 127 Hours, but it's a beautifully made film in its own right. It's a survival story so be prepared to see some not so appetising scenes in parts but the pay off is worth it. Towards the end of the film we get to see the real people behind these characters and those photos will stay with you long after you've seen the film.

Allegiant,"I am trying to keep from falling asleep from this boring, stupid, stupid, did I say stupid movie. Asinine, ridiculous, this movie could be renamed, ""How to bore your audience to death"" or ""Movie for braindead corpses"". I feel stupid for watching this so called 'movie'. And I am watching it for free and I still want my money back. Terrorist groups don't need any old torture devices, they can use this movie. Bad acting, check. Stupid plot line, check. Very big, gigantic plot holes that make absolutely no sense, check. You don't care if everyone in the movie does a horrible, painful death, check. Through out the movie you will roll your eyes, sigh heavenly, saying things like ""Why are they doing that?"" and ""That makes no sense."", check. **Spoilers, you knew the one chick was going to die when they got on top of the wall. No bullets hit Tris or Four although they were being shot at at close range and with machine guns, and they didn't get shot as they climbed up the wall. Despite the land outside the wall being completely jacked up from nuclear war, the land is completely toxic, yet people are able to survive on the fridges in tents!!!Where were they getting food and water!!! These people are supposedly exposed to all kinds of toxic fumes, toxic land but they all look normal!!!? Oh, but the Genetic Manipulation place was able to survive the nuclear fall out and create a grass growing (again ON WHAT IF THE WHOLE WORLD IIS A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST!!!) And the motivations for the characters, stupid, stupid, stupid. David, who you KNEW and the new section were evil. Absolutely nothing shocking. You knew who was going to die, you knew who was evil. And why did Four go back to Chicago? And how did he survive walking through the nuclear wasteland with no issues!!

Allegiant,"Upon seeing Allegiant, I had mixed feelings about it. At first upon seeing the reviews I was a little in shocked at how much criticism it was receiving, but sometimes your opinion can be different from the critics who review the movie. So I saw the movie, and as I watched the movie I started remembering scenes from the book, since I haven't read the book in a while. There was scenes that surprise me, which I thoroughly enjoyed because I love surprises. And although, yes the movie strays away from the source material, we as people should be more open-minded about book to film adaptations. As a fan of the books it can be nerve wrecking to have a good book turned into an awful movie, but I like to think about how much time was put into making a film. An actor/actress works hard to follow the script that is given to them, the director has a vision in mind for the film, which is hard work in itself. And putting the film together takes a lot of shots to achieve in the amount of time they are given. This is why we have deleted scenes to begin with. I praise this cast for not giving up on this project and continue to do their best to pull off a movie adaptation of a best- selling series.All in all, I enjoyed this movie and recommend it to people who love stories and fans who can still appreciate a movie despite its obvious changes.",positive
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,"I will preface this by saying that I have not read the books. I did see the first movie and actually enjoyed it. I usually watch movies such as this with a skeptic mind and the first one wasn't bad. This movie, however, was terrible. (Heavy spoilers roasting over an open fire to follow)I've heard that the movie deviates almost unforgivably from the book. If that's the case, I can't speak for the book but the movie script looks to have been written by a high-schooler, at best. The movie is riddled with clichés: Main character with a dark inner battle raging due to prior decisions made (boring!). People (and armies) showing up just at the perfect time (forgivable once, not around the 5th time). Bad guys who couldn't hit a target 20 feet in front of them while shooting an automatic weapon (man those guys suck). And the ultimate ""faked death with poison/paralysis"" scene (wow that whole scene was bad). Throughout the whole movie the main character (the annoying tom-boy girl), Tris, keeps being painted as ""tough"" and ""deadly"". She is neither of these. In fact, she is quite laughably the opposite. Could her personal trainers not put her through some weight-training classes? (Her hairstylist was definitely present as her hair looked like she just stepped out of a Hollywood salon right after the scene where she cut her OWN hair with a pair of rusty scissors....) It looks like she couldn't even do 10 push ups yet she was fighting people and saving people falling over ledges with ease. But she looks like a huge wuss! Her little girly grunts and squeals she made when fighting or doing ""action"" made me bust out laughing. And the scene where she breaks through the glass is meant to be bad-ass and instead just left me hoping she would bounce off the glass and fall flat on her back (man, I wanted to laugh so bad). And probably the most unforgivable part of this whole movie was how POINTLESS everything was. Examples: They fight the faction-less on the train, killing several and doing serious damage to many more (not really sure how because Tris fights like a sissy girl). Then the main character, Four, says his own name and the leader of the vagabonds through bloodied teeth is like, ""Oh we cool bro. Never mind you just head-butted me in the face and killed my friends."" (the Hell??) (Oh and Tris's brother is a huge pussy). They continue to fight hard and kill people to narrowly escape the perfectly- uniformed drone guards of the ""capital"" so that they can go in to hiding. Then the main character just gives herself up. I think it was because the villain was threatening to kill innocent people with her mind control devices (never seen that before), but it doesn't really matter. Then she's given the chance to escape by her double- double crossing 'friend' (didn't see that coming) and yet she chooses to stay to open the mystery divergent box. Well what was the point of anything if you wanted to open it anyway??! I was DYING to contain my frustration. (also, how does the evil capital lady have this perfectly built divergent-box-opening proprietary chamber system, complete with bulletproof glass and mystery-box holding pedestal, just already set up? Does no one question this stuff???)And to top it all off, the super-secret, must-be-preserved-at-all- costs message in the box, (the ENTIRE point of the movie): ""Divergents are cool, don't ostracize them. Oh, and the rest of humanity is living outside the wall. Cheers."" What? No one has bothered to check this whole time?????? Gag.Enough roasting. To conclude, lots of movies, even good ones, have clichés and information that you are just supposed to assume. But this movie was genuinely terrible. Maybe all the people reviewing this with an 7/10+ saw a different movie than I did.",negative
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,"Oh dear god why'd I go see this movie?! If I wanted Hunger Games: Catching Fire, I should've went to see Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Wait! No, I take that back.

The good old days where if you went to see a movie set in a dystopian future where a corrupt government put its citizenry in peril on a whim, it was rated R because it contained great special effects, gritty foul language laced dialogue, and contained adult themes. But this! Okay! I understand the concept of movie studios dumbing this type of film down so tweens can partake in something that makes them feel like they are cool, or makes them feel like their rebelling.Even though they aren't really, they're just soaking up things that have been rehashed from what was cool 25+ years ago.

The Kings of Summer,"The concept of this story has merit, however the execution is well off the mark in all respects. The story progression seems extremely rushed, partly due to the amount of unnecessary scenes and dialogue that have been afforded to cameo characters at various points. Some of the dialogue has comedic value, but for the most it's just basic.I think more time needed to be given to develop the main characters and to develop the plot, rather than to random scenes which hold no real relevance to either. The cosmetics which help keep everything believable were ignored in some respects. Simple things, like how do they store their shop bought chickens without refrigeration, where did they pull architect designs for their house from, why were there fireworks going off in the middle of the bush at night in the swimming scenes, was it necessary for the almost pre-pubescent boys to sprout obviously fake beards and random violin playing in the middle of the forest?

The Kings of Summer,"I love coming of age movies and I love to laugh. In my 17 years I have never seen a movie that has appealed to me so entirely. You can't go into this expecting anything too serious, I think that is the issue that most negative reviewers had. While there are some significant themes here, Kings of Summer is not The Shawshank Redemption. This is not because it fails as a movie, but because it does not try to be anything more than what it is. This is a film that is meant to be a humorous look into the lives of a couple of teenagers. I think there is a tendency among many ""movie-nuts"" to believe that the only good movies are those that depress you or involve some very dark themes. I guess what I am saying is to go in with an open mind, and just enjoy yourself. Anyone who doesn't feel a bit better leaving this movie than when entering it is obviously trying too hard to be critical. Let go, have a laugh, join the three Kings of Summer.",positive
The Lego Movie,"Boasting a killer sense of humor and a surprising amount of heart, The Lego Movie is a film that is not just made for kids. It's made with the those small, colored building blocks in mind, easily bringing memories to life for the adult who played with Legos growing up.It's the underdog tale of Emit Brickowski (Chris Pratt), a standard mini-figure construction worker. Emit, like everyone in his city, lives his life based on instructions drawn up by Lord Business's (Will Ferrell) all encompassing corporation in the sky. When it's discovered that Emit is a prophesied savior of the world, called ""The Special,"" he must prepare to become a ""Master Builder"" to defeat Lord Business before he freezes the whole world. Along the way, Emit gets help from a tough as nails female mini figure, WyldStyle (Elizabeth Banks), a wise but blind wizard named Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), and Batman (Will Arnett), along with scores of other familiar characters and faces.The film has a super fast pace, with many layers of humor that will keep you laughing and engaged the whole time. Pratt (Her) breathes life into Emit as a manic ""Everyman"" character that you root for, as well as relate to. Arnett's Batman is an uber Alfa male, and every line he utters is quotable and hilarious. As the villain, Ferrell is fun, and with a surprising twist in the story, his performance becomes the heart and soul of the film.Unfortunately, there's a lack of female influences in the characters of The Lego Movie. Banks (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) does a fine job bringing WyldStyle to life, and she represents everything a strong independent woman should be. Alison Brie (Community) plays a My Little Pony hybrid creature named Unikitty who is sugar and spice and everything nice, but she does not truly represent another female character, as ultimately she is more of an abstract idea of a character. There are a few brief moments with Wonder Woman (Cobie Smulders), however she is overshadowed by the machismo and gruff of Batman. It would have been lovely to see Wonder Woman work side by side with the male heroes to save the world, but she is regulated to cameo status.A combination of stop motion and CGI animation, the film is visually brilliant. The detail that has been taken to create this universe is astounding. You watch as entire worlds are destroyed in a flash with red, orange, and white Lego brick flames, only to see them built up again. The film is worth the 3D ticket as it enhances the experience and gives the visuals more depth.The Lego Movie is a pure delight. It's everything a humorous movie should be- visual, funny, and touching. It's been made for all audiences to enjoy. Bring the kids,but don't be surprised if you end up loving it more.-stina@mediumraretv.org www.mediumraretv.org",negative
The Lego Movie,"The stand out feature of the Lego Movie for me would be the way the Lego Universe was created. The movie paid great attention to detail making everything appear as it would made from Lego, including the water and clouds, and the surfaces people walked on all had the circles sticking upwards a Lego piece would have. Combined with all the yellow faces, and Lego part during building, I was convinced action took place in the Lego Universe.A combination of adult and child friendly humour should entertain all, the movie has done well to ensure audiences of all ages are catered to. The voice cast were excellent, especially Liam Neeson's split personality police officer, making the 2 personalities sound distinctive, and giving his Bad Cop the usual Liam Neeson tough guy. The plot is about resisting an over-controlling ruler, highlighted by the name of the hero's ""resistance piece"". It is well thought through, well written, and revealing at the right times. Full of surprises, The Lego Movie won't let You see what's coming. Best animated film since Wreck it Ralph! Please let there be sequels.",positive
Pan,"Pan is one of those films where it's hard to pinpoint what is wrong because the answer is basically everything. I'm confused as to how they managed to turn such a simple story into such a convoluted mess.At his core, Peter Pan is just a boy who escapes to a magical fantasy land because he doesn't want to grow up. In Neverland he leads a crew of similarly disenfranchised kids, plays games with Indians, swims with mermaids, and fights pirates.Simple right? Well not according to Joe Wright and the producers of this film. For some reason they felt the need to cram in every single cliché possible in order to 'modernize' the story despite the fact that the themes in Barrie's stories were already timeless.Levi Miller stumbles here and there but he was well cast as Peter. However the script doesn't support the role. At certain points he becomes secondary in his own story. His desires don't move the plot forward and after the first 20 minutes he has very little to do except ""learn how to fly"". We never seem him turn into the character we know as Peter Pan except for the fact that *spoilers* he flies at the end. And don't even get me started on 'The Chosen One' thing.Tiger Lily, played by Rooney Mara, is bland, and I'm not talking about the color of her skin. She's your typical warrior princess and for some reason they try to set up a possible romance between her and Hook. She's basically around to be walking talking exposition.Jackman also does a good job, but his character, Blackbeard, isn't interesting. His motivations are paper thin. He wants to mine some fairy dust in order to live forever which doesn't even make sense because Neverland supposed to be a place where people don't age. Blackbeard is just shoehorned in there so they could have a villain other than Hook.This brings me to one of the most pointless things in the film: Hook being Peter's ally. It doesn't amount to anything. You never get a sense of conflict between the two. You keep waiting for a point when Hook is going to betray Peter but it never happens. You want to see that scene where Peter cuts off his hand and feeds it to the crock, but it never happens. Hook's only motivation in this film is to escape and go home. He doesn't seem like he could turn into the devious Captain we know. At the end of the film, Hook and Pan are still friends and they just hint at a possible conflict in the sequel with a throw away line. Also, if you're a kid and this is your introduction to the character of Hook the 'twist' will go right over your head.And why is Hook American? Who made this decision? Another problem with Pan is the over-use and reliance of CGI. It looks fake, especially Peter's flying. Peter Pan was better animated in 1953, not in terms of graphical fidelity, but in motion. He had weight, he had grace, and he was agile. In Pan he just kind of floats like he's being dragged by a mouse cursor.When you stretch the rules of reality too far it becomes unbelievable even in a world like Neverland. You have to have rules. In Pan there are flying pirate ships. Why? How do they fly? It's never explained. The ships can fly both in the real world and Neverland. There is no consistency.I'm giving this film a 1 out of 10 because they squandered so much potential. The source material is so rich and this is the best they could come up with? I think a live action Peter Pan film could be successful but if they ignore the themes that make the story interesting in the first place it just won't resonate with the audience.",negative

Despicable Me 3,"Despicable Me 3This movie was weighed down by a lot of problems, but before I get to that I will say that I did not hate this film by any means, it's just not very good.Problems:1. The whole ""brother"" concept is good, but it shouldn't have been set up in this movie. It should have been set up in the first one, or the end of the second at the latest.2. This problem I refer to as ""the politics of film,"" because the studio did not acknowledge that they are going to far with this series. The minions stole the show in the first one, however the studio kept pushing it on audiences by over-commercializing them. They somehow became the face of Illumination Studios, and they somehow managed to get their own unnecessary origin story movie. Universal should've stopped while they were ahead with the first Despicable Me. 3. I do not like it when a series will reuse jokes, in this case the ""unicorn being so fluffy I'm going to die."" It was funny in the first one, but in this one it felt forced.4. The villain, Balthazar Bratt, felt way too underdeveloped. He got about four minutes of an origin, which resulted in vague motivations and just another generic, one-off villain.Overall: Save yourself from this mess",negative

Everyone has a different idea of what a movie should be. This one is NOT a typical ""end of times"" movie. It doesn't lay out exactly what is happening as it happens, bringing with it what I saw as a more realistic perspective of how things might be in such times.... no communications, no power, sudden chaos.

I actually didn't mind the very, very beginning of the movie. I thought it was fun. It all went downhill from there.The next few scenes slightly follow the book in a way that it is good enough to pass.Then you get to the oracle where Percy learns his destiny. THEY DIDN'T EVEN FOLLOW THE MYTHOLOGY! They said that Cronos swallowed all of his kids EXCEPT Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. Then they chopped him up. Those who don't know, he swallows all of his kids except Zeus who is taken away until he's old enough to trick his father into throwing up all of his kids and they - depending on the version - castrate, or chop up their father.They then proceeded that at the demigod's 20th birthday (I can't complain too much, Logan Lerman can't pass as a thirteen year old) he shall either save or destroy Olympus.Setting out on the quest, to save Thalia's tree, with Annabeth, Tyson AND Grover, who we know is in Polyphemus' lair, stalling their marriage. Grover is kidnapped and sent to Polyphemus who we later see, slightly following the book, dressed as a woman, pretending to be a maid. They don't know where Luke is, who is the one who captured Grover, so they go to see his Dad, Hermes, at the Demigod post office.They learn he's on a boat, they leave, find the boat, and they're stuck. When they do escape, they go into the sea of monsters and get swallowed by the first monster they come by in the book. Meeting Clarisse down there. They escape together and finally get to an island.In the book, Polyphemus lives on a nice island that has green grass and is completely healthy, thanks to the fleece. You've got the flesh-eating sheep and all that jazz. In the movie, they get to the island that is an abandoned amusement park. They go down this roller coaster for a few seconds until they get stopped by rocks, which marks the entrance to Polyphemus' lair. Fast forward, they have the fleece, and locked Polyphemus into he lair with a boulder. They meet Luke and his men, including Selena Beauregard (I might not have spelt that right) who practically saves the day in the fifth book, and they shoot Tyson who falls into a chasm. Finally, they're tied up and Luke uses the fleece to revive Cronos. He succeeds and Cronos swallows Luke and Grover. Percy's blade saves the day and they put Cronos back in the coffin. Grover is back and Luke is thrown into Polyphemus' cave where we assume he's eaten.Annabeth is stabbed and she dies. Then is revived by the fleece. Tyson is back and they head back where the camp is waiting.The rest makes sense, they go back to normal life, but alas, Thalia has been healed and is back.I hope to god they don't make another movie. There isn't a way for them to make another one and still have the same outcome that they have in the book unless they do some crazy thing that barely passes for OK. I don't know what Rick Riordan was thinking when he helped - if he helped - with the making of this movie. DO NOT SEE IT IF YOU HAVE READ THE BOOK. It's a waste of money and time.",negative
Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters,"I loved this film so much better than the first one. I felt the first movie left a lot of key plot points out, but this movie brought some things in without making the movie seem jumbled. Sea of Monsters starts by telling the story of how Talia, Luke, and Annabeth came to camp half blood. It also brings in the characters Tyson and Clarisse. Granted, the way they brought in Tyson wasn't exactly how they did it in the books, I thought that they did it in the best way possible considering the first film. In the books, Tyson was a classmate of Percy's, but in this one, they brought him in to help Percy's confidence, which he needed, and also brought in the story of the great prophecy. I understand some people were looking for the movies to be an exact replica of the books on film, but I didn't expect that. Ad I don't think anyone should. The majority of the the characters were there, the basic storyline was there, and I thought that they brought the Kronos and Talia story lines in very well to make a cohesive and fun movie. The special effects were great to me, especially the hippocampus (I know there were supposed to be three of them, but the one they did have was impressive enough). I definitely encourage people to not rely too heavily on anyone's opinion (even mine) and go see and enjoy this movie.",positive
The Cloverfield Paradox,"Well, maybe I didn't have very high expectations or my inner cynic has taken a holiday, but unlike the bulk of critics and reviewers here I found this to be a perfectly serviceable piece of pulpy sci-fi/horror entertainment. It's no '2001', granted, but it's a very good looking film with nice visual effects - especially considering the budget - with solid performances by a talented cast, and it doesn't bore you for a second. I'm willing to bet most genre geeks like me (by which I mean people who have a soft spot in their heart for any halfway decent looking sci-fi or horror B-movie), would describe this film as fun.And while admittedly about as scientifically credible as a superhero movie, it's not quite as dumb and far-fetched as many of the most scathing reviewers seem to think it is. What quite a few people apparently didn't get is that 'The Cloverfield Paradox' riffs on the very real hysteria that broke out a couple of years ago when the CERN in Geneva (Switzerland) conducted an experiment to find the Higgs Boson (aka the ""God Particle"" - which incidentally was also the film's original title.) The CERN scientists hoped to find the God Particle by simulating conditions in the Large Hadron Collider - the most powerful particle accelerator on Earth - that were supposedly similar to those in the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang.A lot of people worldwide got scared shîtless by that idea, because they thought such a simulation could have unpredictable and possibly catastrophic consequences, and a couple of scientists even tried to stop the experiment by filing a case to the European Human Rights Court. The wildest theories started popping up in the media, like the experiment would cause black holes that would suck up Earth or open doors into other dimensions; heck: even a portal to Hell was considered a possibility, allowing demons to roam the Earth. So of course it was only a matter of time until a genre film would exploit the idea of a particle accelerator accidentally causing a rift into other dimensions and parallel realities across the space-time continuum.And let's be fair here for a moment: in the history of stupid ideas for movies - especially genre pictures - this certainly isn't the dumbest concept ever to base a sci-fi/horror film on. Also, by putting a Cloverfield spin on it - which, btw, actually is kind of fitting given it offered the chance to explain how the creature from the first film ""stranded"" on earth - the filmmakers managed to get the film a kind of attention it otherwise certainly wouldn't have had. It was a smart marketing stunt (as was selling the movie to Netflix) and probably crucial to keeping the film cost effective and being able to put as much money as possible into the visual effects (the budget for the whole film was only 25 million, and practically the only P&A costs this film had was the Super Bowl ad).What I also don't get is why people expect ""hard"" science from the kind of pulpy sci-fi/horror movie 'The Cloverfield Paradox' clearly is; there's obviously nobody who knows what would or wouldn't happen if other dimensions and parallel universes existed, let alone how physics would behave if they somehow ""crashed"" into each other. And of course it's all speculation and characters behaving erratically: that's part of what makes those films FUN. And believe it or not, that's exactly what I had. But don't take my word for it, make up your own mind; chances are, if you're into genre picutures (where solid entries with very decent visual effects are few and far between), you'll experience a similar sensation.P.S.

The Cloverfield Paradox,"I swear this was written by a 10 year-old. A few quick examples roughly in order of occurence:1) ""The world is almost out of oil and everyone is going to die if we don't find this theoretical energy."" I guess solar, geothermal, wind, and hydro-electric solutions don't exist in this universe. Plus it's the future, these technologies would almost certainly be much further developed/implemented by then to boot.2) Within 10 minutes some random dude pretty much says, ""If we conduct this experiment we could have monsters rise from the sea in the past!"" Uh...kinda specific there, buddy. Almost like you've seen Cloverfield.3) After the experiment goes awry and all the station's systems shut down, they can't detect Earth...and half if not most of the crew of scientists automatically assume it's because Earth disappeared. Not because, you know, the systems are down.4) After confirming the Earth was gone they didn't think to use the stars to find their location until way, way later. Maybe I just don't know what scientists are.5) When the Russian is thrown on a table and immediately dies, you hear a flatline. He was never connected to any equipment. This is one of the only enjoyable scenes.6) Many drug trip-esque random events that have nothing to do with anything and don't even jive with the ""different realities smashing together"" theory. Example: a guy for some reason gets his arm sucked into a nonsensically morphing wall, the wall takes it off painlessly and spits it out, then the arm comes alive with a mind of its own ala The Addams Family (or Evil Dead 2), writes down ""Check the dead Russian's stomach!"" and in his stomach they find the exact battery they needed to do something.7) Example 2: a tank full of worms loses only all the worms and they suddenly appear inside the Russian, killing him as mentioned from before. This, and many other stupid things, aren't ""random events"" but would take intelligence (or stupidity) and coordination to pull off. Though the woman appearing in the wall was kinda cool.8) Wall Girl, who suddenly appeared from another universe, has to wear another dude's uniform because hers got chopped up in the wall's wiring. Good thing it's fitted perfectly for her size and shape. Future clothes rocks.9) Wall Girl doesn't know Asian Girl because SHE (Wall Girl) is the alternate universe's Shepherd (experiment name) engineer. But later she (Wall Girl) says that Main Girl was never on the ship in her alternate universe because she (Wall Girl) went on the mission in Main Girl's place. Main Girl and Asian Girl have completely different jobs. This one's a thinker but it's a nice fat plot contradiction, even in a movie with alternate universes.10) Favorite line: ""Shepherd smashed a Higgs Boson, overloaded, somehow ended up here."" I bet they just looked up trending science topics on Twitter and injected them randomly in dialogue, because these are just words.11) So why did the metal glue grab the guy and stick him to the wall? And don't say the unexplained magnetism because that was pulling consistently in one direction and to achieve what happened it had to succumb to the magnetism then (after grabbing him) somehow completely resist the intense magnetic field and suck him to the wall like a monster, even though all the other metal did not experience this effect.12) A room filled with water is instantly completely frozen when exposed to space, but a room filled with air exposed to space doesn't see as much as a speck of frost although water's thermal conductivity is way, WAY less than air's. Go science!13) A group has to manually eject a giant spinny thing so the ship doesn't explode. The commander heroically seals himself in with it to eject it easier. A crew mate yells, ""No! We can do this remotely!"" I love it.14) The miscalculated Shepherd experiment makes a bunch of random chaotic things happen including sending their ship to a different universe. How do we get back? Press the button again, make more more random chaotic things happen and of course it'll perfectly transport us back to the spot we came from but change nothing else.15) Main Girl, before transporting back to her original universe/Earth, sends a message with constructional and operational plans for the Shepherd machine (what they're in space experimenting with) to hopefully save that alternate Earth's fuel supply. Though Wall Girl from that alternate universe/Earth is there to begin with because she's on the same mission, in the same space station, with the same device that malfunctioned. I think they forgot.16) And best for last: They never say what ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" is. Do they mean the chance of multiple universes colliding? Because that's not a paradox, it's an effect. This supports my hypothesis that they just picked fun science words to scatter about.",positive
The Brothers Grimsby,"Sorry for the summary, but it references just one of the grotesque and godawful 'comedy' bits in this grotesque and godawful movie. There is a question thread on IMDb asking if others thought The Brothers Grimsby was similar to The Kingsman...yes it is...in that it is a movie. Nothing else in terms of script, direction, acting, humor, action, taste, interest, plot, excitement, sexiness, I could go on, is even remotely similar. Would that it honored all three of Thomas Hobbes description of life in the 17th Century: nasty, brutish, and short. It is indeed the first two, after the first twenty minutes I hoped for the 'short' but it seemed hours long.Sasha can be forgiven. In the narrow, nasty and brutish, movie category he has invented he has no place to go except nastier and brutish-er to bring the fans in. But, I was a fan, and went to see The Brothers Grimsby as a fan, but (spoiler alert) spending more than five seconds in an elephant's uterus as said uterus is utilized by bulls in what seems to be an elephant porn movie was a Grimsby too far. But, Mark Strong? Did he, at one time, aspire to be an elephant gynecologist? Did he commit some sort of movie mortal sin that required absolute degradation of his actor's soul as penance?I'm all for gross humor, gross movies, and comedic anarchy of all sorts, but The Brothers Grimsby is but grim, and I'm embarrassed that I stayed until the end.",negative
The Brothers Grimsby,"Good Lord this is filthy, and I laughed right through it, sometimes crying tears. I can totally see why some people would hate it, many scenes are hard to watch. The ""plot"" cracks along and the jokes are pretty much continuous, and filthy. Mark Strong not only makes a convincing James Bond type secret agent but is as equally committed to embracing the film's sense of humour, following Cohen into new filthy territory. Cohen, as usual, has no internal breaks and doesn't seem to be even trying to figure out where he should stop, he just keeps piling on the filth to levels hitherto undreamed of. The elephant bukake scene nearly broke me.Being drunk will help, but you have to be able to enjoy filthy humour. Did I mention it's filthy?",positive
Captain Phillips,"I went into this movie with no Expectations at all, i didn't know it was nominated for Oscars and it was a coincidence i Saw it really. but boy how it blew my mind! This movie Will keep you on your toes through it all, without being spooky as horromovies or overly dramatic. Now i read some Of the reviews and it angers me that no one mentions how good muse was, cause his acting, along with Tom hanks Of course, was what really made me love this. I later found out he was nominated for an Oscar and i calmed Down again, aha. But seriously watch this movie, it strangely made me cry, because the idea Of it happening in real life, which it did, really frightens me. I'm not from the United States, I'm from denmark, who were also part owners Of the Alabama maersk ship. But i still Got to proud Of the US's accomplishments, and the lenghts they were Willing to go. Sorry for my english btw",negative
Captain Phillips,"That went a lot higher than my expectations. I was thinking an okay movie, but that was more than just okay. Truly impressive powerful thriller.The movie's strength points could be summed up:1. Greengrass's thrillers are really fine, I like his The Bourne Ultimatum with his shaky camera tricks. And here he is doing it again maybe with different techniques. As a thriller, Greengrass managed to make this movie get on your nerves and put so much tension, and that's a success.2. The Somali crew.. Now, that's some serious impressive sh*t. Some Somali dudes you have never seen their faces in a movie before come and make such spectacular performances, that's something you should admire. It made the movie so believable that you'd sometimes forget it's just a movie. Barkhad Abdi has made a huge step in his career with this movie and that was crowned by his nomination for the best actor in a supporting role. He probably won't get it, but he deserved it.3. Tom Hanks is just a really fine actor. He was driving the whole thing with his convincing performance. I still can't believe he got my tearing in that scene, or let's just say crying. Greengrass has taken him to squeeze some fine acting skills.4. Fair screenplay that didn't make you forget that justice should be done, no matter how the conditions the person lives in, but it also pushed the eyes to take a look into the world that would produce such people as pirates.",positive
Point Break,"This is my first review on IMDb. I felt compelled to write this in protest to what I believe is the worst movie I have ever seen. It's so bad that I will be watching out for future films by the Directors, actors and writers to avoid all their future efforts. The original is a bit cheesy but it's enjoyable. This is all cheese. I'm amazed that it was allowed to be put out to the cinema in its form. Nobody but the stunt team can get credit here. Similar stunts can be seen in a more realistic form by a simple You Tube search. Please don't watch this. The lines in this movie are so bad you would laugh if you were not so angry. I can't believe it obtained a rating of 5 on IMDb. 1 at best.",negative
Point Break,"I am a huge fan of the original point break made in 1991 and now I have seen the 2016 reboot and boy this is one of the worst films of the year and one of the worst reboots ever. The premise of the film sees a young up and coming FBI agent looking to infiltrate a gang of extreme athletes who may also be criminals. Luke bracey plays johnny Utah in this film and this is potentially one of the most stoic characters of the year and you will not care about him at all. His character is just so uninteresting that it really kills every scene that he is involved in. Edgar Ramirez plays bowdie in this film and just like bracey he is very stoic and isn't an interesting character like his previous incarnation. He is just your generic bad guy that Doesn't have any of the depth to him that you want him too. Also their chemistry Together just doesn't work and you just really do not buy it at all. The rest of bowdies crew were just as boring as he was and you won't care about there relationships with Utah as the film develops. The only performances I liked were ray winstone and Utah's police captain who I thought were both decent additions but they aren't given enough to do in this film for you to really care. The story is completely non existent, it is less compelling because the characters and their relationships are so dull and unbelievable that you will not care about anybody or anything in the film. The script has absolutely no depth to it and none of the dialogue was gripping in anyway. The style had some really cool extreme sports that are really well filmed but I don't need to watch this film to watch to watch good extreme sports so it needs to do more an the film just doesn't do anything more. Overall this film is definitely not worth a watch and go and watch the original point break because it is so good.",positive
Abominable,"First of all this is the first review I'm doing ever on here...and I just need to put my thoughts down because I went to see this movie for it's critic's score. I'm a sucker for animated movies, and Abominable looked really cute and heartwarming. But little did I know that I was getting no more than that. I went with a 6 year old and she laughed many times, so I guess it works for children. But for adults, if you've ever seen anything else by Dreamworks, this is very lame and bland. There isn't anything original, clever, or interesting. The creature's powers don't make sense and are just convenient, and the plot is as boring as it's execution. I really liked having an almost-all-Chinese characters, but that in itself is not why a movie should be good. Actually the best part for me were the snakes, and thought that maybe the would expand on the other special endangered species, which got me excited for a moment, but just left it at the one (adorable) example.",negative
Abominable,"This is a heart felt movie. I loved it. Ignore the technical criticism. Ignore the reference to political overtones. All criticism seemed superficial...perhaps they were fake. It is obviously a kids movie, but as an adult I left with good feelings. Very few movies or television shows do that for me. Children in the theater cheered at the end.",positive
Noah,"When putting on Noah I had heard a lot of negativity about this movie. I do not know if it is Christians not supporting this adaptation, or if it is atheists thinking it is way to much Christian propaganda. I am a atheist, and I like good stories on the screen. What I liked about this movie was that feeling of adventure the likes of LOTR and Star Wars, a movie adaptation of a biblical story that is up there with other science fiction and adventure films. It didn't make the story about Noah more plausible, but it was a great story, set in timeless environments. I have read the genesis story even though I'm not a Christian, and in my opinion this adaptation is quite accurate and true to the biblical story, with some tweaking here and there. A little gnostic view points here and there, but all in all something fresh made from a old and boring book, made a little bit more interesting. Have an open mind, and don't watch it with an preconceived notion. Watch it like you would with any other story made for the screen.",negative
Noah,"Even though I had read a number of critical articles about Noah, I went anyway on opening day. I thought I'd give it the benefit of the doubt. Even giving it that benefit, it was one of the worst movies I have seen. I was not expecting a completely Biblical account of the Noah story, and knew that additions to the story would have to be added, since the Bible version is quite brief. However, who would have thought that would mean weird talking Rock creatures, which looked like they came from a Transformer movie. And the area where Noah lived was totally barren rock....until he planted the seed Methuzalah gave him, and immediately an entire forest shoots up out of the ground, to supply wood to build the ark. When the ""flood"" came, instead of it starting to rain, huge columns of water were shooting up from the ground. What's with that?I was especially looking forward to the animal scenes, since the Humane Society commended the director for not using any real animals in the filming. Well, that was more than obvious! Computer animation has come a long way over the years, but this movie apparently used one of the earliest versions of CG. It looked totally fake, and all occurred in about a minute. The acting was terrible, including Russell Crowe. And the script was even worse. After a very climactic scene, where he almost killed the twin babies in a state of rage, he explains that ""All I saw was love."" I almost left at that point!If one reads all the reader reviews, I think it will become apparent that most of the viewers agree with my comments. At the end of the movie, our audience spontaneously let out an audible groan. I have never heard such negative comments as people were walking up the aisle.Save your money!",positive
Monsters University,"Disappointment.Let me start by saying ""Monsters Inc."" was one of my favourite movies when I was younger and still stands in my top three Pixar films with ""The Incredibles"" and ""A Bug's Life"" ('COUGH' Seven Samurai 'COUGH'). So I went into this film with high expectations. I don't know why. I should'v known what to expect from a university based prequel.Where ""Monsters Inc."" succeeded was where most Pixar films succeed, it's originality. ""Monsters Inc."" is one of the most original ideas ever conceived, a story centerd around monsters in an alternate monster universe that travel through closet door portals to the human world to scare children to generate energy for their world. It doesn't get much more original then that. And the originality stopped dead there, because the last thing this prequel has is originality.For starters there were barely any new characters... I should rephrase, no new characters worth remembering or caring about. The only main new characters added were complete stereotypical university centred characters, the geeks and the jocks, and in their most generic forms. Oh and don't forget the overly strict administrator who (Surprise, Surprise) shows caring by the end of the film having a change of heart and doesn't seem so mean after all. And of course the stereotypical dumb/naive, easily excitable mother figure.The most promising thing about this movie was seeing the transition for Randal. When he came into the movie (not really a spoiler he's in the trailer and it's in the first ten minutes) he's nice, so I was excited to see his transition to becoming the villain we see him as in ""Monsters Inc."" and let me tell you (possible spoiler ahead, jump to next paragraph if you want absolutely nothing spoiled) it was vastly disappointing. It was literally two scenes: one where he just outwardly tells Mike he wants to be popular so he can't hang with him anymore. And the next is he's in the opposing team in a competition against Mike and Sully and loses and then says ""that's the last time I lose to you, Sullivan"" I was heart-brokenly disappointed at this. To me it actually belittled Randal as a villain in the original because suddenly he just didn't seem that evil anymore now knowing that it all stemmed from him losing once against Sully in University and wanting to be popular. They at least could'v developed it further...more than two scenes at least.The rest of the movie was just countless predictable plot points. It's the age old university centred movie story of rival houses having a competition (Screw it there's going to be spoilers, I'm angry and ready to rant) and of course Mike and Sully start off not being friends and what'ya know it they become friends because, common, I know you know this one... Yeahp, that's right! They discover they have to work together to succeed at things instead of trying to do it on their own and it brings them together...because we haven't seen that in a dozen Disney movies already. AND THAT'S IT! There's literally nothing more than that. The first movie was so groundbreaking and had such amazing scale and then they just took those characters, put them in university, and told a story we'v all heard plenty of times before.It wasn't even that funny. I can remember laughing out loud once: a slug monster is late for class and starts trying to run but he just goes really slow and they pull the whole ""Family Guy"" joke goes on longer than expected and I admittedly laughed quite long and loud. But that's it. The rest I could recognize it was supposed to be funny but it just didn't work for me. I was probably just too disappointed to laugh.The one redeeming thing about this movie (ULTIMATE SPOILER) is at the end they get expelled, which I didn't expect. It shows in a montage that they found their own way to work at Monsters Inc. showing that university isn't necessarily the only option, which I think is a good message to send to the young people of today (considering most are brainwashed the opposite).But that was it. The rest of the movie was just constantly predictable and disappointing. They had such great material to work with and it's like they didn't even try. I felt like I was watching a Disney channel show that was a spin off of one of their well known movies, or like a made for TV movie. It was the equivalent of Shrek's Christmas special...only I expect something like that from Dreamworks after seeing Shrek 2...and 3...and 4. Pixar is the last group of people I would call unimaginative, and yet here I am. They should'v left it at the original if they weren't willing to do something fresh with it. I think Pixar should stick to original films and stay away from sequels/prequels. Yes, they struck gold with Toy Story 3 apparently (I'm the only person who hasn't seen it yet), but that doesn't mean everything else needs a sequel...and yes ""Plains"" counts as a sequel to ""Cars"", I don't care what you say. Actually I wouldn't mind a sequel to ""The Incredibles""...okay, if you're going to make a sequel make sure it's WORTH making and you're not just making a sequel for the sake of making it with no real original exciting story to tell. I expect other movies to make sequels without putting too much thought into if they're worth making, because they know people will see them and they'll make money. But not Pixar, they were the last production company I'd expect to do that. A sequel/prequel should be able to stand on it's own, this prequel barely stands on the shoulders of the original, it wobbles at best.I'm just so...Disappointed.",negative
Monsters University,"With Animation industries overproducing computer-animated films for either sequels or prequels, expectations from critiques and longtime cartoon lovers who grew up with classic Disney movies are pretty high. For this reason, It has been a while since I get to be surrounded by parents who like to bring their kids to let them enjoy bright and comical scenes. After coming to the theater with low excitement, not only does this movie exceed my expectation but it also proves that Pixar is not a sort of company that tries to take audience's wherewithal by making a mediocre prequel based on the reputation of an original one. As usual, Pixar consistently unleashes intriguing, unique, and appealing characters with flexible movements and simplified traits that attract a wide range of audiences. Especially when it comes to presenting different breeds of monsters with extraordinary looks and abilities, followed by an absolute storytelling skill that moves everyone's emotion. As the setting takes place in the old days before Mike and Sullivan get to work together in Monsters, inc., you get to find out how they meet and grow their friendship. The story consists of both internal and external conflicts that college students can unanimously relate to. Pixar does an amazing job on capitalizing as much college-related elements as possible to emphasize the importance of corroborations, personal identity, and working hard to achieve your goal. There are also tons of humors that make you laugh periodically. In a nutshell, this is a sincere and endeavored film that sends us various messages to help us progress in many different ways. I strongly recommend this to all the students out there who are struggling with their school life. It is such an inspirational movie and Pixar still rocks!",positive
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Ahhh where to start. I usually don't write reviews. But yesterday's disappointment in watching this had to be expressed either through punching an anvil, or writing this review. But i need my hands this week so I'm going to write a review.I am a fan of transformers, i loved the cartoon series and the first and second blockbuster hit. I saw quite a substantial amount of plot holes in the third installation and I knew it was going to go downhill from there. I had hopes that the age of extinction would clear some of the plot holes i saw from the dark of the moon, and after seeing the movie trailers I became somewhat excited and felt all warm inside.I brought my two boys with me, bought some overpriced pop-corns and sugar drinks to stimulate my mind so that my brain could focus and absorb the new concept of the story, hoping to satisfy my hunger for unanswered questions that left my joy decimated at the last series.I like Walhberg during action scenes, but not when he starts making lame dialogues. And those lame dialogues deviate from being a bit funny, to just stab me in my thighs, depending on who wrote the script. Lame dialogues pervaded the whole friggen movie! There are countless, pointless, perpetually boring ass things that prevented the story, or just the movie as a whole from being appreciated. The characters were annoying, namely Lucas, Tessa and that friggen Shane who is nothing but a disrespectful little sh*t to Walhberg and exhibited this attitude throughout until third quarter of the movie. I'm a dad alright, and I just wanted to punch him the f**k out! And Walhberg should've done the same, what the hell? Few good actors, but the characters were weak. Every time i thought that the movie was trying to make people laugh, I look around the entire cinema and see people staring at the screen, not laughing. I look at my boys and they're not laughing, and they're the type that laugh at anything that moves. I'm not laughing because my mind is struggling trying to keep that hope alive while at the same time enduring the thought of another ominous outcome, ""when is this going to end?"", ""stop doing stupid things"", ""stop trying to make me laugh"", ""just stop talking"", ""OMG what am I doing here?""I finish the giant popcorn and my big tub of sugar drink after an hour. I thought that if i just go out for a smoke, maybe i'll be able to appreciate the rest of the movie because my mind will be refreshed. I'll take my time, maybe say hi to that nice ticket collector and make small talk. That's 10 minutes to recuperate. It couldn't be that bad.I get back to my seat. Nothing changes... Every new main event that was introduced in the movie was not properly explained in the end. In other words, it just came out of nowhere and went nowhere. This just piled up leaving me with more and more questions. It seems as if plots were inserted in holes and the viewer was left to create his own resolution of it. The story is incongruently incoherent. Why after all this time, can't Bumblebee talk? With all the autonomous robotic, high alien-technologically advanced race systems that are available that they can't rectify his voice box?? I wanted to see more of the dinobots. And why were they in the... never mind, no spoilers.Yes most of the action scenes were great, but come on, don't make it lame by adding something that doesn't belong there, like another horrific comment, phrase or something that isn't funny. It destroys the entertainment. In fact, just don't even talk during the action scenes please!Graphics are awesome. That's the only thing I appreciate. So unfortunately i left disappointed once again. More than disappointed, irritated and frustrated. I asked my boys what they thought, they said ""ummm... awesome?"" as if that definition has lost it's meaning and they weren't entirely sure how to make me feel better. I wanted to research on the writers and directors who created this movie to try and figure out how they defiled a great science fiction theme, but I couldn't give a cross-bun anymore. I'll let it roll this time. I feeling a bit better now.In the end i figure this movie suits those who don't care too much about story lines and great characters and dialogues. Mainly those who like to see giant robots fight. but the movie is rated for matured audiences and robot fights only took place during half the movie. So then I question what are the creators of this film trying to achieve? Use the name for profit and create something primarily for entertainment purposes.

Transformers: Age of Extinction,"This movie has to be the last nail in the coffin for Micheal Bay's Transformers franchise , the over use of lens flare is super annoying in 3d and gets old very fast , the random explosions that go off time and time again get old very fast , the use of particle effects is very cool in this movie and certain points it works very well but ... there is times in the movie where the particles kinda take over the screen and just distract you from the movie.The amount of random chase scenes is insane and in my opinion their not done well at all , the tracking on them is done so bad that you get the feeling that the characters can teleport from one place to another.Im not one to right reviews to movies but in the case the movie made me so angry I had to .",positive
Cars 3,In which movie does the main protagonist chickens out before the final showdown (boss fight or the race in this case) and says to his trainer that you have been training with me so you can go and win it for me.The whole point of the movie is that Mcqueen gets to decide when he should retire and so he trains hard to beat the rookie and just before the final race he turns to his trainer asks her to race in his place.F**kers i went to watch the movie expecting that it will be about a comeback story of Mcqueen and not how he is forced to retire.,negative
Cars 3,"There will be spoilers...Oh boy, where to begin.I'll start with the elephant in the review section: The accusations of ""sexism"" and ""political correctness"". Yes, it's true, there is a female car in the film who happens to be a talented race car. The horror!! Look, I get it. I hate having a blatant agenda shoved down my throat. Ghostbusters, I'm looking at you. This wasn't that. Not even a little bit. If you think it was, well, what can I say. Maybe you should just go home to your bunker and watch Breitbart.The bigger, and I think slightly more understandable, issue is that of the overall message of the film: our heroes getting older, and the end of McQueen's career as a race car. Hey folks, time marches on. People change, even our role models. If your kid can't handle McQueen passing the torch on to a younger, more adequate player, then maybe you should plop your brat in front of the TV with Cars 1 on a loop. News Flash: this is real life! It happens in all sports. Baseball, Football, Basketball, REAL RACING! Whether we like it or not, our heroes at some point become too old to do what they do. Progress happens. We improve. As a baseball fan, I see it every single year. Players we love go away, and new blood comes in. The message in this movie is exactly that. Kids need to learn from a young age that you can't have the same guy up there doing the same thing every day. Heck, if Cars 1 took place in the 1950s and was about the Fabulous Hudson Hornet, people would be complaining about a new car called Lightning McQueen. What an incredibly boring world it would be if Lightning McQueen always won every single race and no other cars came along to improve on the sport. He isn't becoming less of a hero, he's not being emasculated. His accomplishments aren't being diminished in any way. He's helping the next generation to become a hero too! And so what if that new hero is female? By taking this apparently contentious route, Pixar has opened up the Cars franchise to years and years of new material. New heroes will emerge and some will go away. I for one am delighted by this new direction. I was concerned with the let down that was Cars 2 that the third installment would be useless. It wasn't, not even remotely. Cars 3 is fantastic, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. My 3 year old son, who is obsessed with McQueen, loved it too.",positive
Underworld: Blood Wars,"I watch the Underworld movies for pure action, a little bit of story, and seeing a bad chick kicking butt. As far as girl power movies go, the Underworld franchise is one of--if not--my favorite.Underworld: Blood Wars was, of course, more of Selene (Kate Beckinsale) being the bad B in black. She was still on the lam hiding from both Vampires and Lycans. She had to deal with Marius (Edmure Tully err uh Tobias Menzies) this new and improved Lycan leader and Thomas (Tywin Lannister err uh Charles Dance) an old guard Vampire. The movie offered me what I was looking for. I'm not some Vampire or Lycan purist. I don't mind their story being retold in different ways or their core attributes being altered as well. Did they get after it? Were there some ooh and aah moments? Yes and yes. I found myself oohing and aahing a few times (or more correctly saying OH and DAM!). I will say that there was one drawback. The last installment was 2012, five years ago--the one before that was 2009 and the one before that was 2006 and the one before that was 2003. My point being that, whereas Selene does do a narrative recap at the beginning it wasn't nearly enough to totally refresh my memory on who everyone was and why they all hate her. I'd seen all of them but only once and it wasn't like I memorized characters or even the central theme of the four previous episodes. This movie was still able to stand on its own even with the brief synopsis of how she got to the point she was at. It's a solid movie that can be viewed all on its own if one should choose to.",negative
Underworld: Blood Wars,"The Underworld movies are not classics, but if you enjoy hammy acting, vampires, werewolves and Kate Beckinsale in skin tight leather kicking ass then they can be a lot of fun.Blood Wars is an end game of sorts, although it still leaves room for more films if the money men think it worthwhile. It would be a decent ending if they decide to close the chapter on this franchise now.The plot is quite straightforward, there's some decent action and fight scenes and a few new characters and creatures introduced, and it doesn't drag on too long and outstay its welcome. Charles Dance lends some gravitas to the cast, and Lara Pulver has a lot of fun as the power crazed Semira, while Kate Beckinsale is as youthful and badass as ever.If you enjoy the Underworld series then I'm sure you'll find this a decent addition.",positive
The Spy Who Dumped Me,Don't Bother. Can't believe how stupid this movie was. Kate Mckinnon; absolutely dreadful in this picture.,negative
The Spy Who Dumped Me,"Don't expect deep charater studies, layered storylines, plot twists like apparently some of the reviewers do. Frankly I find it absurd to rate a solid, entertaining, popcorn movie with 1 or 2 stars. Maybe you don't like this genre. But rating a Bach concert with one star because you hate classical music or Bach doesn't make any sense. Within its genre I would have rated it with at least 7 or 8 IMDB stars. I gave it 9 to balance out some of the super negative reviews. There are plenty of chuckle moments some good laughs, good and even great action, a simple but effective storyline, good acting, nice build up. Kate McKinnon gets better throughout the movie. I wonder if they actually shot the second part later than the first part, or if the script just suited her better in the second half.
I was entertained throughout. And would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a lighthearted, action/comedy movie.",positive
Into the Woods,"Left the theater I just could not take the pain. Many others left as well Reading the reviews I am stunned at the number of positive reviews. Perhaps one of the worst movies I have ever seen I want those two hours of my life back. What am I missing, wonderful cast but the movie just dragged on and on with most songs boring at best. I did enjoy two princes singing - that was funny, but otherwise terrible movie. Save your money!! Cast was great but unused talent. What were folks thinking. Tried to nap during the movie but woken up by the the notes off key. Movie was confusing and just wandered from song to song without an much of a connection to a story. Again, I cannot get over how many positive reviews are out there as so many left the theaters as did I after about two-thirds of the movie and with no end in sight.",negative
Into the Woods,"Okay, first of all, let me address the 1-star crowd. Yes, it's a musical. How could you not know that it was...this musical's been around for nearly THIRTY YEARS NOW! Ahem. Okay, yes, it has dark elements, including references to pedophilia. THIS WAS IN THE ORIGINAL MUSICAL! In fact, Disney toned it down severely! Horrible score? Tell that to Sondheim - he wrote the pieces (and won awards for them)...sigh. Some people just don't ""get it"".This is the first film adaptation of ""Into the Woods"". Several others had been contemplated, worked out, even started casting for, but this is the only one that was ever completed...NOT because it was ""horrible"" ""awful"", or whatever, but because it was such a daunting task! I thought that this movie was a wonderful work of art that addresses a lot of life issues (after all, Sondheim is also a noted psychologist). Others were upset that it was a musical. Oh, boo-hoo. People are singing their lines. How un-Disney-like.Okay, I will agree with one point: It is NOT your typical Disney fairy tale. Nope. Not at all. Instead, it's more true to the original Brothers Grimm stories...let me repeat that...true to the original Brothers Grimm...if you don't know what I'm speaking of, if you think Snow White was about dancing dwarfs and tweeting birds, then you really need to visit a library.People are screaming up and down that this is most definitely NOT a family film. Um...hello? Do you even know what ""PG"" stands for? It means ""Parental Guidance suggested""...this means that you, as a parent, should decide if it's right for your child to view. In other words, BE A PARENT! Sheesh...Okay, enough of that.""Into the Woods"" is a musical. If you don't like musicals, don't watch it.""Into the Woods"" is a blending of different fairy tales from their original DARK, FOREBODING, DISTURBING perspectives. If you want butterflies and songbirds and happily-ever-after, go watch the earlier Disney greats.""Into the Woods"" is dark. It's creepy. It's disturbing...and it's great. You just need to be in the proper frame of mind. I knew what I was getting into, and I loved it. If you're expecting ""heigh-ho, heigh-ho, it's off to work we go"", you aren't going to like it.This movie isn't for everyone, true enough, but for those of us who ""get it"", it's WONDERFUL!",positive
The Ridiculous 6,"I very rarely take the time to review movies, but I had to put in my two cents' worth on this one. I should start by saying that I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan. I don't dislike him, I generally just don't like his movies. A few exceptions would be 50 First Dates, which I liked, and Click and The Wedding Singer, which weren't bad.But this movie . . . Wow! Did anyone at Netflix read the script before they green-lighted it? I cannot imagine anything worse, even if they had intended to make a bad movie.Apparently Mel Brooks said something about this movie in relationship to Blazing Saddles, saying that Sandler's movie couldn't touch Brooks' classic film. Boy, was he right. You want to see a great comedy Western? Put on Blazing Saddles again.",negative
The Ridiculous 6,"This movie is just stupid fun. It isn't trying to be the great American Western, and it doesn't take itself seriously. The cameos are great, and the acting is superb. Just suspend disbelief, have a glass or two of wine, and enjoy the journey. It is great to see Jorge Garcia in film again, His comedy chops are on point. This movie came recommended from a friend, after watching the first few minutes, I wasn't sure it would hold my attention, I am so glad I stuck with it. I haven't laughed this hard in a long time.P.S. Rob Schneider really deserves a role that could bring him an Oscar, he is an awesome actor.",positive
Godzilla,"So, I should start by saying, I went to this move not expecting a lot. My husband wanted to see it, however, so off we go.. Dear Lord, I think I'm going to find the sappiest chic flick available (even if its torturous for me to sit through) just to get payback for him making me sit through 2 hours of this crap. At least the popcorn was good!!I liked Godzilla himself.. But, I think out of the entire 123 minutes, you see him only 20 minutes, maybe? And most of that is just watching his spiky back in the water as he swims. The rest of this movie is watching the main actor, who, in my opinion, has about as much acting depth as Kristen Stewart, look like a total tool. The shining grace, I thought, was that this movie had Ken Watanabe in it. I like Watanabe but even he looked like he was suffering from a bad case of the Taco Bell revenge and couldn't find a bathroom for the entire movie.I spent the majority of this movie picking out dumb stuff that just amounts to bad writing. Example: Okay, the two bad monsters (which, in my opinion resemble a cross between those white strider things that the muppets ride in ""The Dark Crystal"" with a bit of ""Aliens"" thrown in to make them somewhat scary?) have the ability of creating EMPs, killing all electronics and causing aircraft to fall out of the sky.. We learn this early on in the movie, probably in the first 30 minutes. Think the military learns their lesson?? Nope, lets continuously throw about 600 billion dollars worth of F-35s and Battleships in the mix just so we can have it continuously plummet into the water. Another example: They know these muppet hybrids like to eat Radioactive materials and I guess can smell it. And hey, there's one making its way from Vegas to San Fransisco. So lets strap a huge bomb on a train and slowly move it from Vegas to San Fransisco along the same exact path that the critter is going. What kinda harm could that cause? Its not like the thing would smell it on the train and come after it, right? And why is it, the military storms into a radioactive storage facility but has no clue that an entire half of mountain has just been blasted out by muppet hybrid #2 (who's much bigger than #1) and this 30 story tall critter is somehow making its way towards Vegas completely undetected? And while we're on the subject of the bomb, what the heck is up with the ""breeding"" of the two muppet hybrids anyway?? You got a male, you got a female (complete with some glowy bulging egg sac thing that they give us a really good closeup of.. They meet up to reproduce.. which involves the male giving the female the long, phallic shaped, radioactive bomb which she then rubs between her legs all over this glowy egg sac.. WtF?? How the heck did these things breed before mankind started making huge phallic shaped missiles anyway? Oh..Did I mention the acting was bad?? I don't recall liking ANY of the characters, with exception to the dad (played by Bryan Cranston) and he dies within the first 20 minutes of the movie. There are characters that seem to have no purpose whatsoever besides trying to find a way to fill a 2 hour movie with irrelevant fluff. Lil Asian boy on the elevated train in Hawaii? Didn't see any point to him.. The main characters wife and little boy?? Added nothing to the story to be honest. (And what military wife who knows her husband is in danger isn't waiting by the phone for news? Nope, phones ringing and she's doing whatever.. Or tells her co-worker she's unavailable?) The acting had no depth to it, everyone came off very flat and honestly, unlikable. There's no emotion whatsoever. Hey, a couple of muppet hybrids are destroying our city, oh well. A huge Godzilla is barreling towards our aircraft carrier? Don't panic.. lets stand at the guardrail and watch it peacefully because any emotion such as fear would be too much to ask.Pretty sad when the most exciting thing about this movie is a bird hitting the bus window.. Although, to be honest, the CGI on the actual fight between Godzilla and the muppet hybrids was nice, the whole 5 minutes it lasted. Then, Godzilla jumps in the water and the credits roll. Best part of the whole movie.. Compared to the other 121 minutes of this movie, the credits are the best 2 minutes overall.",negative
Godzilla,"Remember 'Jaws'? Remember the way you only got to see little glimpses of the shark or just the remains of his victims for nearly half the movie? Instead, you got to meet half the town first and all the main characters while fear and paranoia slowly spread across the whole community, and when the great white guy finally did make his entrance - boy, what an impact he had. Now, that was 40 years ago - but would it be possible to make that kind of movie today? To show restraint despite a budget of 160+ million dollars and all the latest state of the art CGI-effects the blockbuster factory has to offer?As it turns out, it's not quite possible; at least not as far as this latest version of 'Godzilla' is concerned - but that's probably not for lack of trying on director Gareth Edwards' part. The young director ('Monsters') has stated many times that 'Jaws' was a huge inspiration for him on this movie, and it is hardly a coincidence that the (human) hero in 'Godzilla' shares the same name with the hero in Spielberg's masterpiece (they're both called Brody).Edwards made it very clear that he wanted to take an ""old school"" approach - and as far as the beautiful, haunting build-up of the first half of the movie is concerned, he actually succeeds. The atmosphere of mystery and dread is tangible; the human element is there, the acting and the dialogues are solid, and the production design is breathtaking (especially the apocalyptic images of an evacuated city in Japan which was left to decay for 15 years, overgrown with plants and with packs of wild dogs running in the streets). The ""muto"" design - when we do get a first glimpse at a creature - is otherworldly and frightening (as good monsters should be), but as the movie progresses into the second half and the creature-action increases, the quality of the pacing, the dialogues and the acting inexplicably decreases. The movie sadly starts to feel flat, and although there is one great creature scene after another, and although those scenes get more and more intense as the storyline steers towards the inevitable showdown, it's hard to stay invested in the human side of the story.After the first act (when there was actually still some real acting required from the actors), there are virtually no interesting moments anymore when the human protagonists interact, let alone lingering scenes where the characters get to talk long enough to one another to even try to build such a thing as chemistry. So when the finale does arrive (which looks absolutely beautiful, by the way), you admire its epic scale, but since there is nobody to care about, it's hard to feel thrilled.Sure, you kind of root for Godzilla, but since you only just met the guy, you don't feel too much attached. Ultimately - despite a great build-up and a fantastic looking finale - 'Godzilla' is a valid effort but only rarely a thrilling one. Unlike in 'Jaws', there are no interesting human characters here who could help create the kind of tension-heavy atmosphere or sense of impending doom the way Chief Brody, Hooper and Quint could 40 years ago.Trying to show restraint alone is not enough to create a sense of wonder the way seventies cinema did - you also need the kind of character-driven scenes where someone says: ""We're gonna need a bigger boat!""Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",positive
The Great Wall,"When I was little, in Romania, I saw about three Chinese films, all made in that imbecile communist period, very very hard to see. This Chinese production (also with some American, Australian and Canadian help) is not even close to what were those idiotic propaganda films. As I said in the review for ""Kong: Skull Island"", ""Kong: Skull Island"" and ""The Great Wall"" they have something in common. And I do not mean only the actress Jing Tian, present in both and Legendary Entertainment, as one of the producing companies for both films. I refer in particular the monsters and the ""very special""(I mean, very good) special effects. They look very well in both movies. I liked Matt Damon more in ""Jason Bourne"" and ""The Martian"" but he's OK here too. The whole film is OK. Tian Jing is distinguished and sweet.",negative
The Great Wall,"I'm Chinese and I don't think to have Matt Damon as the main character is a white-washing or anything racist. Some foreigners are needed to show foreigner's perspective of the magnificent China : the Great Wall, the weapons, the army, etc.While the CGI, costume designers and production staffs are whites, 90%+ of the casts are Chinese. Even the directors are Chinese. The director Zhang Yimou pick Damon by his artistic choice. This is not a Chinese film, nor a Western film, this is definitely a collaboration, which prove that if we human, from East, and West, if we trust each other and to work together, we could achieved great things. If even Chinese are not offended, why white people called this film racist?",positive
Minions,"Words fail both me and my girlfriend in describing this awful piece of digested food. This movie is bad even by kid standards and, frankly, I don't think they could've managed to ruin the Minions any better. Half the dialog in this movie is in Minionese, of which nothing can be understood. The jokes are so bad, all they managed was get a single l.o.l. out of us. Nope, not a laugh, a l.o.l. The ""villainesse"" is boring, overdone and, frankly, unforgettable for how bad she is. Even the Minions are boring (how they accomplished that is beyond me). To say nothing of the way they portrayed the Queen of England and England itself. I'm Romanian and it still made me angry! If you want to watch this, just don't. Spare yourself the time, boredom and probably money and SEE SOMETHING ELSE.",negative
Minions,"I avoided watching Despicable Me for a long time. I just didn't like the look of it. But as it turned out, I loved the film when I was eventually coerced into seeing it by one of my nephews. It was thanks to him that I also liked the second movie. As for the third movie, I don't know why some IMDb users are complaining that this movie is more suitable for 'kids and families'. It seems odd to expect anything more from The Minions when that is the main target audience! I watched this film with my own family and since this was the first time I took my toddler to the cinema, it makes it extra special. I enjoyed the movie, laughed out at several points and liked it even more to see how much my daughter loved it. We all had a good time and there were no complaints at all. This one, like Despicable Me 1 and 2, was great entertainment, lots of villainy and slapstick humour. It is the best kids animation I've seen in a long time. A lot of fun.",positive
San Andreas,"This movie is absolutely terrible.Imagine melting a 4kg ball of Edam, a 12kg slab of cheddar and 47 cases of mozzarella, it still wouldn't be anywhere near as cheesy as this piece of drivel.I was dragged along to see it and for the entire time I sat there wondering if this was some kind of sick joke I wasn't in on.The effects were decent but lets be honest, which movie doesn't have decent effects nowadays? The acting is absolutely horrific, the rock has the acting ability of a disabled fox and I wanted the two English toff kids to die every time they appeared on the screen.The girl in it, although very attractive, has the personality of a sprout.Bah! if anyone offers to watch this movie in your presence please punch them in the face.The ending where the rock says something like ""now we rebuild"" and the American flag unfurls in the wind made me want to spew my popcorn all over the cinema floor.Avoid at all costs.",negative
San Andreas,"Instead of ripping into character depth and story line, the overall point this movie delivered is an hour and 47 min of action packed thrill in 3D. It is not often your able to go to a movie theater, pay for overpriced tickets, popcorn, and dirty theaters and get completely absorbed into a movie and walk out feeling like that was worth my money and time. As for the common denominator for these kind of movies, at least the daughter no longer needs pull ups after the world was destroyed. Keep in mind, the length of this movie also keeps the momentum of action, where as the director did not fill the void by insulting the audiences intelligence.",positive
The Nightingale,"Jennifer Kent's sophomore effort, The Nightingale, is beset with some interesting but ultimately flawed creative choices.
The 1.37:1 ratio aspect choice is puzzling and defeats any effort to capture the truely spectacular wilderness in any cinematic sense. An opportunity lost to really describe what should've been another essential character in the movie. Instead there is very little in the way of establishing any sense of geography or location. The closed off framing creates a claustrophobic vibe that even applies to the exteriors.
The villains are drawn so broadly as to almost descend into caricature with repeated maniacal giggling and shouting that dilutes any real menace. In fact our heroine seems to have no overt concerns as to any potential danger from said villains eg previous rape/assault attempts or threats to revoke her free woman status. So when the attack comes it feels contrived with no foreboding or dread preceding it.
In fact the emphasis on showing the multiple rape scenes just dulls any significant impact the act should rightly impart on the audience.
If anything this feels like an ambitious debut from a talented independent artist with a limited budget and even more limited creative toolbox.
The 136 minute running time isn't justified, in fact what The Nightingale needs most is to be reduced by 30 minutes. It's languid and suffers for it.
Conversely The Babadook still impresses with its tension, taught story-telling, beautifully realised characters and excellent film craft.
Sadly The Nightingale could learn a few lessons from it.",negative
The Nightingale,"A step up in scope for Kent after The Babadook, The Nightingale is a brutal, bloody and honest look into the life of woman and Aboriginal People during a period in Australia's history that many seem to forget, all while telling an amazing story.Based somewhere around the 1830's, Clare is an Irish convict living in Tasmania (Van Diemen's Land as it was known), now able to live a life out of physical chains, though this alleged freedom was made possible by a leftenant with ulterior motives. Her character begins as an innocent woman, but once this man causes tragedy to strike in an ruthless way, her attitude changes. Upset and enraged, she becomes hell bent on chasing the officer responsible. However, he has already left the village, using an Aboriginal tracker to lead his group north towards a promised promotion.Clare also decides to enlist the help of a tracker, only after others in the community find it apparent that no words can stop her from leaving. An unfortunate but necessary and true trope of films of this nature, the tracker, Billy, is of course an Aboriginal person. The two begin to follow the movements of the officer's group. Their journey is long and fraught with as much emotional torture as there is physical.The two at first share a very unstable bond, a partnership of sorts that forms the centrepiece of the film; both how their relationship changes over time but also how Billy and Clare change and become new people. Clare is haunted by nightmares during the trek, a reflection of what has happened to her before she left, the reason for her trip of vengeance, and ultimately what she plans to do herself.The promise of another Schilling at the end of the journey begins to leave Billy's mind as he starts to care about Clare's well being. What started as an extremely hostile mutual agreement morphs as the characters learn more about each other. All this and more demonstrate how two people from different worlds can understand each other as best they can. Their shared hatred towards the English doesn't hurt in this regard, one thing that they have in common as these 'settlers' wreaked havoc in both their lives.Despite the ruthless violence and images that are peppered throughout, with some scenes hard to watch, this is ultimately about grasping onto hope when the way forward seems impassable. To continue pushing forward despite the odds. The final act drives this idea further and ends on a note that at first seems underwhelming, until the meaning behind it becomes apparent. It then takes on much more power.A trained singer, all the traditional Irish songs sung by Aisling Franciosis as Clare were recorded live. Her singing adds more to a role take that takes her through what feels like the extremity of every human emotion possible. With her face featuring in many close ups, she couldn't have been more believable. A perfect choice - Kent's determination to use an Irish actress in this independent Australian film was certainly worth the effort.In his first acting role (though a performer of Aboriginal dance), Baykali Ganambarr won the 'Marcello Mastroianni' Award for Best Young Actor award at Venice, and for good reason. His portrayal of Billy goes hand in hand with Aisling's performance. The chemistry that rises and dips as they journey forward is a testament to Baykali and Aisling's skills. Baykali is seemingly a born actor, though in a Q&A after the film, he was extremely modest and when that exact question was put to him, he didn't know what to say, other that that he hope to act again. This is a man who, if he decides to, could be the next David Gulpilil, who was the first major Aboriginal actor to feature in major Australian films.An incredibly moving film that could be labelled as an epic adventure, Jennifer Kent has created a near flawless film that emotionally hits hard.",positive
In the Heart of the Sea,"Heart of the Sea is a mass-produced still-life painting: technically proficient but as flat as the canvas it's on. Technically, it's fine; the cinematography is interesting, the actors hit their marks, the sound is on point. But other than a few moments of nice humor and mild sea-faring thrills, the film lacks any spark. It's like director Howard and co. weren't that interested in creating an emotional, cerebral or exciting film, but more focused on simply getting the job done. The story of 19th century whaler Owen Chase (played by an oddly-accented Hemsworth), the influence for the literary classic Moby Dick, is a story worth knowing. However, the giant scale and obsession inherent in this tale is never fully conveyed, as Howard opts for computers and green screens, in lieu of the actual sea, to tell his story. So instead of a propulsive thriller or even a thoughtful psychological study, we get a generic and forgettable action/adventure, couched in boring characters. And much like the crew of the Essex itself, we are stranded in a seemingly endless sea of lackluster storytelling It also features some of the worst cinematic framing ever. Instead of just filming Moby Dick itself or just the story of real-life Owen Chase, they opt for a messy mash-up, constantly cutting away from the Essex's voyage to a recounting of the story to Melville; like bad narration taken to the nth degree. Even some marginally compelling moments showing the survival instincts of desperate people can't save this sinking ship. Watch Jaws, All is Lost, or Master and Commander if you want to take a worthwhile trip to the heart of the sea.",negative
In the Heart of the Sea,"This movie definitely makes it on my top 10 list. I originally watched this movie because some of my favorite actors (Chris Hemsworth and Tom Holland, I know I'm a basic white girl) were in the movie. I can now easily say that even though they are great as Spider-Man and Thor, this is my favorite work of both actors. They retold a story of these brave sailors in a new and innovative way. The acting is impeccable and when watching interviews with the actors you can see how much dedication was put into making this movie. Having to starve yourself to do justice to a character isn't easy work. I would 100% recommend to anyone who loves a action/adventure movie!",positive
Okja,"OkjaI differentiate between storyteller/filmmakers and the story itself. It isn't such a clean break as this of course; the narrative contract inveigles. But the distinction is useful here. He has a scope he is interested in which could be described as navigating the pull against a world that presents as capricious evil. In earlier films, he moves between giving us the world and giving us the struggler in a way that confuses and challenges earning the distinction as art.This time he again shows his mastery over the ability to balance environment and character. Julio Medem can do this. Kar-Wai Wong. But he picks sides from the first moments and never deviates. The engineered ambiguity is lost. It becomes a master cinematic storyteller delivering a story with impact but no value. We are always on the side of the human, never of the world.When filmmakers put us in the world instead of the character, he/she can exploit a rich vocabulary of narrative games derived from noir. We stand as collaborators in defining the world that produces the pains we observe. We become guilty. This can be the most powerful of encounters in art, so when I see someone capable of it who ignores the opportunity in the name or moral cleanliness, I get disappointed.Even Tilda is uninteresting.2 Some interesting elements.",negative

The Huntsman: Winter's War,"Budget $115M. Total Gross $48M! Nuff said. A $67M loss. The people have spoken. If a movie breaks even it is probably a 5. If it loses $67M or 58% of the budget then it must be a 1. No one wanted to pay to see this movie. So, anyone who claims that this movie is worth watching is in direct conflict with public opinion.Slow moving. I've never seen a bad Hemsworth movie until tonight. Terrible!No redeeming qualities whatsoever. The director is to blame, not the actors. I want two hours of my life back.Don't waste your time",negative
The Huntsman: Winter's War,"I don't know why people complain about this one. I went in expecting a fantasy romp with beautiful but evil queens ... and that's exactly what I got! In spades! The other thing that stood out is that the actors are all top shelf. For guys like me, seeing *three* of the most gorgeous actresses appear together (Emily Blunt, Charlize Theron, Jessica Chastain) in a movie is a feast for the eyes. And they all can act! The supporting cast is great (bunch of awesome British guys) as well. The dialog is light- hearted and the love story believable. On top of all this, the story is pretty linear and makes sense. (In a fairy tale-way, of course, but what do you expect?) Most surprisingly, I did feel emotionally attached to the characters. Each had clear motivations and I felt for their plight. Lovers get separated then reunited, a mother loses a child and something snaps inside her, an evil queen wants revenge and power.Overall, I can only recommend this movie. You won't get bored for a second and might even get emotional by the end.",positive
Hercules,"I went into this movie with high expectations as I've enjoyed most of The Rock's movies and I am a huge childhood fan of Hercules (the old movies, not the Kevin Sorbo series) and I hoped this would be a return to the glory days of Hercules. Instead we have tired old cornball stereotype a la Steven Spielberg at his most nauseating with the smarmy kid, the athletic girl, the wise old cornball, the loyal dog-boy, and the capable friend. There is a suggestion of Hercules being a fraud and his ""disciples"" around him being the root of his mythic status with the little PT Barnham kid endlessly hocking everything Hercules does. The fights scenes are a couple steps back in technology as I have no idea how you could release this movie in light of the stupefying fight scenes delivered in say the ""300"" movies. The Rock wears what looks like a child's training bra for a chest-plate for nearly the entire movie despite the fact that the chest muscle rests somewhere around his collar bone. Everything about this movie is superficial, adolescent, and about the level of a low budget Saturday morning cartoon... on public television. This is career ending bad. The kind of bad that sticks to you and follows you around. Brett Ratner's feeble direction in this crap-fest succeeded tremendously in ruining everyone's career involved in it. Ishtar should thank God this movie was made as now it can rest peacefully knowing some unfortunate incompetent souls have somehow managed to save it from being the worst movie of all time.",negative
Hercules,"This is my first review ever. I had to start because i want to give good movies justice! This Hercules movie is refreshing and a new take on Hercules. It is a TRUE hybrid take of Hercule's as a man and a ""god""...not just your typical demigod, clash of titans, gods beaming in and out, angels flying down to help... type movies. If your expecting those, you would be disappointed. Instead this takes a look of Hercules as a man (I am trying really hard not to spoil the movie here!). It is promoting good morals, that often times how we are is what we make of ourselves. It is full of action and highly entertaining and the story was decent! So if your into action, sword and board... type movies you will definitely enjoy this one. One of the better action war movies i've seen. Don't get too hung over by what your current thoughts are about Hercules and what you expect of him already. Keep an open mind and watch this movie as a hero action movie and you will enjoy it much more.As a side note... I hate critics saying things like, this Hercules movie is not good and no one has made a good enough Hercules movie thus far...well maybe your damn standards are too high. I feel like this portrayal of Hercules is one of the best one out.Hope you all enjoy it as much as i do.",positive
Ralph Breaks the Internet,"A useless cash-grab actually destroying the legacy from the first filmThe first film was great, I have watched it several times. It's a story about fitting in, finding your place and finding friends. Ralph's work in helping Vanelope getting back into the game she has been locked out of.
This film kills that in ten minutes, as she is no longer content with her life, and want to go to a new game, also, she does. So after working the whole film getting the money to save Sugar Rush, she still goes off and joins another game.
Add to that the useless and quite unnecessary mid-credit scene with an exploding rabbit and this film just dropped to the bottom of what is worth watching. Instead of being original and fun, it's a wasted opportunity and useless cashgrab that not only is a bore to watch, it kills the fun off the first film.Ignore and avoid this film at any cost. Especially if you are a fan of the first one.",negative
Ralph Breaks the Internet,"I loved the ""Wreck-It Ralph""; it was my favorite movie out of all the Disney movies from this decade (yes, even over ""Frozen""), but I didn't think it needed a sequel. But this ruined it! Ralph and Vanellope became shells of their former selves, the fun arcade setting of the previous film was quickly discarded, and any potential a sequel may have had was out the window just to shill memes, other Disney properties, social justice values, and Gal Gadot. And I saw that ending coming a mile away, it was NEVER a question that Vanellope would stay in (ugh!) Slaughter Race and there'd be some ""heartfelt"" message about how Ralph should let her go. Don't even get me started on the princess scene, and how Disney made the annoying, shallow views the likes of Peggy Orstein have towards their characters official!The advertising and memes have been mentioned enough in other reviews, so I am going to focus on Slaughter Race and Shank. First of all, very uncreative names there. All Slaughter Race felt like was Disney's way of saying, ""look, we CAN put a realistic violent edgy game in here"". And Shank, no reason to love her at all; had this been fanfiction on the real Internet instead of a movie on a screen she'd have been criticized for being a Mary Sue. Both Vanellope's and Ralph's, especially the latter's characters suffered greatly just to make her look better. I resent how popular she has already become, and hope I don't run into her at any future visits to Disneyland or in any shows or parades there. Oh yeah, Slaughter Race is going to eventually go the way of Farmville, Five Nights at Freddy's, and Dream Daddy. What then, selfish little girl who I'm supposed to believe is Vanellope?Really, if they truly wanted to do more with the Wreck-It Ralph characters, there's still things they could've done while sticking to the gaming and arcade setting, without ruining Ralph and Vanellope, AND without virtue signaling. But we got this, and now I'm not even so sure I can enjoy the original film, the tie-in book ""One Sweet Race"", or even the princesses' original films/anything else with them anymore! And the box office gross is giving Disney the impression they've done good. If I could wish this movie out of existence, I would in a heartbeat.",positive
Adrift,"I hate it when I see people rating this movie 10/10 because the story was very inspiring. That's not all a movie is about, so I'm quite disappointed at the end ignorance of some.The acting was good, but I feel like the plot was kind of boring. It wasn't intriguing at all. I do agree that the story was very inspiring, but the plot just wasn't and had I known the story before walking into the theatre, I'd have definitely expected an average plot. Directing definitely wasn't bad, but I'm afraid I don't have a lot of good things to say about it. The plot was boring, the directing and the acting was average. Don't expect too much from it.",negative
Adrift,"Well, maybe I lack sophistication, but I thought it was a beautiful story and movie. The way it was interwoven with flashbacks and the present and engineered with dramatic and unforeseen elements really made it quite compelling. It demonstrated the depths of love in a very effective way that stayed with me long after it was over.",positive
Time Trap,"Okay...why does this movie have glowing reviews?The premise sounded great. It started off with some intrigue then it swings wildly into left field. The ""archeologist"" sounds moronic, the students are even worse. Don't even get me started on the cavemen. It's like watching a giant trainwreck. It's so bad that you just can't look away and the entire time you're watching you have a WTF reaction screwed permanently to your face.",negative
Time Trap,"While not going into a lot of unnecessary detail, I, somewhat forcibly, have a lot of free time on my hands and not a lot of options about what to do with it. I know, sounds like fun. It isn't.So I watch a lot of movies. Since great movies are fairly few, I end up watching a lot of trashy movies whether I like it or not. Low budgets, low-quality special-effects, low quality acting and etc. are a daily diet for me. I'm an expert on films where someone said, ""Hey! Let's make a movie in the barn!""TIME TRAP is a real rarity. While not a summer blockbuster or awards night darling, it somehow manages to be both cheap'n'cheesy and a really good, entertaining movie. It's proof that just because you have to make a movie with your allowance money doesn't mean the resulting flick has to be unwatchable.Perforce, the plot is very simple. If you think about it, nature is full of surprisingly large-scale booby-traps. As examples: the La Brea tar pits have trapped countless thousands of animals for literally tens of thousands of years (and even one human girl). Whole valleys located near volcanically active areas have seen entire populations of animals wiped out by escaping poison fumes. Even whole large-scale dinosaur nesting sites, complete with nesting dinosaurs and eggs, have been wiped out en masse by some natural disaster or other. Sinkholes and caves with vertical walls have been treasure troves of ancient animal skeletons trapped over thousands of years.And so on.Similarly, in TIME TRAP, we have a cave system that, for some unexplained reason, has varying levels of time ""bubbles"" within which time is operating on different scales relative to the larger, outside world. Anyone venturing within the cave system becomes ""trapped"" in the sense that while they are inside the cave system they are like bugs trapped in amber, effectively frozen in time while the outside world races ahead in ""normal"" timescale. Technically, people CAN leave, but if they've been within the cave system for any length of time beyond a minute or so, the outside world will have changed beyond recognition when they return to it.Many of the situations that you might imagine given such a plot description properly play out in the movie. Characters standing outside any time bubble (or within a ""faster"" time bubble) view other characters standing in other bubbles as either frozen statues or vanishing in an instant. Moving from one bubble to the next, characters who were looking like statues suddenly start moving. Throwing an object from one bubble to another sees that object suddenly freeze in midair. Standing inside a time bubble and looking out upon the outside world one sees the sun flashing by in streaks, very similar to what one sees in any time machine movie.Fascinatingly, again like bugs caught in amber, over the eons, humans from different eras and different levels of evolution have become ""trapped"" within the system. The characters which represent the protagonists in the movie encounter everything from cavemen to people from the future. There's one particular scene which depicts an ongoing free-for-all brawl occurring within an especially slow-moving time bubble featuring and including people from many different eras. Wonderfully imaginative.There are a few relative-time errors within the movie that the viewer has to turn a blind eye to in the name of poetic license. TIME TRAP is somewhat careful in laying out the speed of the time differential between the outside world and the main bubble that our protagonists are trapped within and then clearly violates those time relationships in order to play out some poignant scenes between some of the characters that know each other. Oh, well. Wink wink nudge nudge, give the makers a break. Considering how well they did with the rest of the picture, made with $1.95, I choose to let this one go. Most movies with these sorts of resource origins have too many screw-ups to count. All things considered, TIME TRAP does a pretty nice job with its premise.I gave this movie a 9/10 which some people might interpret as my claiming that it's on a par with RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK or something, which is not my intent. I simply feel that a low-end movie that rises so far above its station should be well rewarded. TIME TRAP is what it is, and judged relative to the other movies in the bargain bin it comes from, it is a sort of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK of the stand next to the checkout counter.",positive
Exodus: Gods and Kings,"First, I have a question about the title itself, the movie clearly claims to be based out of the bible. So, who are the Gods here, isn't it one God who brought His people out of Egypt which the movie boasts about also? Has the director taken the words of Pharaoh too seriously when he says I am God? Let alone the title,as I walked into the theater late, I only saw Christian Bale saving some kingly dressed Egyptian. And the next thing I see the Egyptian man calls him Moses. Where is this coming from? Sure, Moses lived in the palace raised by the Pharaoh's daughter but when did he save Pharaoh's son in the war? Moses, the author of Exodus himself would have remembered to give himself that credit if he did that, wouldn't he? Well, the director tries to make a point about the 'valiant' Moses, But later you find it is little too much exaggeration of thought to give screen time of around 20 minutes to the whole act of Moses discovering about his nationality, when Bible just conveys that he already knew he is a Hebrew.Absolutely ridiculous thing is to use Ben Kingsley as Nun, who is the father of Joshua for the dramatic effect of letting the cat out of the bag that Moses is a Hebrew. All this successfully blurs the actual details of the character of Moses through the way he was raised. Truth about his nationality and race helped him choose the side and kill the Egyptian in the first instance he saw his people troubled. That is what truth does; it will aid you in judgment. The most disappointing scene in the movie has not yet come until you see a bush burning and a small boy saying that he is the I AM. I was looking forward to this entire dialog between God and Moses but apparently this Moses was sinking in mud hit by stones and he wakes up getting convinced by his wife that it is all in his head. Yeah, as this Moses doesn't go with a staff on to this mountain like the one guarding the sheep, also misses God's instruction to use staff to work wonders to convince his people. I know, now we just wait for him to get back to Egypt and set things in action, meet Aaron and negotiate with Pharaoh regarding the release of his people. But you will be shocked that this Moses is neither the one who stammers with tongue nor with his sword. He secretly ambushes Pharaoh in his palace and threatens him in the name of God.For whatever reasons, Moses here trains an army of handful of Israelite men the basics of archery, for what? to take down the entire Egyptian army? I doubt that! To deal with this adamant Moses, God says I will do my business, you can stop fighting, only to dampen the Moses's mighty spirit to save his own people. I can't believe they showed the plagues to have had fueled from the river full of crazy crocodiles eating 10 men!! Whatever the director thought of the original story of Aaron using his staff on the river to change it into blood, he came up with this idiotic picture in his head. And all the other plagues are the effect of this blood plague! Clearly there was no effort made while narrating this story to convey that Hebrew people are not being affected by the plagues. On top of it, Moses is telling God to fall in line with the story by saying that everyone is getting affected by these bloody plagues can you like stop? Thanks to the disobedient Moses, it helped the director not convey God's repeated messages to Pharaoh, warning him to leave Israelites from his country. Good God! Somehow, Moses cryptically warns Pharaoh that his son might die that night if he wouldn't let his people out of country by night. I couldn't stop wondering if it not for the actual Pharaoh, this Pharaoh would have listened if Moses just spoke the words as absolute God's word.By now, we should know what to expect from this Moses, but I was totally unmoved by his concern for lambs over the preparation for Passover. We see that the movie might end soon when Hebrew people start to leave Egypt with anticipation about the great Red sea scene. Another disappointment greets us there as well, no amount of joy is shown on the faces of people who have been slaves for 400 years once they got freedom, I am sure the director very well knows how America celebrates 4th of July! I think I need to let go of some more failures of Moses here and just come to the end, yeah there is no parting of the red sea! You will be aghast to discover the reason for water to recede, Moses flinging his sword into the water! Moses has absolutely no clue where he is going, no God to talk to him. Pharaoh hasn't lost the lead, follows him soon. Given the confused emotions of Moses about his love for his Pharaoh Brother putting him in turmoil, fighting his own personal battles he waits and waits to be drowned in the flood. Oh no, they didn't kill him and our hero comes out of the sea to the side where Hebrews are waiting. Now, who led who exactly! Sigh!!The onward journey began, and there comes the Mt Sinai, God called Moses to write 10 commandments, the futility of the movie became crystal clear as God serves him tea and asks him to write a commandment if he agrees on the validity of that particular command. In conclusion, it's a story told but the truth left untold!",negative
Exodus: Gods and Kings,"I'm giving this film a 10, not because it's an excellent movie (it's a OK movie). I'm giving it a 10 for the courage of its makers to deviate from the biblical narration, although it could have been an even looser interpretation of the Exodus story, since it never happened in reality anyway.I'm amazed and amused at the same time by the many negative reviews given by angry religious people who are mad at the film makers for not sticking to the ""historical facts"". Are you kidding me? These people read a story that for centuries was orally passed from generation to generation, until it one day, some 2,500 years ago, i.e. many centuries after the supposed events, got written down, and they call it ""historical facts""?!If this story happened the way the Bible tells it, then biblical literalists really are worshiping a sadistic tyrant, who kills innocent people and even children. Is this what they want?Please think: You have 400 years of Hebrew presence in Egypt and about 2,000,000 people (600,000 men + their families + a number of non Hebrews) walking for 40 years in the desert, and despite 200 years of intense search absolutely nothing has ever been found that shows that this biblical tale really took place. Zero, nada, niente! Even many Jews don't believe in it anymore. In the 1970s archaeologists gave up searching for evidence.So, why should a film about the Exodus stick to the ""facts"" when this story is not based on facts?If religious people want historical facts, how about this one: according to the Jewish Encyclopedia, fact is that the Hebrews were polytheists. After the Babylonian exile (around 500 BC), the prophets compelled them to stick with Yahweh (Jehovah), who was just one of their many gods, but had become the main one.And if you think Moses was a man of God, then open your Bible now and read Numbers 31:13-18. That was Moses! And in Deuteronomy 13:6-10 Yahweh himself commands the Israelites to kill their own families, if they turn to other gods. If you believe in the Bible, this is the god you are following!Again, the film is not superb, but not bad either.",positive
Pacific Rim: Uprising,"Of course it will suck. if you see anyone from the Disney so-called Star Wars endless series just avoid the movie. It is simple.

Rampage,Dwayne Johnson is the new Jackie Chan of this generation when he only need to plays himself is enough to draw a ton of people to the theater and support him show how much of a charismatic man he is.With Rampage I can say that he still in his comfort zone which is a fun popcorn movie where The Rock one again starring as a likable macho man doing incredible stuff out of normal human reach like survive a hella lot life and dead situation or fighting along side with giant monster and still come out alive.I maybe biased when it come to some of my favorite actors but if you tired of Dwayne Johnson just skip Rampage for me Skyscraper is next,negative
Rampage,"It's a Rampage movie, I'm not sure what else people are expecting walking into this movie. It's fun, filled with action and very little on working on guy/girl romance which I always thought deviated from the plot anyhow. It's full of action, adventure and very slight amount of problem solving and that's all you need from a movie like this.",positive
The Legend of Tarzan,"How, in this modern day, with such high standards of education and courses on script writing and film making, can a big budget film like this one be so bad? It was only because we watched in it Gold Class, in comfortable seats and with food service, that we didn't walk out.After about fifteen minutes my partner leaned over to me and asked when anything was going to happen (in the movie that is). I couldn't help her.In fact my seat was so comfortable, and the movie so bad, that I fell asleep three times.When my partner told me she thought this was the worst movie ever, and that she was confused, I couldn't help her again - I'd been asleep.I did however witness the butterfly land on Jane's shoulder, then fly off. What a beautiful CGI scene. Totally irrelevant to the plot or story, and I'm still not sure why it was included.Then there was the scene when giant ostriches nearly trample Tarzan and his mate. At last, I thought, something is going to happen. Tarzan's mate asks Tarzan what did the Ostrich say. Tarzan replies something like - ""The Ostrich is telling you it can trample you."" And then, the Ostriches run off. That's the last we see of them. Confused? I was.The writers and director don't know whether Tarzan is Spider Man, Batman or some other action hero - but he certainly isn't Tarzan.The poor old apes get a very bad rap here. They are huge, aggressive monsters with razor sharp teeth.This movie is a showcase of when bad script writing, bad directing and masses of CGI meet.I can only recommend this film to people watching it on late night TV, when they need to be put to sleep.What would Tarzan say about this movie: AwwwwwwOaaaaaaaaWhaaaaaaOn a side note, it is interesting to see that people that rate this movie high, usually have only one review in their list - this one. This usually means that they have some connection to the film.(Edit 2 days later) I rest my case. After posting this review, 6 positive reviews have been posted after mine, all saying this is the greatest movie ever, and 4 of the reviewers have only 1 review to their name - this movie, and the other two reviewers have 2 reviews to their name. With a ratio of 6 biased reviews to 1 honest review, no wonder it is getting so hard to trust the IMDb rating system anymore.",negative
The Legend of Tarzan,"It's simple. If what you want is a live-action version of the Disney cartoon, or a remake of those old ""Me Tarzan, you Jane"" camp fests, this isn't the film for you. If you don't like the character to begin with, this isn't the film for you. The vast majority of critics who thus far have given the movie unfavorable reviews fall into one or both of these two categories. It's disheartening, and it's so obvious they don't really know anything about the character and don't care enough to learn.If, however, you have yearned for the day in cinema when Edgar Rice Burroughs' epic hero is treated with the gravitas and respect he deserves, and if you enjoy epic jungle adventure with a heart, by all means GO SEE THIS MOVIE! It is phenomenally good! Think of it like you would a dish of food. Let's say spiced curry. If you don't like spiced curry, you won't like it no matter how well it is prepared. This movie is for those who enjoy spiced curry. For those who love it, this is the most delicious dish you're ever likely to taste.",positive
Tomb Raider,"Tomb Raider is the latest video game adaptation by Roar Uthaug, a nameless director. Rarely is a video game movie good, in fact, its never good. Its no surprise here. This is your typical action movie with your typical dialogue and typical everything. It's very cliched and flawed. The direction and script are awful. I was never entertained during the movie. There is no attempt to make an interesting character out of Lara. She never learns anything, she never has any arcs nor any development. There is no style in this movie, it's so factory based, its disgusting. There's nothing special about the camerawork, the editing, nothing is even remarkably good. Its just below average. The editing is ok. The color grading is actually pretty gross looking. Its so frustrating that you have a beautiful jungle and it looks disgusting since the color grading is all gray and ugly. There are some nice shots of the beach and of a camera following Lara running. But that's it. Everything else is either boring, average, or, painfully cringe inducing. The dialogue in this film is atrocious. Most of the dialogue is cliched and conventional, and some of them are so cringe. The ending tries to make an ""intriguing"" twist, but it just falls flat completely. It comes out of nowhere and in retrospect, it does not make sense at all. The acting is also really bad. Alicia VIkander does a terrible job, and her shouts in the movie are so laughable. It's sad that this movie actually takes itself seriously. Don't see it. 
3/10",negative
Tomb Raider,"Well I like Angelina Jolie's Tomb Raider but I must say Alicia version is much more realistic and closer to the video game from 2013. I meant this movie looks exactly like the video game, the camera, story line, special effect, the bow, basically everything. The acting from Alicia is also spot on and perfect Tomb Raider and really looking forward to the next chapter. I really enjoy it and watch it again a few times and never felt bored. I don't normally leave review unless I actually feel special about it and don't believe the low score from some of the people. It is actually great fun.",positive
The Green Inferno,"If Eli Roth is known for one thing, it's that he is known for high levels of violence in his films and pushing the envelope. And The Green Inferno is no exception, it's easily the most graphic movie of the year to receive a theatrical release. The movie features some extremely cringe-worthy scenes where the villages show no mercy to the young students. Of course, this is the focal point of the movie, the gore/torture of these somewhat arrogant, twenty somethings. Yes, there is some social commentary in the movie, mostly poking fun at today's society and how everyone wants to 'appear' to be fighting for a cause when in fact, they are doing very little. And yes, he has a point here, but it isn't as thought provoking as he wants it to be, especially once the carnage starts and those ideas fly out the window. Only for those ideas to awkwardly return at the end of the movie.There is not much to say about this movie other than the obvious, it's extremely violent, nothing more nothing less. The Green Inferno is obviously a homage to those 80s cannibalistic horror movies. Which means the body count is high and the foreigners are going to be punished by the natives in some of the most cruel ways imaginable (at least since the SAW series). But I can't help but feel a bit letdown after years of build up with the movie being stuck in release hell.While The Green Inferno isn't on par with other strong horror contenders for best horror movie of 2015, it is easily the nastiest, most violent movie of the year. Thus, if the torture-porn genre is your cup of tea, then look no further, you've found your next fix!",negative
The Green Inferno,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Acting, writing and directing were just horrid. I actually watched this today, came home, signed up for IMDb just to say how awful this movie was. Stupid diarrhea scene for no reason. They just witnessed their friend hacked to pieces and eaten, then a girl explodes her bowels in the corner of their cage. What is their reaction? Total disgust and act like they cant get far enough away from her, really? They acted as if it was the worst thing that had happened on their trip. Then the random masturbation scene? Served no purpose. After everything that was done to the lead actress; beating, raped, almost had her genitals mutilated and she doesn't tell anyone out in the world that these monsters are running around the woods? SO DUMB I CANT FATHOM IT!!! While watching this movie I felt as though I would rather be on the cannibals table then in the movie seat. Don't waste your time or money on this mindless drivel.",positive
Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb,"I don't really know how this film could have been further from the spirit of the franchise. The ending defeated the entire purpose of the two films that came before it. In each of the other films the main driving goal of the plot was to save the tablet so the museum will keep coming to life. In the first film they fight the old night guards and race through Central Park to see that this happens. In the second film they wage an epic battle at the Smithsonian against creatures from the very Netherworld just to see that this happens. In the third and final film they travel all the way to London to see that this happens....and then just give up and decide that it doesn't matter if they come to life or not; they're fine just being lifeless, inanimate museum displays. If that's the case then what was the point of everything they did before? Why not just let the old night guards have the tablet in the first film and be done with it? They not only basically killed off every single character from the franchise, but they did it for no good reason at all. If it was supposedly so important that this Egyptian family be together (which I find hard to care about since we don't even know these characters) why couldn't the parents just come back to New York? They didn't even try. They were just like ""Nope, we're good being dead"" when every film has been about fighting to stay alive. I have no clue what they were thinking here with this plot.To make it even worse they recast the son, Nick, into this new actor who looks nothing like the other boy who probably would be of a somewhat comparable age so it's beyond me why they did it, but the far worse offense than simple recasting was to change the entire personality of the boy. For the previous two films he was a good kid, precocious, close to his dad and loved that the museum came to live. Now he's a lazy, back-talking punk who wants to drop out of school to be an underground DJ having wild parties at his dad's place at 3 in the morning and who seems to care less about the museum or any of its inhabitants. Why rewrite and ruin a character that way for some tromped up father/son angst that feels forced and falls terribly flat?And to top it all off, not only was the plot severely lacking and filled with holes and ludicrousness (like where was security when Lancelot crashed the Hugh Jackman play?) the film wasn't even funny. I was sitting in a packed theater and there was rarely any laughter at all. I loved the first two films but I couldn't have felt more different about this one. The ending where they killed everyone off was just the cherry on top of the disdain I'd already developed for this. In my mind, the franchise stopped at the second film which had a lovely and perfect ending for all the characters. They should have just left well enough alone but they got greedy to make more money where no more story existed.",negative
Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb,"-Secret of the Tomb is the third and final installment of the Night At The Museum series, and this time the tablet's power is running out and the gang must go to the British Natural History Museum to try to find answers and save the gang! -For a film with some flaws that I noticed, it was honestly pretty fun! And that's what really matters in this, because it's for families, not Oscars.-The story is rushed and doesn't make much sense or hold much weight in the film honestly.-The pace is not bad. It doesn't waste time, but it does drag once or twice.-The acting is meh. I feel like Ben Stiller didn't try that hard, along with some of the supporting cast. A few others however, Robin Williams and Lancelot, are great! -The characters are cheesy, but they are not meant to be super deep, serious people. It's a fun film guys.-The effects range from questionable-to-good, but not Oscar worthy.-The music is good, but really a repeat of the first film.-I will say what makes it good and fun is that it feels more like the first film! It is adventurous and sometimes tearjerking, but still fun throughout.-It is rated PG, so yeah.-So although it has some major cheese and doesn't let up on a pointless story, Night At The Museum 3 is still fun and surprisingly heartwarming. I don't know if it is worth running out to see, but it is definitely worth getting in a $5 bin! I would give it a good 7/10.",positive
The 5th Wave,"Wow! That was complete and utter rubbish. Can we please have it listed under genres as Teen Romance / Brain Rot and not under the genre Sci-fi, Action, Adventure as it is listed above. Are teenagers these days all goldfish???, is this not the same plot as Twilight, Divergence etc only replace vampires etc. with Aliens?. I love my apocalyptic movies and after the first 20 minutes I thought it wasn't going so bad... decent special effects, seeing what each ""wave"" was going to do and I was looking forward to seeing ""the others"", but alas that was it for the movie after that it was like opening a teen magazine while jamming a skewer up my nose in to my brain.I must say I did get a few laughs at the many clichés I called before they happened followed by my swift exit to save my brain from rotting by the absurd stupidity of it all. If you are not a girl aged 11 to 15 avoid this movie like you would avoid the plague",negative
The 5th Wave,"The 5th Wave follows the beautiful and wonderful 16-year-old actress Cassie Sullivan and her family. Waves of alien strategic invasion have devastated the world and Earth's population is on the verge of extinction. Humankind is knocked back to the Stone Age.

However, the army buses the kid out of the camp and promises to bus the adults out next.Cassie gets separated from her brother. Her brother is taken by the Army for care and protection. Her father and other survivors in Ohio are killed in a massacre by the army. Cassie scavenges her way through to the base to meet her 5-year-old brother, Sam. Cassie is saved from an enemy sniper by Evan Walker. Cassie falls in love with him and later learns he is an Other in humanoid form. Cassie learns that Colonel Vosch and the Army is actually the Others and the fifth wave they have planned is to use children to eliminate the rest of the earth's survivors by misleading them.She learns the hard way to trust no one and leaves him.

Jupiter Ascending,"The movie feels like it was written by a ten year old girl hooked on drugs. Cardboard characters are so undeveloped that they should have stayed in authors womb for few more months/years. Bad acting and ""I don't care about what is going on"" attitude from the actors brings final nail to this movie coffin. There is nothing substantial in this movie, nothing that can teach us something new about ourselves or the world around us, which is quite odd for the science fiction movie. True the cinematography of the movie is first class, but it only saddens me that it is used on such bad material. In the end don't get fooled by this movie. Its only purpose is to take your money with bright lights and a false promise, but it will leave you with a mouth full of ash, wondering why you wasted your time.",negative
Jupiter Ascending,"Brilliant, absolutely brilliant! For me, this is one of the best movies in history of cinema. If you did not see it already, then go to the cinema and watch it before you read further. I apologize for my not so polished English. It's not my first language, and I'm still learning it.I went to the cinema with almost no information about this movie. All I know was its a sci-fi. I had no clue who plays in it, or who directed it. First surprise came at the ticket booth. The ticket price was around 15% higher then any other movies I have seen*. This must be a real good movie... After twenty minutes I was already bored by the clichés. East European emigrant in USA with huge dreams, became a toilet cleaner, but soon she will be saved by a werewolf and she will be some kind of princess of the ""world"". What an original idea... As some other reviewers pointed out, the movie is full of scenes borrowed from other movies and video games, as far as I see. Scenes, music, sound effects. Everything. Stunning visual effects, but shallow story and almost non existent character development. For the first sight... After an hour I could not believe that I paid for this... This was the first movie I was trying to sleep in.At the end there was a single sentence that stuck in my head: time is the single most precious thing in the universe. Funny, a film seemingly completely waste of time talks about your precious time.With friends we talk about the movie for an hour. The conclusion: it is so pointless that this must be the point.Then, next day it hit me! It hit me so hard, first I had to sit down, then I was walking around in my room for a half hour. This movie is like a huge puzzle. It makes no sense until you find the corner pieces. I think I found one of those pieces. TIME, the single most precious thing in the universe. This movie is about Us, about how we live, about how we waste our precious time. Its about the clichés filling our life.The first thought of her at morning: ""I hate my life!"" Didn't you ever thought that? Her mother and aunt works dutifully, like robots. They are the modern slaves of our days. She is dreaming about a better life, about expensive clothes, while the rich girl can not decide which cloth she should wear when her rich boyfriend will ""ask her"" to merry him. We all know this will not happen, but she believes it. She wants to be a wife of a rich guy. A toilet cleaner emigrant with brand new iPhone? We are working to get money, to buy things we can not afford. Her uncle practically try to sell her body parts – eggs- and take most of the money, just because ""this is capitalism"". Spending money before you have it. Anyone? He spends on what? Big screen TV and video games. Things he can not afford, but he thinks it will change his life. He waste money so he can wast more time. ...these are just the first few minutes!It contains countless references to movies, video games, books, to different parts of popular culture, even religions. In every scene you can find parts of other movies, games, books. Just watch it and find your pieces.We are products, just as depicted in the movie. We are just numbers on some rich and powerful peoples spreadsheet. We are money machines. Do you think most movies are made for us? NO! Most movies are made for profit. Look at the movies of the last decade. They can sell a movie with a shallow story,and stunning visuals. They can sell it with an actor. They can sell it with just a name behind it. Most people praise this movie for the stunning visuals, Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum (their bodies, not their act). Here is a movie with so deep meanings, that almost no one notices. Its not hidden. It pokes our eyes. But we can't see it. There were so many meaningless movies in the last decade, we can't see any difference. We don't even expect movies with any deeper meaning. Most of the movies and video games are just escapes from our life.I feel I need to say a few more words about the end of the movie to make it round. Did you noticed, she was smiling at the end, even while cleaning the toilet? She was not whining about her life any more. She wake up early, made coffee, and she was happier when she got that old brass telescope then when she become the absolute ruler of the Earth. She did change, but not the way you expected. She enjoys the little details of the life. Enjoys her work, even if its toilet cleaning, enjoys the morning coffee with her family, the noisy dinner. For me, it seems like, she understood that time is our single most precious thing in the universe. She enjoys every moment of her life :)As I said, this movie es a brilliant piece of art. It is about our life. You just need to find a corner piece of the puzzle. I showed one piece for you! Wake up Neo! Now go, waste some more of your precious time, watch this movie again, and find your corner pieces, make your puzzle complete :) I will do the same. I have to watch this again...Thank you for your precious time, I hope it worth reading :)PS*: probably the higher ticket price was just a coincidence. But it made more impact. The pain of wasting my time was stronger.",positive
Power Rangers,"This reboot is by far one of the worst I have seen. I grew up in the 90s and my love for power Rangers was dear. If you are an original fan please DO NOT watch. The film was sexualized and at times a little disturbing. This remake is for a whole new generation. If this is what we are producing for the next generation then this is unsettling. The audience In the movie seemed to enjoy this movie but as an original fan I had to walk out half way. The actors performed more on a chessy, no acting skills level. The villain was a tormented individual with no talent. Zordon was completely different, more of an aggressive angry frustrated personality. That alone made me walk out, original Zordon was patient, wise, and kind. I believe we got 15 minutes of fighting if that in this 2 hour movie. Everything that was once positive about the series, was completely missing in the movie. Sad to say, the new Power Rangers movie was a disaster.",negative
Power Rangers,"Anyone that was a child when the Power Rangers was on TV will be early 30's to late early 40's. Writing a review based on your memories stating that this movie destroyed the Power Rangers of old time is just sad.I actually liked it and yes I am one of those kids. The movie is very simple. They are building up the characters, each being a misfit, they are teenagers so YES you will get a lot of the teenager drama that comes along with being a teenager. It is pretty much an Origin Superhero movie, slow at start but ending with a Bang when the heroes discover their full potential.Why would anyone compare this to the Transformers? It is filmed the same way, the special effects are pretty much the same but this is because at the end of the day they have similarities (robots, transforming) and they can only show them one way. Bear in mind that Power Rangers type of series have been around since the 70s and 80s especially in Japan and China. So NO they did not copy Transformers and the first Power Ranger movie was actually done before any of the Transformers movies. Unfortunately any movie that shows big robots and morphings will be compared to the Transformers.The movie does keep true to the original series and I have enjoyed it. I also liked seeing some of the original rangers in the crowd.Does it deserve a 10? Probably not but neither does a 1 nor do other waste of time movies/series deserve a 10. Your kids will enjoy it and so will you.",positive
Jay and Silent Bob Reboot,"I am actually not sure if ""Jay and Silent Bob Reboot"" even got released. I cannot imagine how it could because that would mean that some studio executives somewhere would actually have to endure this ""film"" for two hours.I doubt this review will help anybody because I could not even make it through half of the ""movie"". I watched it up to a ""scene"" where the blond fella who is Jay and Silent Bob go to some fast food restaurant, and the scene was so stupid it defies any kind of logic of how this thing would ever get released even on some obscure cable station. Kevin Smith doesn't speak when he plays this character so he just makes these dumb faces and moves his head around and somehow this is supposed to be really funny. Do even the most diehard fans actually laugh at this? Does Kevin Smith think he has great physical comedy skills or something? I really cannot think of many performances that come off more awkward, it just doesn't work at all. I don't want to ever think about this stupid thing ever again. Can you imagine how many good screenplays were never produced and this ridiculous crap gets made. Truly just painful in every way. It's not even fun to make fun of it because it's just too boring. Maybe Kevin Smith can take this act on stage and stand there and make those stupid faces to all his diehard fans.I don't know what the story is even about or what happens to silent bob and his friend, just do yourself a favor and never look at this one. If your friend suggests watching this, just punch him in the stomach and go to bed.I will not even rate this thing because I cannot seem to find a way to give it less than one star.",negative

How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"First, I'd like to say that I am a HUGE HTTYD fan (I even have a Toothless tattoo and a massive collection of HTTYD merch!), but this film just left me feeling disappointed.The good:
The animation was STUNNING. By far the most gorgeously rendered animated film I have ever seen.The voice acting was stellar. Jay Baruchel killed it again, and the villain was phenomenally done.This film had some of the best humor of the films.The bad:
The story itself was very boring. The movie ended up feeling longer than it was, and it never seemed to find its momentum.-The way the story was told was fragmented and choppy.
They tried to cram too much in, so nothing got the time it needed/deserved. Every storyline felt rushed and empty.The whole movie was centered around the writer/director's need for a gut-punch ending...A fact that robbed the movie of any greatness it could have had. The vision was lost and the focus was off. Instead of a magnificent film (like the first two), it played out more like someone's bad fanfiction.The relationships that were built in the first two films and the shows were all but ignored in this movie. Most especially the relationships between Toothless/Hiccup, as well as Hiccup/Astrid. I felt like what we saw in this film only served to ruin what the past films had created. Examples: Toothless basically abandons Hiccup without saying goodbye at one point in the film and ONLY comes back to Hiccup through necessity (to save Hiccup and Astrid when they enter the Hidden World). Toothless ultimately abandons Hiccup for a dragon he doesn't know - which is not at all in line with the Toothless from the first two films OR the TV series. Astrid refuses Hiccup's hand in marriage several times, and it actually feels like she doesn't care for him.The score for this movie was the weakest of the trilogy. The only shining moments were call-backs to the original soundtrack.The villain is wasted. Even in scenes that you know are supposed to be suspenseful, you're left feeling bored.The ending didn't feel right. As someone who LOVES these movies - probably more than anyone - the fact that I didn't cry when the dragons left was a huge deal. I felt nothing.In the end, you leave the theatre feeling punished rather than rewarded.Ultimately, this film weakened the trilogy as a whole. It even managed to cool my nearly decade-long rabid love for the franchise. And though I will always consider the first film to be my all-time favorite movie, The Hidden World will remain one of my greatest film disappointments.",negative
How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"I promise not to spoil the film below.
This film is both emotionally and visually beautiful. The film took a good five years to produce and you can see every second of it was put to good use. The plot is outstanding, and works perfectly as a third chapter for this trilogy. The character has completed some of the most outstanding growths in what I'd consider to be films as a whole. Getting to watch these characters grow from children to adults has been one of the most realistic experiences I've ever seen put to film. This movie is amazing, now go watch it!",positive
Everest,The hype surrounding this movie made we want to go see a fantastic action drama with awesome camera work.I didn't get any of it.Characters were shallow and the chance to show us a 3D spectacle were hopelessley missed.I felt I didn't care about the rich people wanting to do something real and felt as if there wasn't enough in the story about the local people or way of life.Not so much a disaster movie as a disaster.So much potential wasted .,negative
Everest,"A movie that's as stunning and as majestic and as spellbinding as mount Everest itself. Even for many of us who've never been to Nepal, just the fact that Everest is the world's highest mountain requires us to respect it from afar. And I think that's what this film by director Baltasar Kormakur has accomplished, it respects the story, it respects the nature and it respects the memories of the lives lost during that tragic 1996 expedition.Baltasar is an Icelandic filmmaker who knows how to shoot a film in such an environment where the weather can be unpredictable and it can go against you at anytime. He didn't want all of this movie to be shot entirely in a studio, this is not entirely visual effects work, they actually went to Nepal and some of the other locations include Val Senales, Italy. It's out there in the elements, outdoors locations that force even the actors themselves to leave their trailer comfort zone behind. And that is evident on screen, it really shows, because every single frame successfully makes us the audience feel like we're there, we feel the danger, as if we're there climbing the mountain, feeling the pain that comes with excruciating cold because human bodies aren't design to survive such temperature. I think the timing of the arrival of this movie could not have been more perfect. If EVEREST was made a decade or fifteen years ago, for example, when filmmaking technology and the cameras weren't as advanced, I'm not sure if it could've given us a movie-watching experience of this quality. This is not a heist thriller ala 1993's ""Cliffhanger,"" this is an epic survival drama.Many of us are familiar with Jon Krakauer's book, ""Into Thin Air"" since he himself was one of the climbers, but this movie is not an adaptation, because it's also loosely inspired by other accounts, other books about that same expedition, so in a way, what the scribes William Nicholson and also Simon Beauty and filmmaker Baltasar gave us is a reimagining but one that captures the essence and I think that's what the actors themselves aimed to do. Josh Brolin, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Jason Clarke, all of them play these real characters that have families, some may have personal issues, and so the backstory or who's waiting for them on the other side of the world serve as an emotional anchor and a driving force. But you only get a glimpse of it, the script doesn't spend too much time in every last one of them, there are too many grounds to cover, so it provides just enough and then brings the attention back to this whole man vs. nature, this ordeal at hand, all over again, just like one of the characters says in the movie, ""The last word belongs to the mountain."" EVEREST movie does make me wonder why anyone would want to climb mount everest, but it's basically the same as asking ourselves why we do certain things, why we choose to attempt to conquer certain goals, whatever they may be, whether it's the need to inspire and be inspired, whether it's trying to escape our problems, whether it's the love of the climb, EVEREST goes to show that that desire could be both prideful and humbling.",positive
Inferno,"kind of SPOILER... It doesn't matter casting, direction, location, production, acting and anything if the best part of the book, the GLORIOUS AND GREAT FINALE that made Dan Brown a genius was changed to the most common, stupid ending of a silly Hollywood mystery/thriller movie. It's like if in 'The Empire strikes back', Darth Vader answered: ""yes, I killed your father..."" or in 'Seven', Kevin Spacey is caught by Brad Pitt just in time to save his wife. What the hell were the producers thinking? They had the chance to make one of the best movies in 2016 and just wasted it. Too much shame on Ron Howard for being such a poor director and for Dan Brown for allowing it.",negative
Inferno,"I enjoyed the Inferno film for the most part as I'm very fond of Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. One of the main reasons that I like these books so much is because they provide such a wealth of background historical information so they're a prefect blend of education and entertainment.While it was obviously impractical to include an involved literary discussion of Dante's Inferno in the film, it's a shame that it was barely touched on at all as to me, it was one of the most interesting aspects of the entire story. Like many, I was also surprised and disappointed by the changed ending. The book's solution was challenging but elegant; the filmclunky and predictable. Pity.",positive

Kong: Skull Island,"I grew up watching classic monster movies at my Great Grandma's place - Wolfman, Creature from the Black Lagoon, The Blob, etc. This movie made me feel the enjoyment of discovering those movies again.I liked the fact that the movie was chronological, and made it very obvious when it changed time or place. I hate flashbacks, and am happy to be able to say that this movie did not make use of them. Thankfully, it also did not make use of the ""shaky camera footage"" that a lot of movies are using these days.Some big monster movies also tend to be kind of slow at the beginning, and hide the ""main character"" until towards the end of the movie. Not so with this - Kong makes his appearance right at the beginning. The movie also doesn't really bog down anywhere. On the other hand, there are plenty of movies that scream ""eye candy"" - where it seems quite obvious that there is not much of a plot, so they are just throwing things around to distract you. While the focus of this movie is definitely on the giant monster battles, it is done very well.Both my wife and I give this film an A+ - it's a nicely done foundation for the upcoming Kong vs Godzilla film.",positive
Pacific Rim,"I went into the theater expecting to see a cartoon for adults and that is exactly what I paid for.Guillermo Del Toro is an extremely talented director, producer and above all an extraordinary artist. Pan's Labyrinth gave justice to his talents and ""The Strain trilogy"" exemplifies his talents as a creator and innovator of interesting mind-grabbing stories/plots.However, Pacific Rim was a horrible movie not only because it lacked substance (a clear plot, climax, resolution), but because it proved to audiences everywhere that Hollywood no longer requires decent actors and plot-lines to create a blockbuster movie.The only intricacies and attention to detail that could be found in this movie was in the CG design of the so called Jaegers (Robots). Yet, the movie served to ignore the basic human sense of sight when most of the movie took place in a dark setting. It was a metaphor of how the movie itself was a black hole of cash and talent with all the darkness sucking and robbing people of their investments and experiences.An episode of Beast Wars that I watched as a young child had more substance and gave more satisfaction to its audience than this movie. Pacific Rim is a destruction to the art of cinematography in that its business model lies in providing the awe-factor, shocking the audience into believing the movie is great with bling. Expensive jewelry doesn't make a woman more beautiful, it just proves that she has the money to afford it, and that is exactly what Pacific Rim accomplished.The movie is just a failure of epic proportions and the fact that it rates a 7.9 on IMDb just proves that we, the collective audience, have just stopped caring. Movies no longer provide us with mind-blowing catharsis, they are now just a means of blowing off steam.",negative
Pacific Rim,"For the first time in many, many years with this movie I was taken away from the problems in my life and went to a place where those things didn't register anymore. It was almost magical. I had to keep reminding myself about the bad things in real life, but then a new robot vs monster battle happened and all the sudden that didn't matter any more. Total escapism done with excellent design attention and detail. Thank you GDT. You have to be an artist and a science fiction geek to appreciate this. I came out of the movie and realized all my problems were still there but I was also hearing the theme music in my head. Got the DVD now and I escape that way.

Pokémon Detective Pikachu,"Here is a list of positives and negatives for this film:CONS:
Massive, glaring plot holes.
Unrelateable and emotionless actors.
Total genre confusion.
Plot almost completely detached from the world of Pokémon.
Constant exposition.
Mostly terrifying looking Pokémon.
Total target audience confusion.
Unresolved plot points.
Lifeless dialogue.
Flat jokes across the board.
Very little detecting for a movie with 'detective' in the title.
(And much more if I were to nitpick.)PROS
Some of the Pokémon are cute.
???I sense the majority of these high reviews are symptoms of ""I see Pokémon, I vote 10"", because even when ignoring the late 2000s looking CGI for most of the Pokémon, 'Pokémon: Detective Pikachu' is a severely flawed film with a total lack of plot, interesting characters or real conflict.",negative
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,"We saw this movie at one of the AMC early preview shows on May 2nd, and I'm so glad we did.
Why? Because ""video game movies"" are something that historically were a ""wait til it's on TV"" type of thing - no real reason to see them on the big screen; they weren't much different than the games they came from.
Detective Pikachu, on the other hand, is an actual movie. Yes, it's set in a world where Pokémon actually exist, and this one can talk to both humans and Pokémon (Doctor Doolittle, anyone?), but unlike a ""video game movie"", the plot isn't just a vehicle for the setting. It's an actual mystery/adventure, with characters you come to care about, both human and not. Twists and surprises and feels. All the parts of a great flick.
One thing that surprised me was how I was amazed by the emotions expressed by the Pikachu character - not only did he feel ""real"" in the movie, his face, ears, body language conveyed emotion clearly and strongly. It's hard to explain, it was kind of like a cross between looking at a child and a puppy... I don't know how they did it, but when Pikachu was saddened, you *felt* it; when happy, you knew it...
Finally, I also do have to say that all of us were concerned about the ""Deadpool factor"" - which turned out to be a non-issue. Ryan Reynolds is a great actor, and like any great actor, you only see and hear the character he's playing - not his past ones.
Excellent movie for all ages, even if you're not a Pokémon fan, you'll enjoy it.",positive
Now You See Me 2,"This film is undeniably visually dazzling, arguably to the point of being exhausting. But what I'm taking from this dubious new genre, if you could call it that, is that filmmakers shamelessly exploit and yet devalue the nature of real-life illusionism (i.e. ""magic""), in which the magician actually has to make something work that looks impossible or highly unlikely (it's a trick), by making use of the nearly endless possibilities of film, in which things that would be impossible in real life can actually be accomplished on screen. So we get things like Lizzy Caplan apparently vanishing into thin air in Atlas's apartment, and since magicians, of course, don't divulge how they accomplish their tricks, the film takes advantage of this by doing things that in all likelihood really are impossible — no explanations or credibility necessary. Since we all know that you can do all these things in the movies anyway, what's the point of making them into magicians, when you can watch a Harry Potter movie and you don't really have to wonder how people in paintings can move?",negative
Now You See Me 2,"Burdened with exposition and backstory, NYSM2 really doesn't understand its characters. 1's Radical free agents are now second rung govt. flunkies with no free will of their own, waiting by the phone to take orders. Like Bond in Skyfall.It's pure treason. 1's heroes who wanted to disappear, who hack, and steal with robinhood charm become 2's lackeys, chasing down ""evil"" people who want to disappear, to hack, steal, like Bond movies, have more charm than the heroes.If you watch 2 in isolation without seeing 1, you might watch an entertaining film of magic tricks, even if it is kind of Ice Age minus Scrat.If you've seen 1, and rewatching it doesn't work for you, try 2, but keep the remote handy. You might need to fast forward.The 5 stars are for cgi-enhanced magic tricks, even when story pointless, and it was fun to watch even if incredibly painful at times.",positive
Riddick,"I've been unimpressed by the Riddick franchise, I think Pitch Black (2000) was both where it started and it peaked.This final entry was rather a surprise, who'd have thought that they'd have made another movie considering how badly Chronicles of Riddick (2004) bombed? Partially funded by Diesel himself it's hard to argue his commitment to the project.So almost a decade after the last full entry (Not including the animations) we pick up where we left off. Riddick is Grand Marshall of the Necromongers but things quickly go south after they turn on him and leave him for dead.The plot is actually sound as is the general creation of the movie. I found myself impressed which I certainly didn't expect. The movie is more akin with Pitch Black than Chronicles of Riddick, they clearly went back to the drawing board and the movie is considerably better for it.On a budget out about quarter of the previous movie it's shocking just how much better it all looks, in fact every aspect is superior. Also starring the excellent Katee Sackhoff I was gripped more than I had been since the first movie, it was really quite enjoyable.Fairly early on however I was hoping that a certain death wouldn't occur, I knew if it did then the movie would be damaged beyond repair and about halfway through my fear materialised. Had this event not transpired you'd have me just ranting about how much of a wonderful surprise Riddick was and how much I enjoyed it. Instead I'll say it's the second best movie in the franchise, but should have been the best. Poor decision making killed the film and has left it merely passable.Good addition despite the hefty flaw.The Good:Katee SackhoffLooks considerably better than the previous film which had 4 times the budgetWell played out storyThe Bad:""That"" death should not have happenedSets up for a sequel that will never comeThings I Learnt From This Movie:Even in the future on other planets people are stupid enough to smoke",negative
Riddick,"I really don't get some people. Everyone was saying how Chronicles was so much more different than Pitch Black (which personally I don't find a negative thing)and they should have stuck to something more like Pitch Black. Then Riddick comes out and people are saying its like watching Pitch Black again. Make up your minds people !Second, if you're expecting this movie to win an Oscar, please don't watch it. It's a sci fi movie with action, killing, fighting and blood. If you got any problem with any of those I don't know why you paid for a ticket really.The movie itself was very good. I've been waiting a looong time for this movie to come out. I've watched the other two Riddick movies waaayyyy too many times for me to remember. If you're a Riddick fan or feel like watching a kick-ass movie then I would recommend going to see Riddick. You don't really need to have watched the first two movies, but I would recommend seeing them anyway if you haven't.",positive
Sausage Party,"This film is the equivalent to a sixteen year old, fairly privileged middle class boy, who has a baseball cap, curtains and t-shirt with the marijuana leaf on it yet has only ever smoked one spliff and made a huge deal about it. He thinks that smoking weed makes him relevant. So he needs to let everyone know he does it because there's nothing else that will appeal about him. Because he doesn't want to come off as a nerd, he lowers his intelligence and because he is too 'dumb' to actually be funny, he swears every 10 seconds to constitute humour. Possibly still faps over that one single poster of a tanned girl in a bikini that his Uncle bought him on his birthday because he was 'becoming a man, bro.'It was described to my boyfriend as 'offensive'. It wasn't. It's vulgar. It's not even the funny kind.I watched it last night with my boyfriend. Only us and a group of three 'lads' were in the cinema. Understand, we all laughed more during the adverts and trailers than we did the actual movie.Within the first five minutes, I was embarrassed that I subjected my boyfriend and I to this and knew it was going to disappoint me.Immediately, you're met with profanity. Now, once or twice to give the impression that hot dogs swear is fine. Swearing so much to substitute for lack of humour is just pathetic. Amidst the language, nothing funny was said. That's bad writing.There's the joke that hot dogs are having sex with buns when they're put into the buns. That makes sense as a joke. It's a safe bet. This would have been modestly funny had it not been repeated throughout the whole film.Yes, we get it. The sausage is a phallic shape and goes into a bun.It really puts it to you within the first few minutes. A pack of sausages shaming each other about their size and shape. (BECAUSE THEY ARE METAPHORICAL PENISES DON'T YOU KNOW! HAR HAR!) Again though, not funny or clever. Then courting the lady-buns by being vulgar. Sausage calls bun a b***h.It was clear that I'd sat us down for an uninspired and lazy flop.I laughed modestly twice. I laughed out of obligation and embarrassment about 5 times.There were a few clever bits. I am a fan of wordplay, so to see someone riding a bottle of 'Horseradish Sauce' was satisfying. The Frankfurters were played as Nazis who hated 'Juice' and their symbol was 'ff', made to look the Nazi alternative. Offensive, yes, but a little clever. I like offensive humour.There were so many opportunities for actual humour it hurts. Nothing that could have been funny was displayed for more than a second.There was a graphic rape scene.I get that it sounds ridiculous when you hear that it's a douche forcefully sucking the juice out of a carton.You might think I am being silly, but I swear to you, if it had been humans, it would have been pretty horrific.Because it was a cartoon, you were expected to laugh at rape.Ha ha. No. I don't think any of the viewers found that funny, even the 'laddish' blokes at the back didn't crack a humoured grin.There's also this really awkward sex scene at the end where all the food engage. This is to really bring home the hot-dog/penis metaphor.A taco has lesbian sex with a bread roll.My fingers hurt from typing.If you're 12 years old and completely new to sex, drugs and swearwords, you and your dude-bros will love this.If you require a little more maturity and intelligence in your humour, AVOID. Otherwise you'll leave needing to take a shower and needing to withdraw from cinema.",negative
Sausage Party,It's vulgar. Over the top. And completely hilarious. It even has a serious message about religion and why we are here. Anyone that says this movie is not funny does not have a sense of humor. I never write reviews but this movie was just to funny to see people on here claiming it's not. They just broke new ground for a genre with adult animation. Why not? I'm tired of all animation being just kid movies. Easily best comedy of the year. I hope they make a sequel because I think it will be even better knowing they did something outstanding. Every character has its funny moment. I loved nick roll as the douche and Danny mcbrides honey mustard. I'd like to see mcbrides with a bigger part in the next one because he is just too funny. Krumholtz as lavish was awesome. I believe it will be even funnier a second viewing. And the final 20 minutes there is a scene so bizarre and hilarious the fact it's animation is just awesome,positive
Chef,"I heard the hype, noted the IMDb ultra-high rating and expected a cool, indie, cinema moment. That never happened for me. Some have gone on and on about all the mouth watering 'foods.' Actually, aside from a sub-par wannabe gourmet meal served to food critic (Oliver Platt) there were sparse full screen gourmet mouth watering moments. Most of the film dealt with roadie 'sandwiches.' Yes, sandwiches... things slapped between two slices of bread and which you will never find in any gourmet restaurant kitchen.A word about Jon Favreau's acting and writing efforts. First, his lack luster performance was a 'fail.' His script eliminates chef's earlier passions for the craft replacing same with a sad acceptance of the fact this years long 'gig' stamps every and any opportunity to hone his craft with new and original creations. This script creates a virtual Chef's ground hog day where same old same old goes on and on.Early on Chef has an ugly restaurant table confrontation with food critic Platt. Never mind that, as some other astute reviews noted, his gripe was NOT with Platt whose 2-star review was correct. Chef's gripe was with his boss Dustin Hoffman who forbid chef from being creative and ordered chef to serve Platt the same old same old dishes he cooked for Platt like ten years ago. Then there were so many other glaring plot holes. Like the 'free' truck and the never disclosed source of the thousands needed to re-do the truck and furnish it with new cooking equipment.How does any renowned chef go from a major restaurant to a food truck? That leads to the dad/son bonding road trip. Son gets burned while illegally working, cooking, has his first 'beer' and the two have their moments.Most all cameos were unnecessary but did show how many 'friends' Favreau has in the industry.What do chef's live for? To cook! And let their creations touch others. As much as I love BBQ brisket.... no one has mentioned this plot hole. Chef stops at a famed Texas BBQ where the friend/owner provides him with four or so whole 13 hours smoked/cooked briskets which chef then sells off his truck. Has any restaurant chef with an ounce of pride ever out sourced his main entrée i.e. filet mignon to Ruth Chis's steak house? And here was a signature dish that 'another' BBQ chef has spent 13 hours cooking to perfection.Another plot hole no one has mentioned. Chef's Florida truck has a cool painted exterior with huge lettering that says EL JEFE CUBANOS. OK it's a great hit in Miami but why exactly does the truck attract huge crowds outside of Little Havana? Chef declares his son to be a gourmet chef junior...after teaching him to brush butter on the sandwiches and crisp them on a grill. But then again there was little else to do on a sandwich/grill truck.The finale was unreal. Food critic Platte chomps down one sandwich and declares Chef to be at the top of his gourmet chef game at which point he says, paraphrasing.... fantastic sandwich...how about I spend half a million and set you up in a restaurant? Remember, its been like ten years since Platt tasted any gourmet meal cooked by Chef.As a 30 minute road trip bonding movie...fine. As any sort of realistic film about the world or gourmet kitchens and cooking I found it to be a 'fail.'",negative
Chef,"I can't help feeling that this movie is not only about a chef finding himself, but it's also about lead actor/director Jon Favreau trying to get back in touch with the kind of films he used to make -- small ones without guys wearing super-suits or cowboys drawing down on aliens. Here, Favreau's Carl Casper quits his big Iron Restaurant job and rediscovers himself, and his passion for food and family, by running a Chef-sized food truck. Results: excellent.Films like this can be lost if the wrong kid is cast. Emjay Anthony is the right kid. He's great as Percy. I particularly enjoyed the way the film handled Percy's internet-savviness, and how he used it. John Leguizamo is a great fit as Carl's friend and sous-chef. Sofia Vergara as Carl's ex- wife is, as usual, capable and stunning.See Chef, and bear witness as a good filmmaker continues his journey to becoming a great one.",positive
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"The Hunger Games story continues with the third installation, Mockingjay. And it's about as padded and needlessly long as every other two-parter we've had since the studio executives came up with this money-grabbing monstrosity of an idea.Not to say you shouldn't see this one if you've liked the previous Hunger Games films. This continues the story just fine. Jennifer Lawrence still shines as Katniss Everdeen. Her presence and talent hold us through even through scenes you instantly recognize as needless padding and waste of our money. The returning cast is also as talented as they've always been and most of the new characters are also casted without hitches. Julianne Moore is perhaps a bit too... Julianne Moore to play President Coin 100 percent convincingly, but she has certain presence as well, that cannot be denied.What bugs me is the story. The book itself was the weakest of the trilogy, though not by much, and it seems that its faults bleed into the film. Especially because the iron tight pace of the previous installations is thrown straight out of the window and we spent most of our time building up atmosphere. And building. And building. And... You get the point. There's very little bang for your buck here and even when something substantial happens, it simply lacks that edge.Plus, they had the perfect closing scene, and for some reason they decided to keep going for about five minutes. Trust me, you know where they should have ended it when you've seen the movie.This is a good movie. It still looks great, the main actors are brilliant and it has enough depth to impress through its story alone. I just wish they had had the integrity to go with one movie. It very well might have been the best Hunger Games movie of the three. It would have had two movies before it to build up momentum and steam. Instead it lifts up the pedal from the gas and decides to stroll over the finish line. Poor form, extremely poor form.",negative
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"In general, the drama part of the story is the movie. It is off by the action. Again new characters were included. The film is not able to spend permanent staff.
The song ""The Hanging Tree"" was very beautiful. Also the sarcastic bird melody is already perfect. It was a troubled film that could have been nice.",positive
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,"I want 2 hours of my life back! It was tedious, linear, uneventful, predictable, and dialogues often scrambled. This is not the worst film I ever saw, but I've seen lots of films, and this episode is perhaps the 4th worst ever. From top of my head I can name a few more bearable things. Say, IRS. I mentioned drying paint before. Even hangover can be more fun. Or toothache. Walking the streets alone, minding my own business is immensely more fun. To spare myself from future torture, I'll make sure to check the IMDb comments first, sorting them by the ""hated it"" criterion. Why suffer? I just hope my comment will save at least one person from suffering.",negative
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,"The movie is a lot like I anticipated it to be. Special effects, plot and acting is like all its other installments, amazing. Having read the book, there are obviously scenes and parts that were 'left out' just like all the other movies that have been adapted from a novel. Especially the Mockingjay, being the last book of the trilogy, there is no room for denial that there are way too many events or scenes to incorporate in the movie. Despite that, the movie was still a thriller. Being dubbed as a war movie, there were several parts in the movie that left me on the edge of my seat, proving the movie to be action-packed. Kudos to Jennifer Lawrence for her role as Katniss Everdeen, she portrayed her exactly as Collins did in the novel throughout the whole series. The way she displayed her emotions showed no other actress could fill her void as Katniss.Part 2 however was missing a slight 'oomph' that many were expecting. Francis Lawrence wanted the movie to be exactly like the book. Yes he did achieve that, but having done that he left some important bits out. A lot of the characters in the previous movie were sidelined, like Haymitch, Effie and quite importantly, Prim. Prim was killed in the movie and her being the major reason why this story emerged, her death lacked the emotional feel that it had in the book. A possible reason behind this was because Lawrence was too focused on making this a war movie that he left behind the emotional impact on the deaths of Katniss' close family and friends. When Katniss' squad members were killed, all of them lacked the 'feel' of when someone dies, that was mainly because Francis Lawrence didn't really portray Katniss' feelings about them when they died. Yes, the movie should be as close as the book describes the plot, but to make it a better movie than it was, Francis should of shown more scenes of Prim (and of course others like Haymitch and etc) to remind the audience that she still exist and to build that tension and emotional impact we're supposed to get when Prim gets killed. In some parts of the movie when Prim or Haymitch and etc re-occurred, it kinda felt they came out of nowhere and suddenly one of them dies and I guess that sorta flawed the movie a little. On the other hand it is a huge contrast to Part 1, where it was full of emotions and less action packed, which might of been intended.On the whole, Part 2 was an amazing movie, one I'd definitely watch again, enjoyed it very much, made me proud as a hunger games fan. The twisted and depressing ending to what a lot of people thought would be a fairy tail closure is one of the many things that makes Mockingjay part 2 one of the best movies to end a franchise. Hope it smashes the blockbuster records. Part 2 ended the Hunger Games installment on a very high note. Really hoping that there's some sort of sequel or prequel!!!",positive
Smallfoot,"Behind every animation movie there's always a great moral, ""Smallfoot"" film makers completely failed to deliver the message they indended to the kids in a simple, easily understood way. That doesn't mean that kids won't enjoy it, as it offers some good laughs here and there, cute characters along with the animation, colors and effects which were great as well.the songs were the highlight for me and i loved how they played with music genres instead of giving the same pop songs that you usually find in animation movies.
I highly recommend this movie for the families, but i doubt the impact it's going to make with so many animation movies being released recently.",negative
Smallfoot,"I enjoyed this so much that I rewatched it again immediately after. And I really can't think of a single negative point in the movie. Everything was made to near perfection. The story, the voice acts, and of course, the music. This amount of joy has become so rare these days.This animation was a proof to the fact that some rappers are a far better choice than the professional voice actors. I am so desperate to get my hands on the soundtrack! Please don't miss this one. It would be a really big loss.",positive
The Fate of the Furious,"This was painful. Action? Yes, but we're talking Physics that Sharknado would be ashamed of. Failure to understand or accept how reality works, even at a basic level. If you know the basics of cars, computers or physics, this will inflict pain to your brain.No part of this movie made sense, it makes all 7 prequels seem like a real life documentary about cars. By far - Worst of the series. By going so far off the deep end, it made it too improbable for me to enjoy.",negative
The Fate of the Furious,"Fast & Furios movies belong to a genre of a bad movies which are so bad that they are enjoyable. Whole series of movies are shameless entertainment from beginning to the end and there is nothing bad with it. Movie offers you everything you ever waited, reckless driving, pretentious stunts, stupid jokes, machoism and (beautiful women). Every time they try to make everything bigger, than previous. This time they bring nuclear submarine to end scene. There will be two movies at least to come to this series. Remain to be seen what they bring next time to make it even bigger than this. Story is quite gauzy, but hardly any one expect anything else. As an entertainment movie wont betray you, but with it's script is little weaker than previous movie. Jokes are quite lame, but some of them manage to make you laugh. Froth entertainment and nothing else. Light story is quite amusing, but some scenes makes story a little lame. For that we can blame movie director F. Gary Gray. Previous movie director James Wan kept story tight and solid. Let's hope they will bring him back in upcoming movies. Movie holds every aspects you ever waited. Senseless reckless driving and great action. Even this movie aren't so good than previous it still is shameless entertaining. Bringing Kurt Russel to movie is great honor to 1980's action movies. These movies are so bad that they are so great and dulcet to watch. It gives you what ever you were expecting for these movies, speed, action, orgulous stunts to satisfy you to pay a movie ticket price.",positive
Independence Day: Resurgence,"TL;DR: It was actually boring. There was a story here that had potential but it was let down by terrible acting, bad dialog, no story or character development at all and, ultimately, no soul to this one. 3 points for above average special effects, -7 for just an awful movie. Netflix this one.Edition watched: 3D IMAXIn 1996's Independence Day, Bill Pullman's speech hit you emotionally somewhere. Even if that emotion was disgust, you had a reaction. All of Will Smith's one liners made you cringe or laugh. No matter how much you may deny it publicly, Randy Quaid's end put a lump in your throat the first time you saw it. There was soul to that movie, even though it was an ensemble cast, characters were developed, the story progressed and there were heroes you cheered for and aliens you despised.None of that was present in 2016's Independence Day. All the new actors were either bad or terrible. I didn't care if the aliens won or lost. Not only were the new actors bad but some of the dialog they were forced to work with was just terrible. Jessie T. Usher's character has a few key lines that are supposed to hearken back to those emotional one liners from Will Smith in 1996, such as: ""Welcome to Earth!"". Yet Usher delivered those lines in such a deadpan, soulless way that made me wonder if he thought he was supposed to be playing an emotionless android. Then you have my favorite emotionless android actor Brent Spiner, who is someone I know to be a quality actor, yet the dialog and scenes with him were so bad I had to wonder for a second if all his previous work was done by a twin. I could go on, but the acting and dialog were just parts of the problem. There was no character development at all. They simply tried to cram too much into this movie. From the constant pandering to a Mainland Chinese audience (unnecessary scenes that should have been used for any kind of plot or character development) to Vivica A. Fox's minuscule screen time, there was too much shoved into this 120 min movie which ended up making it a big mess that went nowhere. In the end, I formed no attachment to any of the new characters and was detached from old characters that I once cheered for.The most damning thing though is, despite all the explosions and this alien invasion, there was no excitement. I was bored. There was a girl in front of me texting and using FB messenger and I found myself involuntarily lifting my 3D glasses and reading her text chain and messenger thread till I caught myself and put my glasses back on. Her inane chatter about how boring this movie was, her cat, the guy she was sitting next to and so forth were more interesting to me than the movie on the huge IMAX screen was.As a huge fan of alien invasion movies, I walked out feeling like this was such a huge opportunity wasted. If you told me the basic story of this move yesterday, I would've been ecstatic to see a trilogy. Now I hope the 3rd one dies in production and they put the money to a Battle Los Angeles 2.",negative
Independence Day: Resurgence,"every movie must have a useless Chinese actor/actress and loads of Chinese product placement. How lame. Chollywood is so lame. I watched this until the 240-minute mark and I honestly couldn't handle anymore. I love science fiction, but this movie is even worse than the Disney Star Wars crap... such a piece of crap. The tacky Chinese chick... how do they pick them? Just plain popularity so it sells in China or do they do cheap low quality Chinese casting couch? She was such a bad pick for this. I don't even care whether or not she slept with someone because I am a man...I just care that she failed to capture the role she's playing and actually she has no role. I don't recommend anyone watches the film. Who knew China has Independence Day?",positive
Ant-Man and the Wasp,"Even though I enjoyed the first one as a comedy movie itself (and not a hero movie, more like an ""introduction"" movie into becoming some sort of hero), it was ""ok"" for me the fact that they inserted a very generic, uninteresting, forgettable villain in it (by now we always expect this kind of villain in MCU introduction movies).Well, this time they expanded the team into Ant-man + Wasp, which was nice. But that was the only main change (besides the after-credit scene). They still managed to create the same structure of the previous movie, instead of a ""hero movie""...again a comedy movie... instead of a well developed villain, again the same uninteresting and forgettable villain.Personally I think I lost money watching it since it was again more of the same, maybe I have should waited until it was on Netflix or something.",negative
Ant-Man and the Wasp,"Loved everything about this movie. I can't imagine all the negative reviews from people complaining about storyline and acting. This is a Marvel comic turned movie so what great meaningful story can you expect. This is supposed to be sheer entertainment and it checks all the right boxes. Comedy, Action, brilliant Special Effects and really likeable characters. This movie was way better than the first part.",positive
Bumblebee,Honestly thought this movie would be pretty good. The beginning of the movie is awesome but then they make 75% of the movie about the girl I went to see a movie about bumblebee not her. My favorite part was when he picked her up and put her in the dumpster.,negative
Bumblebee,"Bumblebee is the 'unofficial' sixth installment in the Transformers' franchise and it is actually a spin-off. I bought the DVD before coming back home last week, with the idea that it would be a good family movie, and I was far from being wrong. This is not only a great film to watch with the kids, but also the best episode in the saga. 'Bumblebee' takes us back to the year 1987, and it looks and smells like if it was made in the 1980s with a great cast and an awesome soundtrack. I am listening to it while I am writing this review and I am already looking forward to watching 'Bumblebee 2' in theaters in 2022.",positive
Sicario: Day of the Soldado,"I thought this was a thriller about taking on Mexican cartels. What is a Muslim suicide bomber doing on the US/Mexico border? Next a Kansas supermarket is blown up by more suicide bombers. What was that woman with the little kid doing going near the bomber? Run to the other side of the store for goodness sake.In this garbage sequel with a repellent viewpoint that taps into the paranoia of Trump's views on the Mexican/US border. The US government has declared war on the Mexican cartels for transporting Islamist terrorists into the USA from Mexico.Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) is tasked to start a war between the cartels by arranging the kidnapping of the daughter of one of the bosses. Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) joins Graver. The the father of the girl they plan to kidnap killed Alejandro's family.The film starts off with some kind of a story, then somehow it ends up in a muddle with a lot of brutal violence. The plot to kidnap the girl just turns unnecessarily convoluted simply because the writer ran out of a plot, so he has to string something up.You have the side story of a teenage American hispanic boy who joins one of the gangs as a foot soldier to get people across the border. This boy has bionic eyesight as he can spot an undercover agent in the dark from some distance.This is a clumsy, mean spirited, cynically racist film.",negative
Sicario: Day of the Soldado,Struggling to understand the sub 6 scores.This isn't meant to be a popcorn die hard style action flick. Instead it shows the dark and seedy sides in the cartel and Gov't conflict in both sides of the border.Really hope there is a 3rd instalment made,positive
Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,"This film shouldn't have happened. I mean that in both ways - like it should not have been produced and none of the events should have been able to take place. To get Sarah's book, two massive locks had to be picked. Luckily while running away from a high school sports caricature, the main characters randomly managed to find an accomplished lockpick! Oh wait, apparently the ""writer"" in the group can pick a lock with a switchblade on the first try! How convenient -_-The narrative is boring. I felt like I'd seen this before - not because I was familiar with the source material, but because they borrowed every trick from other cliche-driven drivel. The worst part is they had very original material to work with and decided to turn it into something it never was that resembles everything else...for a buck.The lead actress was terrible. I'm not sure if it was her under/overacting fits or her voice but I couldn't help but want her off the screen the whole time. Her friends were pretty bad too. Literally everything was bad.This is all supremely disappointing as a fan of the source material, the horror genre, and someone who enjoyed The Autopsy of Jane Doe and Troll Hunter. The most impressive thing about this film is how they managed to ruin almost every aspect. It was never even creepy and it all felt regurgitated.And the montage of the happy remaining characters at the end might be one of the stupidest things I've ever seen. Ramon and I don't even remember her name were last seen in cells next to a now-deceased police chief or whatever. You know, the one the girl lifted keys off of? And then Ramon stole and crashed his car?So even if the me lookey a loose limb man stopped chasing Ramon, I'm pretty sure both of them would have been arrested and jailed. And then the girl is walking through her high school getting nods of approval for what - writing Sarah's story? Literally no one cared except them and no one believed them at all? Totally inconsistent and awkward, forced sentimentalism.I felt like I should report a theft after handing my money over to watch this trash.",negative
Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,This movie was surprisingly spooky and creepy. Sure there were some simple goofs but overall the story moved at a good pace. My husband and I grew up reading the books and were excited to see how they were going to make all those short stories into an actual movie and we were not dissapointed. I love horror films and I thought this movie was going to be some kiddie spooky movie but my husband said he just might have nightmares from watching it late at night.,positive
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,"A completely unsuitable lead actor ruined this otherwise great story. WHAT on earth were the casting directors thinking about when they chose this guy to be there lead actor. It's not for a moment believable that he pulls off all these brave, daring, tough guy stuff. Neither is the on-screen romance believable between this loser and the lead actress.The lead actress was also unsuitable for the role but perhaps not as bad. No body would look at these two and say ""I want to be like them or look like them or be in their shoes"" let alone wanting to follow them for two hours and twenty minutes. Surely $180 million could have secured proper casting. I am pondering for the first time about how crucial it is too have competent casting.The choice of film title was also disastrous. They should have chosen a shorter name with more impact.",negative
