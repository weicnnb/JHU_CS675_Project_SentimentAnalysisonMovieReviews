The Human Race,"i'm honestly just writing this because of the high score and 2 rave reviews obviously written by people involved with the project. i feel like i was duped into watching it. so here's an honest review: this is a terrible movie. it's poorly written, and badly acted. only exception is the deaf girl. she wasn't bad, given the material she had to work with. it's just lazy filmmaking, seems like. says nothing about the human condition (as purported from the existing reviews), only the sophomoric insight of a film-school reject who saw one too many eli roth movies. seriously, avoid at all costs.",negative
The Human Race,"The first thing you need to know about this film is that it is low- budget, funded by a kickstarter project and it doesn't have a single person in it that is known in the movie world. That being said, this film is a brilliant indie that deserves to be in the spot-light. Smart, creative, well-made and seriously dark and disturbing, The Human Race restores my faith in filmmaking and the movie industry. Although this film is not for the film-goer who can only see films with bloated budgets and celebra-whores, the movie goers that do appreciate a film that takes risks and takes the honest yet disturbing route of displaying characters in ways that you're definitely not use to seeing, you will love and appreciate this film as much as I did. This film takes the classic Battle Royale storyline and pulls it deeper into the horror genre by showing a much darker side of the survival of the fittest as well as creating imagery that borders on comic book fantasy. Setting aside the awesome storyline and the genius way in which the film tells the tale, the director/writer respectfully showcases characters that are disabled yet are the strongest competitors and yet are also the weakest. I am in serious awe of this film and I hope others will enjoy it and see it for what it is as much as I do.Please like me on Facebook!

Beta Test,"After seeing the rating for this on here (currently at 7.0, although I suspect that will change) I thought that this might actually be really good.But uhm, let's just say I think the director have a lot of good friends who are kind with their ratings.It's not completely awful, but it's not that great either.I've always liked Larenz Tate so it's cool to see him in something new, so there is always that, and he hasn't aged a day in 20 years (he's 41 believe it or not).He plays a gamer who's been given a beta version of the latest game bound to conquer global fandom, and the plot is decent enough but it's just such a low-budget film and that shows in every aspect of the movie.First of all the ""game"" that he's playing looks like it's well over 10 years old, and it simply doesn't make any sense why they couldn't just use real footage in the game scenes instead. Then at least Larenz would have a clear reason to be so blown away by the details in the game.And the ""twist"" about the game of course would have made A lot more sense too.Kevon Stover is one of the bad guys, and his attempts at being so stereotypically tough would make even Hulk Hogan cringe. I suppose that could be intentional to get a bit of 90's video-game feel to the character. But yeah, he's a chippendale appearantly which doesn't come as a surprise at all.The first hour is still semi-watchable if you manage to look past the flaws but the last 25 minutes is a bit of a drag to say the least.",negative
Beta Test,"It sounded good, it started OK and then it got awful.I watched it to the end which is the only reason it didn't get a 1 star but it is awful, awful acting, awful script, awful production values just awful.",positive
Go Goa Gone,"Go Goa Gone is truly one of the most hilarious Hindi films since Delhi Belly. It's a zombie comedy, with lots of blood and gore, so it's in no way for the squeamish, and the humor is quite mature, so it's NOT a child-friendly watch, but, hey, it's the subject matter itself which isn't really kid-suitable.Nevertheless, Go Goa Gone sets out to bring a new genre into Indian cinema with great gusto, and it fails to fail. With rib-tickling lines, great comic acting by Kunal Khemu, Vir Das, Anand Tiwari, and even Saif Ali Khan as the quirky, macho Boris (soon to be one of the greatest cult characters of all of Hindi cinema), Go Goa Gone FORCES you to laugh effortlessly.Yes, the plot gets a little dragging at the second half, and Puja Gupta's acting isn't very novel (although she looks great), but mostly, Go Goa Gone just always makes you laugh at one point or the other. I was chuckling at every other moment. The zombies are well-made, for a first in Bollywood, and nothing looks cheap. The action is pretty nice, and the songs are quirky and trippy.I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to have a good laugh-fest. Except the kids, of course...",negative
Go Goa Gone,"It's a rarity for Indian movies to step beyond the conventional(and convenient) love stories and venture into the unknown.'Go Goa Gone' tries that and does a commendable job.You have heard of romcoms,now there is a new genre and it's called 'ZomCom!'.The movie stars Saif Ali Khan,Kunal Khemu,Vir Das and many many zombies.There is good chemistry between the friendly trio of Luv,Hardik and Bunny.There's lot of slapstick humor,plenty of boisterous moments.The trio attend a rave party in Goa where all goes wrong.Thanks to a drug,suddenly zombies are spawning out of the blue and they are hungry for any human they can find.The trio find themselves stranded on an island with zombies all around and no way out.Enter Saif Ali Khan as a Russian mafia Boris.Off late Saif's acting has really transcended to a new level of confidence and this role is an example of that.His character is just so amazing.His dialog delivery with that Russian accent,his intimidating yet adorable looks,his intriguing persona-are all things you will love about him.You get a kick within when he says with that Russian accent- 'I kill dead people'.The rest of the cast has acted pretty good as well and i liked Kunal Khemu's(Hardik) performance.There are plenty of genuinely funny moments.Don't try applying your mind too much or connecting the dots,this one is just meant for fun.Watch it and enjoy!",positive
Lucia,"Had planned to watch this multiple times, but finally was able to do so, along with 5 other audience members this morning in the sole multiplex this one's playing at, in the city of Bengaluru. 2 of them walked out a little after the interval. One of the people I met last night, on coming to know I planned to watch this, said it was too boring and confusing, and had to be re-watched 2-3 times in order to understand. He also mentioned that the entire movie was shot using a mobile phone camera.The reviews have been focusing on 2 aspects, 1 more than the other, which is the crowd funded nature of this endeavor. The other being the fact that this is very similar to various other movies in the mind&*^) genre, including Memento, Inception, Machinist, Donnie Darko et al.I had not seen this director's earlier work. All I had were the above intros. I was also worried that I'd have a problem understanding the movie, considering 2 things - 1, being I don't speak the language, and 2, I had a similar problem with a Malayalam movie last week, which did not have subtitles, but which I understood better, and which also had a significant portion of its narrative in other languages I understood like English, Hindi and Tamil.At various points while watching this one, esp. the spectacularly mind-bending and spell-binding climax, I was totally bowled over, and thought that everything that has been spoken of this magnificent piece of work has been cruelly unfair to the screenplay, and the finished product. Forget the fact that it was crowd-funded, forget the fact that there are @$$4013$ in the audience that walk out/find this boring (let them lap up the drudgery of Bollywood/Sandalwood/Tollywood/Mollywood. Let them dream of those lives. This is Not art-house cinema for the pretentious. This is pure commercial cinema (sample the 5 songs, that Do NOT clutter/interrupt the smooth narrative) with all the bells/whistles in place (the right place, that is). But, it is intelligent commercial cinema, that demands nothing but attention from the viewer. Most movies have made me cynical/jaded from appreciating the assembly- line output, but movies like this, and Shahid-Lunchbox-xxxx re-affirm my faith in making that trek to the multiplex, and doling out hard-earned money to watch masterpieces such as this. I'm absolutely gonna watch it again (it Has subtitles too, btw), purchase the Blu/DVD when that releases, and purchase the music CD of its songs (though I enjoyed the 1st one only). And oh, lest I forget, everything's just about perfect - the score, the casting and the performances (all), the cinematography, locations yada yada yada..... Pawan Kumar's voice has Got to be heard, and I'm all ears for keeps. Do Not Miss it on the big screen.",negative
Lucia,"#Lucia - People who have watched #Inception are saying that Lucia is India's own Inception but I say ' there is only one Lucia in the whole world and it is original '. Inception was about ' a dream within a dream ' but Lucia is about ' lucid dreaming ' so there is no way that these both EPIC movies can be weighed on the same scale because it would seem a stubborn act. #PawanKumar is a man who stands in a league where #ChristopherNolan #StevenSpielberg etc stand, for me. Even if you want to try finding flaws in this movie it is 'Mission Impossible', Pawan Kumar should be an inspiration to the whole industry, he has come out of the box of the age old Indian movie formulas and has done a film that stands unique in the whole world (at least what I know of). You reach out for the characters in the movie and that is something great. He makes the people think, 'what you think is a dream is actually a reality but what you think is reality is actually a dream'. You will be 'Mind Fu..ed'. Pawan Kumar, he with his film and his team need to be nominated to the #OSCARS (am not here to over exaggerate). No wonder it won an award at The London Indian film festival. Cinematography by #SiddharthNuni needs a special mention, shot in a 5d camera, he has made an already classic script into a masterpiece movie on screen. He captures every emotions in its own shade. #PoornaChandraTejaswi the music director is a true find and is a bright prospect to the Kannada industry. He delivers justice through songs and lifts the movie to another level through his BGM which is apt to each and every scene. #NeenasamSatish - now who would have ever thought he had such wide range of emotions hidden in him as an actor? The emotions that he portrays as a normal torch guy or the way he carries the attitude of a film star is mind blowing. #ShrutiHariharan the heroine is convincing and has delivered justice to her role. #AchyuthKumar as the owner of the theater which doesn't see audience or as the manager of a film star is flawless, a true actor. Editing - don't really know him it is but gives you the feel of a Hollywood film with his cut and paste work. It goes razor sharp transporting the movie at a brisk pace so that it doesn't bore you anywhere and yet keeps the suspense going along. Now all said and done about the movie, I am gonna talk as a Kannadiga now - Saw some page today posting watch Lucia at your own risk and I like to rephrase it saying ' miss Lucia at your own risk '. ' The movie is strictly not for fools '. People who hate Kannada movies take this..!.. Finally thanks to the audience who produced this movie. Lucia - an evergreen movie . . . Lucia isn't actually a person if you think it is but it is something else, if you wanna know it watch the movie at a theater . . . The only film where I saw people clap after it ended was #Avatar after that it is only Lucia . . .",positive

Frequencies,"I saw the world premiere at Fantasia and chatted at length with writer/director/editor/producer Darren Paul Fisher afterwards.The Universe he created and that the viewer slowly discovers is complex, coherent, intriguing and raise ethical and philosophical questions including the classic determinism versus free will dilemma. The arguments and points of view are quite interesting, with a caveat that in the end, perhaps who cares? There is a love story in the midst (and a friendship) that builds and begs to reach you emotionally with fine acting and directing. Character development arise seamlessly through three different age period and the pacing and editing are quite remarkably on cue.I don't want to reveal too much about this cerebral science fiction, but there are many clever surprises that awaits the engaged viewer both in the story twists and the underlying concepts explored. Even love has some deep philosophical implications at one point in the context of the film.So there you have it: the best film of Fantasia so far this year and one of the best sci-fi ever, from the spectacular script to the screen.Bravo Mr Fisher and thank you for sharing your thoughts and labour of love in this artistic and philosophical masterpiece.",positive
400 Days,"Let's cut to the chase: Avoid this movie at all costs.I don't know about the 400 days but that was most certainly 90 minutes of our lives we'll never get back.What seems initially like a good premise with unlimited possibilities it is transformed in a lame and boring Carpenter-ish c-class movie that leads nowhere.Sometimes after a slow boring movie you might get a rewarding and interesting ending, so your time spend not to feel wasted.Unfortunately this is not the case here. The ending is as ambiguous as it could possibly be.I call this type of movies ""The 3 minutes more movies"" and includes other crappy ones like ""Another Earth"". What do I mean by that 3 minutes more? I mean movies that the ending would be crystal clear if the movie lasted 3 minutes more (or at least one in this case). What happened really is a mystery only for the audience who feels cheated. The crew of the simulation will know the truth soon enough. The audience never will. It's not an ending to interpret or to start a conversation about it. It's just like they ran out of film a couple of minutes sort before the actual ending.The cast consists of likable actors including Brandon (Superman Returns) Routh but were misused. The production soon feels cheap and the pace is boring. Initially you expect something to happen but soon enough you give up and just wait for the conclusion which in this case...there isn't any.Overall: The writer and director Matt Osterman deserves at least 400 days in prison for this crap or even better his whole life far far away from cameras of any kind.",negative
400 Days,"I'm glad I didn't buy into the numerous negative reviews and purchased this film that seemed to have a very intriguing plot. I must say that I even got much more than I expected. 400 Days convinces with a gloomy and mysterious atmosphere, four distinguished and interesting main characters and a challenging plot that doesn't give you all the answers. The movie actually takes its audience serious and requests multiple viewing and the use of your brain. The number of analyses, questions and theories around the movie on the internet only underlines the film's intellectual touch.Why did the movie get so many negative reviews then? Of course, some people might just not like it. The film doesn't have any stunning special effects like so many other science-fiction films. The film didn't have a big budget and the settings aren't much developed. While the actors and actresses are doing a solid job in my book, there isn't a particularly outstanding performance and you obviously won't find any big names involved here.However, I suspect that most reviewers rated this movie down because they literally didn't understand it. You can identify those people by reading sentences like ''The movie didn't have a proper ending!'', ''How is it possible that the Moon got destroyed?'' and ''The behavior of the characters doesn't make any sense!''. The movie does have a clear ending that makes you think and that makes sense once you really think about it. The explanation that the Moon got destroyed doesn't have anything to do with what's really going on. And the characters react very emotionally because three of them are receiving drugs and because specific planned events are supposed to trigger their exaggerated reactions. I won't give any more information than this and there might be different similar interpretations of the film but it's important to understand the movie by looking at its whole essence and the things that are said in the beginning instead of taking every statement each character makes literally.If you are ready to explore a science-fiction movie with an experimental, intelligent and interpretative plot, you will be surprised by 400 Days. If you are looking for a spectacular science- fiction movie with a big budget and perfectly clear answers, you should better watch another shallow Star Wars or Star Trek sequel or stick to popcorn cinema fur juvenile minds such as Guardians of the Galaxy.",positive
Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods,"OK just to make it clear, the guys who reviewed it and gave it a 9 out of 10, aren't DBZ fans at all.I've loved that manga since early 90's, as a teenager, and loved all OVA (first broly being the best of them all) . I brought in a friend that is a huge fan too, relaxed, closed curtains, watched the movie... and we waited ; we waited for the story to skip the poor jokes and so on. Until I realised it was exactly designed the same way the previous Tarble anime was, poor humour, poor enemy's design, motivation, etc. The realisation is OK, but I really can't believe Akira Toriyama took part into that , and if so, I would be ultimately disappointed. How can people consider that to be a dragon ball movie, when there is only kawai fan service? Bills, is an absolutely empty shell character, the story is for kids. If you're over 10 , you might really be upset about this being called Dragon Ball. Only time we probably enjoyed was the overall 5-10 minutes fighting sequence, and that was really to say that something was still kind of brought back from the old DBZ and updated with today's technical improvements. So to summarize : if you're a real hardcore DBZ fan (meaning you didn't even wasted your time watching GT, as I did) , you'd better skip this movie, even if I know curiosity will prevail, but don't' have huge expectations, this is simply the WORST dragon ball movie I've ever seen. My buddy asked me seriously if that was a dragon ball parody movie or if it was real... Please Toei guys and Toriyama san , if you read that, please never do that again to your real fans. You just dealt a fatal blow to that magic manga that dragon ball is , and I'm not sure I'd go for a next movie if it's so bad. You have been warned guys.",negative
Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods,"Finally for all these days it came true, A new Dragon Ball Z Movie came up.I was so happy to hear the news for the first time, guess what? i was the one who requested and added this page to IMDb just to let the world know about the movie more and share its information as IMDb is the best for it.I love the Akira Toriyama's story in this, the battles so intense, loved watching it :D and the way story lines ended, seems as in Future we could see more of Dragon Ball Z, hoping for a new Series just like before and i am hearing rumors that there will be one? i believe there should be one as now we know there is 7 other Universe in it, wow hoping that there will be few more people like Goku who are just as or more powerful than him, Akira PLEASE WE WANT MORE!!!",positive
Harlock: Space Pirate,"This review is nothing but spoilers. Read it or don't, but please don't watch this horrible movie.

Pursue plan to DESTROY THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE which will kill hundreds of billions of people.03. Kill countless people on dozens of ships while executing the plan to destroy the universe.04.

Harlock: Space Pirate,"It is certainly not a film for children, because of some hidden contents and messages, and also for how some topics have been treated. Yet, Captain Harlock embodies an ideal of freedom that we all seek, since we are babies. For all our attempts to act in full autonomy, we are seen as ""different"" and judged, often condemned. This animated rendering film is a potential Digital Masterpiece, compelling and convincing. The job done by the creators is almost perfect. The attention is captured since the end, and the figure of Captain Harlock is seen by the eyes of the ""others"", and yet it's heavily present, in the Whole film! You must see it!",positive
"Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ""F""","If you are like me (a passionate DBZ fan who grew up diligently tuning in to every episode) then you'll be ashamed with how this latest instalment scars the legacy created during our childhood. There's getting it wrong and then there's getting it horribly incorrect and DBZ have achieved the latter with this time waster, if you asked me to describe it in 3 words they'd be 'rushed, sloppy' I know that's only 2 words but in truth this film doesn't deserve a third word, it also didn't deserve my attention for however long I spent pushing my eyes towards suicide. I can only think that this was directed and funded by people who dislike DBZ, that would describe the plot with unforgivable holes all over the place and the so called action which is dreadful and painful to watch, Goku probably needs to sue DBZ for terrible misrepresentation of his character. Anyone that says this rushed, unchoreographed, pathetic excuse of a film is good would've been paid a big fee to say so, I can honestly say the best part of this film is the credits, retire now DBZ!!!",negative
"Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ""F""","This is the Dragon Ball Z Movie experience I always wanted. While Battle of Gods was an amazingly fun light-hearted adventure, this is the badass action-packed DBZ that we wanted since the Cell Saga.Goku and Vegeta have now ascended to Gods with Whis as their new master. I absolutely loved the exploration of Goku and Vegeta's character dynamics and development throughout the training scenes, with Whis not only being a physical mentor but a spiritual one as well. Bills provides much of the comedy in his own unique manner as one of the best new DBZ Characters ever. Speaking of new characters, I'm pleasantly surprised by Frieza's new minions, especially Sorbet as he's actually useful throughout the movie and not just fodder like the rest of Frieza's army. The invasion scene was amazing as it put the Z warriors back in the spotlight and gave the movie some much-needed tension. Especially Gohan; not since his fight with Cell has he been this badass!Speaking of badassery, the very definition of the word, Vegeta, finally gets his time to really shine (there are no stupid bingo scenes in this one...) - it is straight up brawls in that over-the-top fashion we all know and love delivered by the Prince of all Saiyans.In the end, the 15th DBZ Film featured the return of the greatest Anime villain of all time: Frieza in a Battle of Gods with the Super Saiyan God Goku. It's just classic!",positive
Telling Tales,"We know the director and writer of 'Bana Masal Anlatma' since 'Leyla and Mecnun' which was the most popular comedy in Turkey, actually still it is. The man who I am talking about is Burak Aksak. It is widely accepted, everyone who watched Leyla and Mecnun, including me, want to watch a film is produced by Burak Aksak. This is his first movie. Pretty successful but the film has lots of mistakes in it. According to me, whole mistakes are acceptable because the director and the movie reach one's goal that is amusing us. If you do not care details of the film, you would have fun. Nonetheless, I would like to talk about the biggest one.The love between Jilet (Gürkan Uygur) and Neriman (Gökçe Bahadır)... We do not know what happened before everything, also we cannot imagine what happen next.On the other hand, It was so ironic that Cengiz Bozkurt is playing a character who is stingy. This was ironic due to he played similar role in Leyla and Mecnun.In addition, all witticisms are staying away from swearing and bad words. Therefore, we can see creativity of the writer who is Burak Aksak.Finally, If you want to laugh and miss Leyla and Mecnun go to the cinema and watch ""Bana Masal Anlatma"". You would not regret but like I said, do not mind about details.",negative
Telling Tales,"Technically flawless, perfectly natural, and hilariously funny.Writer&director Burak Aksak put an extraordinary performance, similar to his previous works like Leyla ile Mecnun and Ben de Özledim. The story is very natural and warmhearted. The change of people, cities, and life itself is portrayed in a both sentimental and amusing way.Acting, directorial technique, screenplay and music score are on a very high level. The actors credit include both young and talented actors beside very experienced and master actors in Turkish Cinema.As a person whose life mostly is based on dramatic events, this movie made me burst into tears with amazingly funny and extremely emotional scenes. I can definitely recommend to go and see this movie with ease, you won't regret.",positive
Air,"A bit of a spoiler- SO SPOILER ALERT After watching this movie, I was surprised at the emotional depth it created with only 3 constant actors. The relationship between Bauer and Cartwright had an interesting feel to it, as like all movies in the beginning everything is run of the mill feel good. But as you see court wright start to unravel, it really digs into the human psyche. While I personally would of liked a different beginning, showing some back story to Bauer, and the apocalypse, it still does enough for you to gain a feel for what kind of person Bauer is. I would of also enjoyed a little more with Bauer and Courtwright ""bonding"". As it sort of takes off fast, and leaves you wanting more for a build up. Without summarizing what happens during the movie, I really enjoyed the ending. To me it really did the character justice (trying not to include names to not spoil anything.) Last point, I really wish they showed the character dealing with the consequences of his actions towards the end, the sort of did that with almost like a quick recap. I really wish they would of invested a little more time in showing the emotions left after. Overall, a good movie. It keeps driving a long, while making you think. I'd suggest it as a good ""date night movie."" As long as you can enjoy a good story and dialogue piece, you should like this one.",negative
Air,"I'm not sure what is with other people, but I thought this movie was very good. Maybe they just can't enjoy something that is not a big blockbuster budget mega action movie.I enjoyed the entire movie. I thought the story, acting, set were all good and kept me watching and thinking the entire time. Never once did I think it was boring or wish that it would hurry up already. I thought both main characters were very good and I was never sure who I really wanted to root for.There were only a few places where I thought things wouldn't have gone the way they did them but maybe that is just me.Yes, I would definitely recommend this movie if you like to think and feel rather than just be entertained.",positive
Earth to Echo,"This movie was cheaply made, along the lines of Paranormal Activity, web cam horror flicks, etc. As has been stated by several other reviewers, it is a cheap knock-off of E.T. We were misled by the poster, which made us feel it would be a great movie for our 7 yr old. NOT! The movie had the characters in bars, teen parties with kissing and alcohol consumption, etc.Parental concerns aside, the movie was nothing more than a hurried, choppy view from a portable cam. Save your money and watch a Youtube video...which is what this 'movie' really was.",negative
Earth to Echo,"When my friends and I were watching this I notice how this was not really our adult style since it seemed like the whole time the kid was filming. Also we didn't really find it all too much exciting of watching but my sister and her friends absolutely loved it! They were laughing a lot by making jokes and they thought the little echo robot was adorable. The part when Munch chases after the truck the girls were joking about when they were calling out for him like ""Munch Munch Munch!"" As in the sound effects of eating. I did laugh along since I have the personality of a kid but I would recommend this movie for teens and kids at sleepovers or get togethers rather than for adults to watch.",positive
Infini,"I watched this movie after somebody said it's similar to Event Horizon. Is it? Well, it's in the same vein, using inter-dimensional travel to create the horror of ""unknown"".. but the ""horror"" isn't really that horrifying.Don't get me wrong, it's still far more competent and entertaining than the pile of sh*t that Prometheus and Alien: Covenant were. Just don't expect it to match Event Horizon.Primarily because, like with most directors/writers, in Infini, they make the mistake of trying to explain too much. Even bigger mistake is to show the enemy itself, but then it'd have to be a psychological horror, which this ain't.Also, I would've preferred they had ended the movie when the hero ""wakes up"" (not a spoiler) instead of them showing more. It'd left the ending up the interpretation, like they say they wanted to.. but I don't think it does. Kinda explains pretty clearly what happened and who changed and why. Kinda disappointed in that.Oh well, still a good movie. Worth watching.",negative
Infini,"I gave this two stars. One day this man that was in his second year studying Philosophy decided he wants to become a painter, but somehow manages to get into Film School instead. He's also slightly autistic. So yeah - he made a movie called ""Infini"". More than half of the movie I did not understand what they were talking about. Endless scenes that should't be there bored me to death. By the end of it I was getting restless and just wanted to gouge my eyes out already. There's something really wrong about this movie. I can't put my finger on it but I think the dialog is all messed up. Words keep coming out of the actor's mouth and they are not gibberish but by the end of the phrase you have absolutely no idea what has been said, what purpose does it serve or how exactly do those words help the viewer understand what is going on on the screen.",positive
Synchronicity,"I was quite shocked to see how low the rating was on this film, and I can only imagine it is because people struggled to keep a grasp on a self entwined looping plot. This is a wormhole based movie, so expect it to be a bit loopy.Probably don't watch it with a girlfriend/wife who isn't in to this genre (they'll not enjoy it and will wreck it for you to by asking for explanations continually... and that would be distracting on a complicated plot which moves fairly swiftly), and it would be best enjoyed without beer (you do need to concentrate to keep up), but other than that I found it excellent. Visually nice, the music was quite 'daft punk'/Tron in places (good on a home cinema system), the actors could act, the female lead was sexy and they tied all the pieces together. What more could you ask for. My 10/10 is probably a bit excessive, I put it this high to try and offset the people who don't understand and have been slating it. In reality it is a solid 8.7/10: not perfect, but getting close.",negative
Synchronicity,"I'm giving it 10 stars because the movie was far better by the end than I thought it would be at the start. From the start though our cinematic sensibilities pick up quickly that there is not an ""Independence Day"" budget attached. With a slew of time-travel themed movies recently relying on great story telling and acting and others on big budgets and vacuous stars I wasn't sure where this one would fall but immediately one was struck by it's style. A noir look and compelling soundtrack. But as the recursive story picked up - well written and a fine cast - any misgivings were forgotten. This is an original story with not just fine twists but also perhaps a first in the time travel genre it's quite sexy. Great chemistry between the two main characters added up to a compelling tale that crossed interestingly between lust and science. Not since Forbidden Planet haha joking but the soundtrack again is worth mentioning and will make a second viewing as enjoyable as the first. Sci-fi has been burdened by the heavy handed scores of John Williams for far too long. Ben Lovett provides a beautifully apt real si-fi soundtrack to a real sci-fi film.Don't be misled by simplistic reviewers, it is a quite clever concoction of ideas but spread out across it's time frame with all the right moments well embedded the story is well told.Jacob Gentry is a person of future interest.",positive
Extraterrestrial,"This teeters on the edge of being a comedic IKWYDLS slasher/horror movie (with aliens in it) as opposed to a full-fledged UFO shocker. It has that commercialized ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" vibe and (intentionally?) comes across as totally over-the-top and cliché. It kicks off in that overplayed fashion, with the auto-tuned emo rock band playing in the SUV, as the college students go on a weekend getaway to their rich parents' cottage. You begin to expect absolutely no character depth and no intelligent dialogue (which is the way the director wanted it I guess). It does unfold in a corny kind of way but it has elements of awesomeness in it. The timing of the jump scares is really good. The moments of alien contact are really cool-looking. Even though it has an almost comedic atmosphere, it still manages to be scary. This is a decent horror movie, with good jump scares....so check it out.

Extraterrestrial,"I saw a lot of negative reviews for this movie, and I just don't get it. I found it far superior to the garbage that Hollywood typically churns out. On a minuscule budget, The Vicious Brothers truly have come through with a frightening and atmospheric sci-fi horror movie. Once the aliens start popping up, there is a true feeling of paranoia and desperation in that log cabin as everyone tries to survive the night. Excellent performances from all of the young leads and a truly daring ending make this a must see. I'll take this movie over Sinister, A Haunting in Connecticut, etc. any day. I want to see more from these directors.....",positive
The Congress,"I have to admit that the first 45 minutes of this movie were quite intriguing. Why Robin Wright would apparently play herself in what is not a real-life story (?) is somewhat bizarre in itself. The concept of her selling her virtual reality bio-scan to the movie studio was thought-provoking and you imagined (or hoped!) the movie developing into something even more interesting and insightful...After 45 minutes you enter into phase 2 of this movie as it enters cartoon(ish) territory. Trying to make sense of it all (in my mind) I've surmised that you're meant to imagine virtual reality movies denigrating into cartoons (to save the studio even more money?). I'm not sure if that was the intention of the director & writers, that's just me trying to make sense of it all.The cartoon(ish) remainder of the movie didn't do anything for me as it was all just a tad too fantastical on whatever level you're meant to interpret the later half of this movie.4 stars go solely to Robin Wright for promising so much more in the first 45 minutes...",negative
The Congress,"After reading so many complaints posted on the web about the lack of originality in modern movies, one would think there would be a lot of support and praise towards a film that tries to do something different and unique, but it seems that complex (or merely unconventional) narratives are loathed here on IMDb. But then again, this is the same website that gives extremely inflated ratings to a lot of generic superhero flicks. It is also the only website where a show like ""Mr. Pickles"" could be rated so high.Anyway, ""The Congress"" is a wonderful film. Of all the movies that combined live-action with animation through the history of cinema, this might be my favorite. Plot-wise, ""The Congress"" might be closer to movies like ""Inland Empire"" rather than ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"". And the balance between the live-action parts with the animation is simply excellent.Some people say that it would have been better if the ""Hallucination"" parts were done in live-action, but I disagree: The animation sequences (Which make a marvelous combination of psychedelia with an art style reminiscent of the work of Max Fleischer) not only gives the story a proper dream-like feel to the story (Opposed to a dry and forgettable portrayal of dreams as it was seen in movies like ""Inception"") but also serve as a subtle commentary about modern-day obsession with escapism: It's something admirably subtle the way the thin line between fantasy and reality fades away as the plot of the film progresses, until the bitter reality is finally showed in a rather heartbreaking manner. Like at the end of ""Waltz with Bashir"", when the animation changes into live-action, we as viewers are forced to confront a harsh reality that cannot be ignored, and that reality is that living with our backs turned to the problems of today only will have dire consequences in the future, and we will have to deal with those consequences in one way or another. I guess that a message like that could be hard to swallow for many viewers, but I personally think that in this day and age, a message like that it's more necessary than ever.I hope ""The Congress"" gets eventually vindicated by history. Maybe in the future, people will be able to appreciate more its daring qualities. For now at least, the future of cinema seems bleak, with all the same generic stuff making billions at the box office while the actually challenging movies are perpetually ignored. A shame, really.",positive
Krrish 3,"Literally, each and every character, most of the action scenes, and dialogs in the film are inspired, or say blatantly copied from the Hollywood superhero films. X Men, Batman, Superman.. You name a comic hero, you got him in this film. Even the background score is lifted from Inception and The Dark Knight. And the worst part is that this plagiarism didn't pay off in the end. The screenplay was very poor. Action sequences looked too much fabricated, super slow, and lacked depth. It's a congery of B-grade visual effects, melodrama, and toothless humor.Final word: If you're are an eleven year old with no Hollywood experience, it's a treat for you. Or else, don't bother watching it.",negative
Krrish 3,"Just watched the movie. I think this movie is the first step of bollywood in making superhero movies. Hrithik roshan was fabulous in three different roles. He was childish as rohit,sweet&cute as krishna and menacing as krrish. I was moved when rohit died. Because rohit mehra was one of my favorite character which was portrayed by hrithik. Finally, it is good family entertainer. But it lacks somewhere to attract the youth. Kangana Ranaut was superb as Kaya. Vivek oberio was also good as Kaal. It could have been a better movie. Another drawback is that it has inspired by x-men,superman. Which questions the originality of the characters in the movie.",positive
Reign of the Supermen,"Hated it! Hated it! Hated it!
The original writers of this story (Dan Jurgens, Karl Kesel, Jerry Ordway, Louise Simonson & Roger Stern) should be pissed. DC butchered this completely. I expected so much more and was sadly disappointed.
The original Death & Return of Superman (back in 1992 &'93) was one of the best Superman stories I have ever read and this paled in comparison. They ruined the story, they ruined the original villain (who was a GREAT villain who would never do someone else bidding) and turned him into an underling. Then they used lazy writing to add a new villain that had absolutely nothing to due with the source material.
I thought they had learned something from their 1st attempt at this with Superman/ Doomsday dvd in 2007 but I guess I was wrong.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!!!
I encourage anyone who wants a great Superman story to find the original story in the Return of Superman trade paperback or the novel The Death & Life of Superman by Roger Stern (the novel does include the battle with Doomsday). Both are incredible. It might take you a little longer to read it but it will be worth it.",negative

The only good thing is the impressive CGI, animations and details are really incredible. The rest is totally pointless. Basic plot line, one dimensional characters, absurd and not realistic situations. Plot is the same story told over and over again over the games: new villain spreads a virus, heroes fight zombies, heroes fight a final boss and save the city. There is absolutely no twist or a new focus on story that could make it more interesting.Only recommended for Resident Evil hardcore fans, casual viewers be warned: this is a total waste of time.",negative
Resident Evil: Vendetta,"I went to the one night only premiere of Resident Evil: Vendetta tonight the third C.G.I. motion picture movie of Resident Evil and I can honestly say is the best of the three.The movie deliver in more ways than one that fans of the Resident Evil series will super appreciate.First off we got to talk about how amazing the movie looks this is some of the most Phenomenal animation works I ever saw the characters and environments are so realistic that you can often forget that you're watching a Computer Generated Animated Movie the movie crew hired actors for motion capture to show case how real the characters look and move on screen they all deserve points for doing such a great job to make the movie look so great.The voice acting is top notch with in my opinion the voice work and characters Chris Redfield (Voiced by Kevin Dorman) Rebecca Chambers (Voiced by Erin Cahill) Leon S.Kennedy (Voiced by Matthew Mercer) Glenn Arias (Voiced by John DeMita)bringing great performances that really shows amazing work it makes you feel like you really watching a drama play done so well the voice work the cast does is so well done with the writing being very smart the writers took their time that's for sure.The story really is powerful throughout with the writing again being well through out. The cast performances also helps the story makes you draw into the plot to wonder what will happen next.The action in the movie is awesome it felt like you're playing the game and the effects are impressive barely enough time to rest as the action keeps you on the edge of your seat as you wait to see what goes on next.The only thing this movie needs is a mic drop because it really show why Resident Evil has had such a success the movie is made for fans of movies and Resident Evil. I will no doubt be glad to watch this movie over and over again.With amazing C.G.I Animation,Excellent Voice acting, Strong powerful story and action that leaves your jaw drop you really will love this movie.I give Resident Evil: Vendetta an 10 out of 10",positive
The Survivalist,Judging by the poster this looked like a great post apocalypse drama. Instead it was a pile of pretentious artsy fartsy crap that moved along at a snails pace and got nowhere. Bloke lives in a hut after some disaster or other and grows food using his own waste. Bit like the Martian but without a script. Some woman turns up with her daughter and offers sex for food and board. Daughter duly obliges and the three settle down to a life of monotony and some sex. Then some dreary dialogue later bloke kills woman to ease her pain as she was dying and then all hell breaks loose as the hut gets invaded and everyone dies I think. Then daughter who survived the slaughter goes somewhere and does something and then it ends. I may be a bit loose on what actually happened as I was half asleep due to boredom and missed a couple of scenes but basically it's another pile of too clever drivel from the art squad who will tell us we are not intelligent enough to understand it and call it a masterpiece. Seen too many like this and am bored with them but am sure there will be another one along soon to stun us with it's brilliance.,negative
The Survivalist,"Haunting post apocalyptic tale. Sublimely acted, directed, and photographed. May not be for everyone, but a must for anyone who loves film and is bored of the spate of fantasy and YA dystopian dramas that are all too prevalent. This movie can be seen as both a futuristic nightmare and as a cautionary tale about our wasting of our resources and the dangers that loom. Martin McCann provides the heart and soul of the film in the title role and he is certainly destined for stardom. All the performances are brave and gut wrenching. Given the darkness of the film and its graphic visuals I am not sure if this film can find a wide audience but it is guaranteed to become a festival favorite and cult success.",positive
Comet,"One of the most pretentious movies I have ever watched. The main guy character is an unlikable, self-important asshat right from the start, in a way that should be obvious to everybody - except, apparently, the main girl character. She likes it, goes right along with his ""I'm the smartest man alive"" schtick, and delivers some crazy chick attitude in return. The writers worked hard to make narcissistic, sociopathic character traits appear quirky and cute. They're not. They're narcissistic and sociopathic. Couple that with clumsy exposition, wooden dialogue, and wannabe ""aha!"" moments, and it all turns into a major trainwreck. I'm guessing the actors did the best with what they were given to work with. However, the result should appear highly unlikable to any human being with a shred of actual empathy. Comet is a movie that looks good on paper, but unfortunately, does not deliver on its promise at all. Unless we're supposed to find these two painfully annoying, in which case, congratulations.",negative
Comet,"Hollywood movies rarely move me as the formula used is predictable, with most endings being predictable shortly into the film. If you are looking for the Americana white picket fence house in the suburbs, two kids and a dog relationship this is not for you. Comet is a statement on love between two people looking for love who have the unsocial ability to speak their mind, the truth. Truth hurts, and without the ""skills"" to cushion their raw feelings they do hurt each other. Its a beautiful refreshing approach to viewing a relationship, magically crafted by the filmmakers by interweaving the 6 year timeline of their relationship leading up to the final scenes. A film to show this narrative needed two actors who could bring the characters to life and make you believe, outstandingly accomplished by Justin Long and Emmy Rossum. Please realize most of this entire film is carried by these two actors, the supporting cast is small but excellent, the cinematography is captivatingly beautiful, and the musical score integrated perfectly, adding up to a great movie experience. I gave this film a 10, which I never do, to counterbalance the rating of people who obviously did not take the time to take this journey.

They Call Me Jeeg,"Plain awful. Do anything else, throw marshmallows at stray dogs, pinch wallets, try to pee in a beer can, sell your body in parts. Anything is better than watching a badly acted and awfully written Kick-Ass/Hancock clone. Terrible B movie. At least Kick-Ass was funny and ironic, Hancock had great special effects, this dough is even trying to be dramatic. The only character building up throughout the movie is the loony girl, and she gets killed for no reason whatsoever. Her acting is dreadful (apparently she comes from a TV reality show), but her character is the only element of interest in the movie. Santamaria is just as wooden as Pinocchio. After she dies anybody else might as well turn into flaming zombies and bite everyone, you wouldn't give a rat's behind, anyway. The wooden puppet playing the bad guy should have been court martialed for his insanely bad acting. Steer clear, it is awful.",negative

This looked like a real National product to me, devoid of major foreign influences: it recalled much more of Pasolini's suburbs or of Pazienza's bad boys than of Deadpool or Kick-Ass. Which is something I liked very much.A catching opening scene, a solid plot, some very good actors and a great villain (Fabbio: Luca Marinelli won a David for this performance) will make you overlook some lack of craftsmanship in special effects or in action scenes.And originality is priceless.

Extinction,"The zombie genre has been bled dry, nothing new there; there is literally nothing new anyone can eke anymore out of it to make another great zombie flick. I certainly haven't seen a good zombie flick in over a decade. Instead of being creative by coming up with new creepy concepts, the vast majority of ""film-makers"" are content to milk the last molecules out of zombie and vampire genres. Only two adults (at the outset) are left in the world – yet they don't talk. That's a whole new level of dumb they're trying to sell, just so they can do injustice to that overrated movie term called ""dramatic conflict"". The notion that these two guys won't talk due to something that occurred eons ago, regarding some floozy from years back, is too stupid. It just doesn't wash. No matter what argument or hatred is going on between grown men, an extraordinary situation such as a zombapocalypse should have brought them together, at least to the point where they can talk and grudgingly co-operate. Beggars can't be choosers, yet the writer thinks they can. People forgive each other under much less stressful conditions, when they don't have to, let alone in an unpopulated, frozen wasteland in which co-operation is essential to survival.What's with this ""double whammy"" apocalypse anyway? We've got a zombapocalypse AND a new ice age! I'd be curious to know WHY a zombie virus would cause such a radical shift in global temperature. Any explanations, movie? No explanation. Movie refuses to discuss this matter with me. Movie knows it's wrong. Movie is a dummie. If anything, there should be global warming, not an ice age. Here's why: since zombies eat much more than humans (bless their wicked metabolism) – and yet remain skinny – this means they must do the brownie much more often than humans. The logical conclusion is that they fart more – which in turn would make the planet warmer, not colder. Am I right or am I right?Nor can I accept the fact that TWO major events occur at the SAME day, after nine years of relative monotony: first the hippie gets attacked by a new breed of zombie, only to be contacted by radio minutes later - for the FIRST TIME in nine years – by another survivor. That's coincidenceitatis being brought to a level of absurdity that's an insult to viewers, even zombie viewers many of whom are not unlike the movie's zombies themselves.It gets better. The little girl, who had been obedient for so many years, not leaving the grounds as ordered, suddenly decided it was OK to go for a NIGHT stroll – only a day after seeing a zombie for the first time! So let me get this right, movie: BEFORE seeing any ""live"" zombies, the girl didn't have that much interest in venturing outside, but as soon as she witnessed a zombie attack her neighbour, she somehow found that ENCOURAGING? ""Hmmm, I used to think it wasn't safe leaving the house, but now that I've seen an alien-looking, deformed, vicious zombie with huge teeth attack another human right in front of my eyes – to which I reacted with shock, dismay and disgust - now I guess it's OK to go out. It's much safer out there with a zombie on the loose."" Great logic, movie. Are we to believe all 9 year-olds are completely retarded, devoid of even the most basic survival instincts?Still, at least she isn't dumb enough to have herself locked up in a basement; but that's precisely what her guardian does. There's hardly an experienced film fan that didn't see THAT stupid plot-device leading to the girl's endangerment.Just exactly who or what threatens our less-than-merry bunch? A bunch of freakin' gollums, that's what. In recent years a dull fad has engulfed the world of horror flicks, a fad that is making many of them a lot less interesting: the gollum trend. We've seen gollum-like monsters in the overrated ""Descent"", we've seen them in ""The Hallow"", in ""From the Dark"", and many other recent monster movies. Must we have the SAME kind of monsters in every film?Besides, if these zombie gollums evolved during the new ice age, shouldn't they have grown fur at least? No: the movie thinks it makes more sense to make them totally hairless! Now, that's a logical evolution right there. Darwin would be laughing his ass off. Clearly, American screenwriters have devolved to the state of an amoeba, because so few of them think anymore. Horror, fantasy, and sci-fi films are getting dumber with every new generation of devolved film-makers.It mystifies me why the survivors have to resort to hand-to-hand combat with the gollums when they'd previously armed themselves to the hilt. And when they do finally get to shoot the gollums, they run out of ammo! I mean, here we have a world in which time is the one commodity the humans have in abundance, yet they never actually bothered to make sure they have sufficient supplies of ammunition. This is the kind of nonsense I'm talking about, a clear indicator that screenwriters have devolved from average morons who made average movies in the 40s and 50s to the sub-par imbeciles who never run through a script more than 2-3 times before submitting it to some daft director.",negative
Extinction,"This movie could have been so much more. it had all the elements to end up a masterpiece, but for whatever reasons the actions seem incomplete. The potential in this movie was beyond awesome, unfortunately they only scratched the surface.The beginning of the movie wasn't all that promising but once I had a view at the first snow creature I was amazed how well it looked.. from afar. Once they got close, it lost all the fear that got me excited at first. I'm not saying they did a bad job, but the effects and costumes felt outdated and unpolished.The acting was above average, even though some character decisions were sloppy here and there, never the less the movie did connect with the human touch after 9 years of survival in the wilderness with 2 men and a child.The plot is unique and original but a bit rushed, maybe too many elements were included and there wasn't enough time to explore them in depth and evolve a better bond between them. One solid example would be the radio voices that were suggesting dementia, but they were there only for a few minutes in the movie then they weren't mentioned at all.The movie is worth watching, even though the ending was kind of messy with little information what was going on. Maybe one day someone will try to remake it into something better and add more refined details that were skipped or rushed in this movie.",positive
Rememory,"Rememory - A sci-fi thriller with borrowed plot points and an unsatisfying conclusion. It's definitely worth the price of admission, however, being that it's free on Google Play before it comes out in theaters.The movie centers around an invention that allows people to view memories from any point in their life. It doesn't get bogged down in the science behind it, allowing the story to unfold. The problem is, it's not a very good story.Although the memories of these characters are on full display, I never felt like I got to know any of them. The main character, played by Peter Dinklage, is a figurine maker, but is seemingly Sherlock Holmes as well. I don't know how much PTO comes with a job like that, but he spends all his time investigating a murder on his own volition. It never feels like he's truly given a challenge at any point, and the movie is too busy trying to throw you off the scent that it doesn't seem to care.One thing that jumps out, however, is that the movie makes zero reference to the fact that Peter Dinklage is a little person. His stature is often the main focus of his character on Game of Thrones, but any actor could have gotten this role. Given what he lays out on screen here, the overall movie notwithstanding, it's clear why he earned the part.Another positive performance is offered by the late Anton Yelchin. He plays a troubled young man on the brink of total mental collapse. He put all he had into his small role, showing that his untimely death robbed us of decades of potential in the world of cinema.If you want to see a better execution of the technology featured in this movie, I would direct you to the BBC (now Netflix) anthology series, Black Mirror. Each episode is its own independent story, so you can jump in at any point. The one entitled 'The Entire History of You' delves deeper into the topic, and also happens to be my favorite of the entire series. Yes, Rememory is currently free, but you already have Netflix on every device you own. Queue it up. 5.25/10",negative
Rememory,"I am an easy sucker for any sort of film involving memories (Memento, Rashomon, etcetera) and this one had a plot synopsis that just begged me to take it in. It also made me think of the movie ""The Discovery"" about a scientist who supposedly finds proof of the afterlife, and while many people are committing suicide, he develops a machine that lets him apparently view a recently deceased person's memories.
I would have liked to see some manner of mystery or even a bit of incoherence done with the memories that are played back in this film. They all look too perfect; perfect vision, perfect audio, camera angles that would require the person to be behaving very oddly (such as an extreme closeup of someone's fingers playing the piano would've meant the viewer would've had their head resting on the piano). The intro video the scientist Gordon Dunn shows at a presentation looks absolutely nothing like recorded memories, and completely like something you'd see in a GoPro promo or some other HD digital camera technology.
The thing about memories, even fresh and recent ones (at least in my experience) is that they can often be an incoherent mess. Sometimes I won't remember large portions of conversations, but manage to somehow understand the conversation that was unfolding. I can ""feel"" certain attitudes and concepts and sensations rather than hear them. Sometimes the memories are completely wrong, as well; sometimes it's foggy and blue on a summer day, and sometimes just by the act of trying to remember something, I don't so much ""remember"" as create a fantastical re-construction of the memory.
Nothing of that sort is explored in this movie, and it's quite a shame, because the story that they did go for is very plain and straight-forward. The memories just become a sidepiece and a means of confirming people's stories in a murder investigation being conducted by one incredibly lucky and bold man.
Peter Dinklage is that man, playing Samuel Bloom, some guy whose brother dies in a car accident and who now he is obsessed with getting into contact with Gordon Dunn to use his machine so he can view his own memories, obsessed with remembering what his brother's last words were as he was dying.
In the process, he takes it upon himself to pretend to be various people, question people involved in Dunn's memory experimentation, use the machine to confirm their stories, and so on. He is perfectly at ease using a fake name and taking advantage of having watched people's memories before meeting them so as to better pass himself off as someone who may have worked for Dunn or with one of the subjects.
But this also makes for another thing that the movie just passes over, to its detriment. Peter Dinklage is a little person. There's no mistaking it when you see him. This never comes up in a derogatory or limiting way for him or his character; his character could just as easily be played by any other actor of any other size and nothing at all would change about the film or the character.
But while that's a good thing for him as an actor, it leads to some really odd moments in the movie, as well as a plothole or two, where Peter Dinklage's height would either be a liability for his character, or a benefit for certain characters who are trying to track him down. Knowing that he is a little person would make finding him significantly easier, especially when he thrusts himself into the middle of the murder investigation by stealing the memory recording machine.
It feels like the film was more focused on its plot, blissfully unaware of how predictable it was, rather than filling out the details that could have made the movie much more intriguing and fun to watch. The desire for Sam to revisit his brother's death just to remember his last words loses a significant amount of impact when those words are actually revealed, and it turns out you already figured it out right at the start of the movie when the death happened. It hardly feels fair to label it as a spoiler because of how predictable and ultimately insignificant it was. 
It also feels like the filmmaker at some point realized this was a very insipid line to follow, and rather than commit to it in some mildly nihilistic way, they tack on a pointless twist, one which not only plays little to no role in the ending, but one for which, due to them ignoring Peter Dinklage's height, becomes a rather significant plothole.
Overall, this was a movie that had a fun and novel concept to play with, toyed with us with the potential of this concept (the idea of a world in which anyone's memories could be viewed on the spot by others in perfect HD) and proceeded to do very very little with it, more focused on its boring and predictable story than with running wild with its imagination and doing something really memorable.",positive
Batman Ninja,"The art style pays homage to traditional painters like Hokusai and kayosai. Japanese print art and caligraphy are used to get effect to make this one of the best looking Batman animated films released in the last decade. Batmans costumes alone are superb from his great blue glowing tech suit in the beginning to the ninja clothing at the end. Joker too gets a lavish makeover that'll make toy companies stress for ages trying to replicate.
Unfortunately the plot goes from the implausible time travel plot (but ok I'll go with it) to out right bat crap insane in the last 20 minutes or so. It seems to want to do a bit for every kind of fan of japanese anime. One minute it's a stunning ninja scroll style martial arts romp, next it's a transformers/gundam style robot slugfest. 
I honestly started laughing loudly when the army of monkeys (yes you read that right) all join together to make one big giant armoured monkey (yet again you are reading this correctly) to fight a huge mecha robot made up of the top 5 batman villains houses (seriously... it's their homes!).
I was laughing really hard but nothing would prepare me for what happened next! As the giant armoured monkey began to lose to the giant house monster a swarm of bats surrounded the mecha money and turned it into a colossal batman called ""bat god"".
It was at this point I yelled ""oh jesus god no!"" And damn near wet my trousers laughing so hard. I don't think that was supposed to be the desired effect.
I suspect it will work well for a bunch of drunk guys looking for a movie to lampoon and laugh at like Tommy Wiseau's The Room or Samurai Cop. The dialogue feels hokey in places but this could be due to having to translate directly from japanese but sometimes it's too on the nose. Again it looks fantastic but a change in art style right in the middle really jars. After a huge battle between joker and batman on a boat, red hood is strolling along a country footpath and comes across a man and his wife farming. He then accuses the man of being the joker and begins to beat him. Batman appears from nowhere and stops him saying that the farmer used to be the joker but he isn't anymore and they should leave the old farmer/former joker alone. There is no explanation as to what the time frame is from the last scene to this scene is and almost feels like it doesn't belong or they tacked it on realising there was a gaping plothole as to why joker randomly goes missing for a while and then shows up at the end just to fight batman. There is fun to be had with this film and again it looks so great but it throws almost every kind of japanese anime into the mix and really pushes the envelope of a realistic setting. This wouldn't too much of a problem but there feels like two conflicting styles of storytelling happening, one based around batman being stripped of all his tech to find out what he is without it, ala Iron Man 3 and rhe other has giant monkey monsters, submarines, huge mounted gatling guns, spiritually aware bats, hive minded monkeys and fighting houses. Altogether it leaves for a ""what the hell was that feeling"" and finally ends with Batman returning to Gotham, alfred using a horse drawn batmobile garnished in feudal japanese decor being driven through the streets of gotham with bruce being clearly visible just sitting there! So now anyone that sees the horse drawn batmobile going through the streets can clearly see bruce wayne and now know who Batman is WTF?!
Some things you can put to artistic interpretation but that is just absolutely and fundamentally not Batman. 
Just buy a poster and imagine what the film it could have been.",negative
Batman Ninja,"The main problem with ""Batman Ninja"" is the advertising. Make no mistake, this is a kids film, and had the trailers offered glimpses of its *ahem* wackier moments, serious Batfans would have known to leave well alone. By the end, ""Batman Ninja"" closer resembles the Power Rangers than Batman.I will start with ""Batman Ninja""s sole positive: its subtle combination of hand-drawn anime comic and 3D art styles is gorgeous. I'd go as far as saying this is the most painstakingly beautiful DC animation I've seen.The voice acting is fine, with exception to the worst casting misstep of the Joker since Suicide Squad. The actor Tony Hale portrays him with an irritating manic energy that somehow makes Harley Quinn seem restrained. This was the first indication to me that Batman Ninja would be little more than Saturday morning cartoon fare.The dialogue and characterisations are surprisingly poor throughout. My biggest reservation of cross-pollinating Western and Eastern stories is the lack of true understanding from either side. And so it is in this case. Batman is a fool, unworthy of his reputation as a world-class detective. The Joker is an annoying court jester with none of the more subversive qualities we have come to expect. Catwoman is usually consistent with previous incarnations, but written without depth (as are the other supporting characters).The idea of Batman's technology being stripped from him, forcing him to adapt to his new (or rather, old) environment, is genuinely fascinating. But any fan will tell you that technology does not define the Batman, but rather allow him to operate on a larger scale. Seeing him suffer a mini personality crisis following the destruction of his toys was odd, to say the least.Finally, ""Batman Ninja"" reintroduces the cheesy kitsch of a bygone era, which Warner Bros should know by now is a mistake (Schumacher). The Batman 60s theme tune even plays at one point, just in case it was all too subtle.Warner's animation department is pretty much the only thing they have going for them as far as DC are concerned, but Batman Ninja is a big backwards step, and a wasted opportunity. A one-shot story with a Batman born and raised in feudal, corrupt Tokugawa Japan could have been truly special.",positive
[REC] 4: Apocalypse,"I have never really loved mainstream Hollywood horror movies, and REC's first installment is one of my favorites. While the first film (c. 2007) of the franchise is arguably the best, there is a real debate about the third one, which talks altogether about something else. But, in here, the director-actress duo have successfully closed a good franchise by continuing stories from the second and third films.We are now in a quarantined ship where doctors are researching on a serum that will serve as an antidote to the parasite and its bacteria. Our reporter friend, two Military soldiers, doctors, and the ship's crew fret it out in a ""survival of the fittest"" kinda situation as the subject of the research runs amok. As a zombie apocalypse ensues, alas! without the found footage element, but with security surveillance element, we find out that the truth is not what it seemed to be. And there is more to what happened at the end of installment two.Although the film starts pretty slowly, it becomes spot on after thirty or so minutes. Lots of unwanted blood baths and absurd dialogs may keep you from continuing, but if you are brave enough and forgo these horror film requisites, REC 4 will turn out to be real entertainment. The dark setting helps as the franchise probably ends here.BOTTOM LINE: If you have been following the franchise, this will make an amazing watch with friends and family. Happy New Year 2015!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOFore/Violence: Infinity",negative
[REC] 4: Apocalypse,"Looking forward to see REC 4 ones it was over I was left with mixed emotions. The unique story of REC was gone. By now you do know how the zombies or infected do look and move and the surprises seen in part 1 and 2 are gone. It's of course normal that by part 4 you have seen it all before but even as it has a few intense moments it's the use of lighting and the shots that made it hard to sit through.It starts off rather well because we go back to the apartment were Ángela Vidal (Manuela Velasco) was taken by the infested and disappeared at the end of part 1. They do rescue her not without a few attacks by the way. She's been taken to a cargo on the ocean were they are doing experiments on her and the soldiers who has taken her out of the apartment. It's even funny when suddenly an old lady comes across the story who is asking were the honeymoon takes place, a wink to REC 2. But by then the story weakens a bit because once you see the lab you know what is going to happen. When an experiment goes wrong an infected monkey breaks out of it's cage and spreads the disease. But what could have been a surprising reprise turned into an annoying experience. Lights do flash a lot and the camera moves a lot and is zoomed in for most of the time so it's a on and off of seeing what is going on. The reason is rather simple, the surprise of REC couldn't be done again. It even reminded me a lot of Alien (1979) because Angela becomes the hero and walks around in her undershirt a lot so Ripley isn't that far away. There's a bit of explanation what makes the virus and the end is open so it's off to REC 5 I guess. But I hope that the suspense and the creepy look of the infected like in REC is back there. Don't get me wrong. It isn't that bad after all but due the use of zoomed in shaky camera shots it didn't infected me .Gore 2/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",positive
Batman and Harley Quinn,"I paid twenty bucks to see this movie in the cinema. Twenty bucks to watch Harley Quinn farting in the Batmobile and Batman telling Nightwing it ""smells like discipline."" I'm serious. The movie was bad enough before that with Harley complaining about being treated like a sex object only to then have her way with Nightwing tied to her bed, but the fart scene was as much as I could take. Yes, I endured the rest of this in order to review it but nothing could save it by then. Poor writing, too many convenient plot devices and a really lazy ending. Plus a post-credit sequence that went for 3.5 minutes and had zero relevance to the actual plot of the movie! I really hope this isn't the direction the DC animated universe is heading, because if that's the case I'm done with it.",negative
Batman and Harley Quinn,"I don't understand the low rating?Batman and Harley Quinn was fun, sexy, and very entertaining to watch. I really liked Melissa Rauch as Harley Quinn, and I really like it when she tied up Nightwing and seduces him. The story and plot are easy to follow along. Harley working alongside Batman and Nightwing is a great touch, and I wonder if Nightwing and Harley will continue to be friends with benefits as long as she stays on her meds? It seems Batman just doesn't trust or thinks Harley is sane enough to make it a permanent relationship. I don't really know what's going to happen, I'm new to the Batman DVD's and haven't really been interested in them until lately.",positive
24,"'24' by Vikram K Kumar is essentially a family drama centered around the idea of time-travel. However, the film also includes elements of romance, action and thrills in ample measures, even though the bulk of the screen time is spent on emphasizing the significance of familial bonds (Appa-Amma-Thaatha-Maama-Maami and so on).The director, who recently made the Telugu drama 'Manam' still seems slightly hungover from it. He has proved that he loves playing with the concept of time (13B, Manam). But the surprise in the screenplay here comes in the form of sci-fi elements. Tamil cinema (and Suriya himself of course!) has been churning out many sci-fi thrillers in recent times (Enthiran, Dashavathaaram, 7aum Arivu, Maattraann, Anegan, Indru Netru Naalai to name a few). Some of these were characterized by an overdone formulaic story replete with masala, while a few of them stood out for their innovative screenplays and seamless blend of sci-fi with other genres.'24' marks a return to the sci-fi genre for Suriya. Hats off to the man for taking up this expensive and ambitious project after many a recent failure (Maasss, Anjaan, Maattraann, 7aum Arivu) and funding it himself. I will not shy away from saying that the production values look top-notch and the CGI is mostly sans notable flaws. The sets boast of decorative extravagance and are mostly a treat to the eyes, at times resembling the lavishness of Shankar films. The cinematography by Tirru is nothing short of spectacular in the initial portions. It would also warrant special mention that different color-tones are attributed to different characters with respect to their portrayal in the film. For instance, the intelligent, yet tender (and at times, clumsy) Dr. Sethuraman (Suriya) and his wife (played by Nithya Menen in an extended cameo) gleam in lighter shades (of golden yellow) while his evil brother Aathreya is burnished in darker shades (of brown).The story is really not that path-breaking to be honest but still holds narrative interest owing to the director's firm grip on attention levels of the audience, by way of utilizing its star lead's boyish charm during the romantic interludes, as well as a welcome change of seeing him play the character of a psychotic antagonist. Aathreya wants his brother's time-travelling device (which happens to be a watch) by hook or by crook and is even willing to murder his brother and his family for the same. Suriya depicts the antagonist Aathreya in a style of his own and the actor seemingly looks like he had fun doing so. The devilish grin and the plain stares are placed at apt junctures by the actor. Suriya, the romantic charmer that he is, uses his potential to the maximum in the scenes with Samantha, although, however cute they may look initially, start to wear out and eventually end up bland. The romance is underplayed in the first half, with Mani (son of Dr. Sethuraman, again played by Suriya) using his time-travel watch to woo Sathya through various instances of play-pause-repeat. ""I'm a watch mechanic madam, enakku ithellaam sarva sadhaaranamaana vishayam"" is a line that brings both laughs and shrugs. Some of the wooing methods deployed here are fun to watch though, and this makes the first half a mildly entertaining affair. The amazing opening segment as well as intriguing interval block are admittedly where the writer-director scores brownie points.The film slows down considerably in initial portion of the second half with family sentiments (even though Saranya Ponvannan is consistently marvellous at her job of exuding maternal warmth!) and downright- silly romance segments thrown in simply for the purpose of extending the run-time. Thankfully, it does not take too long for the sci-fi element to bounce back and take its rightful position in the film and the viewer is rewarded with a feel-good (rather feel- great!) climax. However, it needs be bluntly accepted before and after watching the film that a lot of it works purely on coincidences rather than logic or situational coherence.A R Rahman's music+BGM is certainly a plus-factor although personally, I am of the opinion that a sci-fi film would be much better off without so many song-n-dance routines. If you, as a viewer, are able to forego these minor masalaic tropes and are okay with a run-time of 160 mins (editing dept. could have done better!), then you are in for a decently satisfying sci-fi treat!",negative
24,"This being my first review on IMDb,I'd like to be impartial.Masterpiece.The film's carved so perfectly you'll be satisfied once you come out of the theater. First thing,the story,it'll be what you expect from a time-travel movie.It's not exaggeration when I compare this movie with ""Predestination"" and ""Triangle"".The Interval scene will keep you guessing and if you can guess it,you're wrong anyways. Second thing,Suriya's versatility.Suriya is a perfect cast because you love him and hate him at the same time because he is the protagonist as well as the antagonist. Third thing,background score.Well,what more can you expect from the legend himself. If you see someone giving a rating less than 9,suggest him to watch the movie again because he didn't get it the first time.Thank you for the classic,Vikram Kumar.",positive

The Starving Games,"A few weeks ago, upon discovering known and universally panned parody filmmakers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer were making a parody of the popular franchise The Hunger Games, I sent out a message on Twitter I thought would be seen as encouraging to some. It read, ""Encouragement to young filmmakers: whatever you're writing now is infinitely better than the new parody film The Starving Games. Soon after sending the tweet, I received a reply from the film's official Twitter reading, ""Great! We're working on The Starving Games 2!"" The fact that the PR/marketing campaign for the picture needs to reply in a smarmy way to negative feedback online about their film shows about as much maturity on their part as the film at hand. Unsurprisingly, The Starving Games is another miserable endeavor of a parody movie, directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the same men who have brought you Date Movie, Epic Movie, Vampires Suck, among other installments of the dead parody genre. That's right, I'm referring to the genre as dead now. Consider my reviews of A Haunted House and Movie 43 (which I'll throw in the same genre since it revolves around many self-referential skits and lampoons A-list actors) the genre's funeral service and this one a visit to its gravesite. What has happened to a genre so promising and so filled with life? The simple answer is it has been reduced to what appears to be a cinematic competition between writers to incorporate as many pop culture and movie references in one film as possible. In the first few minutes of The Starving Games, we are annihilated as viewers by the abundance of references thrown at us, as if it's a commercial break on Television in mid-December and we're trying to decide on what toy to buy our children. The Friedberg and Seltzer formula is to have no continuity, no logic, and no wit in their story. Just clobber together every successful film character, pop culture icon, current celebrity, etc into roughly eighty minutes and string it along with a loose plot and hope someone laughs (or enough sales come through to cash a large check).As inferred by the title, the film is one long parody of the popular book/film franchise The Hunger Games, with the protagonist of Katniss Evergreen now under the name ""Kantmiss Evershot,"" an inept archer who now must fight for her life in the game where her and another opponent must kill one another in The 75th Annual Starving Games. The winner receives an old ham, a coupon for a foot-long sub sandwich, and a partially eaten pickle. The person who sits through this film in its redundant, eighty minute glory gets nothing but a shorter amount of time left in their day.With all the disgustingly unfunny references, I'm glad this film was shot, edited, and completed before Miley Cyrus and the ""twerking"" phenomenon became mainstream. If I had to witness something of that caliber in a film that already breathlessly tries to include the ""Gangnam Style"" musician Psy, the whole Avengers squad, Harry Potter and his friends (who are told to get out of the film because their franchise has ended), and the cast of action movie legends from The Expendables, I would've probably given up.The reason why I resist discrediting or shattering the likely large egos of directors Friedberg and Seltzer is because, well, why bother? They have found a formula that pays big money and have capitalized off of the lowest common denominator of wit and intelligence there is in the cinematic world. I am anticipating reviews of The Starving Games that consist of death threats, comments about the devolution of humor because of the directors' films, and remarks of their worthlessness because of their filmography. Reviews of their films have become as predictable as the films they make, so why bother attacking them? All I can say is be grateful this one is confined to a video-on-demand released and a very limited theatrical release, as opposed to their other films which garnered wide releases. Let's hope their window of release just becomes smaller and smaller over time.The Starving Games and films like it don't make me angry anymore. They just make me sad. It makes me upset to see films like these gain an audience of young teens who are already experiencing shorter attention spans thanks to Television and the internet. I'd let my twelve year old child watch the original Halloween before a film by Friedberg and Seltzer. Or, better yet, the original Airplane! or The Naked Gun series, both starring the gifted comedy actor Leslie Nelson. Those films worked because they spoofed their own genres and didn't try to incorporate every current celebrity and movie figure that has rose to prominence since their last film. There is no reason anyone should see The Starving Games, but, oh, people will.Run and tweet that.Starring: Maiara Walsh, Brant Daugherty, and Cody Christian. Directed by: Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer.",negative
The Starving Games,"I don't really understand what people expect to find when they decide to watch movies like this. I do know what I can expect, because they are always the same. If you like this type of ridiculous, non-intelligent, dirty comedy, good. If not, why do you bother?I had a good few laughs with this movie, and it entertained me more than other films that apparently are great (see pacific rim). This movie is not pretentious nor tries to amuse you with new, all fantastic jokes. It doesn't need much budget and it's something I appreciate. It's also better than other predecessors such as Disaster Movie or Epic Movie (those were actually quite bad). As I said before: if you like the Scary Movie saga and related spoof movies, go for it.Now, 10 is probably a bit overrated, but I can't stand the 3 or so score that this movie shows at the moment, while other trash is in the 7s range.I expect a lot of clicks on the NO button regarding if this review was useful to you.

Zashchitniki,"from the heavy handed introduction / title sequence involving unpleasant manipulation of Humans, I knew I was in for a treat. My viewing pleasure was massively enhanced by the appallingly translated subtitles, (talking about a daughter, saying ""he did this and died"" or something along those lines) The frequent, perplexing ""gazing at another's grief"" scenes with characters that looked as though they had all traces of expression CGI'd from their faces. News bulletins that looked as if the broadcasters didn't really know how serious all this might be. Arsus (the bear) seemed to be suffering some kind of existential crisis going on most of the time, even when he was a bear, and the grinning oaf that seemed to be the bad guy was fantastic, posturing with his hands in the air whilst manipulating his machines. So in all seriousness, one of the best / worst films I have ever experienced in my life of watching Really Bad science fiction films. and believe me this was Really Bad. Great Fun.",positive
Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV,"The film is great, amazing graphics, amazing actor rendering, amazing everything except a decent story for anyone that is not going to play the FFXV game.I would really give it a 10 however they just left it open for the game (hence the video at the end of the credits), quite a few questions unanswered too (for example what were the demons, how were they summoned, where did they come from?). I had no idea what was happening half the time, why were they fighting, why were some characters so important. All I can say about this film is that it is a introduction to the FFXV game, if you don't own a PS4 or an Xbox One are a gamer or have no intention of purchasing FFXV then this will be just a mediocre very nice polished CGI.I have no intention in buying the game and I feel duped, like a marketing ploy. I won't be buying a console and the game just because of a movie.I think by making the movie an introduction to the game they are alienating anyone not playing the games (at least previous movies were stand alones). The only thing I can suggest is to start reading more on Wiki and once the game is out hunt around on Youtube to see all videos from the game to understand the story better. Obviously this is what I will be doing as they left me wanting more. I wish they would make a sequel once the game has been out to tie things together.By all means, watch it, it is well worth it for the animation, amazing, however bear in mind that it is just an introduction to the FFXV game. If you are someone that has played the previous FF installments, loves the FF universe, pre-ordered and is looking forward to the new FFXV game then this is exactly for you and I highly recommend it.

Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV,"I have seen several movies regarding or based on video game, yet none not even close of Kingslaive. I also saw the other two Final Fantasy movies and neither of them is even half good as this one. This isn't a masterpiece overall, has its own flawes, but nonetheless it's a great and solid movie, worth watching and rewatching.
The CGI is spectaculos, so realistic and well-made, carrying you truly into a story, a fantasy. We see new power additions to the word, the eye-catching warp magic forged by the blink dagger of the glaive which is a pretty cool thing to watch.
But above all are the character, many of them very interesting -I really wanted to know even more about each of them- and the story itself. Some said the plot is not coherent enough. I think those people did not paid enough atention, especially at the prologue. Kingsglaive is not just a story about battles and special effects, it's a story about duty, about courage, about sacrificies and responsabilities. You care for those characters and their fates. It tells a good and engaging story, something that movies nowadays completly lacking. It has soul and sentiment. It has a message.

It raises the questions: Is it too late to change? Is it too late to realise your mistakes and atone for them? What starts off slow pays off if you stick with it. As you progress through the journey with James and Rose, you'll find yourself caring more and more about them. The climax is worth it and if you don't shed a tear, you'd hardly be human. This is without a doubt one of the best hidden gems I have ever seen. Truly a magnificent experience on a limited budget, but so much more.

Of course this is not the Oscar league, please understand that I'm comparing to similar productions.The plot is far from novel: We have the involuntary protagonists, a phenomenon with a vessel that uses the phenomenon, a couple of persons with unknown objectives, and an abundance of different world settings.

Singularity,"This film is so bad I can't even be bothered stringing how much I hate this film into cogent sentences.So, 97 years after the bots take over you're telling me that the windows on the shops are crystal clean? You're telling me that despite no new clothes being manufactured the human characters look like they've just got a whole new wardrobe from GAP? That nearly 100 years of neglect has seen no collapsed roofs, no weeds growing from gutters, and fields that look like they've been fallow for a couple of years? That street signs, railings, window shutters, metal roll shutters have absolutely no signs of rust? That despite the bot driven apocalypse, the main female lead still has time to obviously dye her hair? In the scenes running through forests, they follow well worn and undergrowth free paths.... worn and maintained by whom exactly? Bots? In one of the opening scenes, a shop is engulfed in ivy inside yet in one of the later scenes, a house described as 'really old' has perfectly white whitewashed walls, and inside looks pristine - photographs aren't faded, glass cabinets haven't a speck of dust on them... in fact there is no dust, not even a cob web! And given that the house hasn't been heated for 97 years, it's amazing that there is no damp whatsoever. 97 year old Polaroid film works and, it must be energizer, because the batteries are still fresh. Despite being out in the wilds for days on end the male lead is always perfectly cleanly shaven. Even when he is woken from sleep he has been mysteriously shaved - then again he is a robot - a fact that the writers are at pains to have us aware of from the outset with the laboured 'no food for me' scene - funny then that when the girl falls asleep on his chest she doesn't notice that he doesn't need to breathe (we presume) And then, when they meet some nasty humans, they are all covered in stubble, dirt and worn clothes - oh my, so original.The male lead gets tied up in a brand spanking new rope. I mean, this thing clearly was just bought from a shop on the day... and the rope magically moves from one scene to the next... did they take lunch in the middle of shooting the 'tied up in brand new rope' scenes? Maybe they should have...The male lead is only capable of two expressions - eyes normal and eyes bursting out of his head. There is nothing in between and the rest of his face is entirely pointless. Lucky for him that the dialogue doesn't require much else. Actually, I'm not giving him credit... he can do a variation on these two expressions above including with mouth open and with mouth shut.The female lead should take urgent note that crying involves water coming from the eyes. You can't snivel and gasp for air, and then expect to look authentic with a perfectly dry face. Special effects are dire - in the opening scenes burning buildings look like someone went mad with the Photoshop clone tool. Explosions don't cast any light on objects that are close by and clouds of dense smoke don't cast any shadows and dissipate in moments leaving no trace. Enormous bots appear to defy the laws of physics and move through dense forestry without causing a single tree to move. 'Whats in your chest' scene - great work on the 97 year old straw bales that look to have been made in the last week... and the plentiful fresh straw on the ground in the barn... just lazy... Lighting.... I mean really.... what is happening with the lighting? In a dark and dingy forest, and it looks like two blazing follow spots behind the cameras.... just cheap and nasty.The characters are so poorly developed that their behaviour is schizophrenic at best.Continuity is a joke - in the opening scenes we see buildings burnt to to the ground, yet in later scenes, and I mean 97 years later scenes, they are visible in the background, with lights on inside. Really, 97 years after the rise of the bots, they are still using lights? Who is changing the bulbs? Bot janitor? Who even makes the bulbs?The bots themselves. If you're looking for humans, perhaps IR might be better than visible light to detect them? I think it's utterly lazy that the main feature of the film, that drives the whole storyline, the bots, are so poor.After leaving the 'facility' (you just know that's what they call it), they walk through a field of corn ready to be harvested.

Kill Command,"Mind the spoiler alert.So we have a group of soldiers send to a training island to test their skills against their replacements aka droids. Because there is an excessive amount of data being learned by the droids the tech girl who designed and programmed them is send along with them to asses the product.They easily take out some old versions and think they're done. All the wile outwards communication is being blocked but they don't seem to mind that and just stand around a lot. Don't get me wrong the movie is quite decent, way better than most of the other ""low budget"" sci-fi creations.Anyhow here are a few things I didn't like about the movie. The girl/creator is way to silent. Even when it's abundantly clear something is wrong she still keeps quiet wile all the information they can get would have been helpful. Mayor annoyance.At some point they walk into the storage facility for the droids not activated at that time. Did they turn this into an advantage, NO! They could have destroyed them as all of them are equipped with a self-destruct EMP bomb to prevent their tech from falling into enemy hands.Or better jet as the creator is there with them she could have disconnected them from the network and given them a command to protect the humans. Did I mention she has a chip in her head/neck that gives her the ability to interact with those droids through a neural interface. So something like that really shouldn't have been hard to do and would have made it a much more realistic final battle if you have a good portion of the enemy taken out and then some left to battle by human hands.For some reason 1 of the droids is the boss. Even though they're networked and at some point 3 of the same boss type droids are activated. Anyway they salvage an EMP bomb from one of the destroyed droids somehow up it's power (don't ask how) and manage to take the boss out. Sacrificing herself as her chip gets affected too. But guess what that thing made to take out the tech to prevent it from falling into enemy hands doesn't work the boss gets up again and now goes after the creator who plays dead and then blasts a hole though it's head. Then her chip gives out completely and she dies. Guess what happens next, the darn boss droid gets up again and manages with his last ""breath"" to upload itself into her destroyed chip!? So quite a bit of ridiculousness at the end and if that wasn't bad enough it also leaves an open ending. No one likes those, hell personally that's for a large part why I don't watch horror flicks anymore as they nearly always end without an end.",negative
Kill Command,"I wasn't expecting too much from ""Kill Command"" when I stumbled upon it on Netflix, expecting it to be your typical run of the mill low budget sci fi actioner. Well, I will admit that the movie did exceed my expectations, albeit in one area. That area being the look of the movie. The movie is well photographed, and the other production values are top notch, particularly the special effects depicting the homicidal robots the protagonists have to fight off.So what's the problem? Well, although the movie looks good, it does not give the viewer the feeling a movie like this needs to give. For starters, the movie is quite slow, particularly in the first thirty minutes. Although the movie picks up the pace slightly after that point, the movie makes a serious stumble with the action sequences that then unfold. The action simply isn't that involving. It feels routine at best, and you never feel the protagonists' peril or panic. Add in a far too long running time (100 minutes), the viewing experience ends up being somewhat of a lengthy slog.",positive
Turbo Kid,"Let's make a movie about the future, but set it in the past and make it look like it was set even further in the past.

For one thing, it's a co-production of Canada and New Zealand. Since it's technically a foreign film, it has no MPAA rating (but if it did, it would surely be rated ""R""). The movie has three directors, François Simard, Anouk Whissell and Yoann-Karl Whissell, all three of which also share credit for the screenplay, and all appear in the movie in small roles. What's more, the cinematographer, Jean-Philippe Bernier, is also one of the two people who did the film's score, which is a highly unusual combination of jobs. Now, let's get back to that highly unusual pitch summary in the first sentence of this paragraph.""Turbo Kid"" is a post-apocalyptic action movie set in the ""future"" year of 1997. That actually makes sense when you know that the film intentionally looks and sounds like it was made in the early 1980s. Stating it another way, this movie is ""retro futuristic"". It's a lot like many of the movies made in the late 70s and early 80s. In fact, the year picked for the story's setting, 1997, is the same year in which 1981's classic dystopian action thriller ""Escape from New York"" takes place. And that's not the only connection between other movies of this film's sub-genre. There are passing verbal references and visuals that are subtle shout-outs to movies like ""Soylent Green"" and ""The Terminator"". What's not so subtle is the strong and obvious influence of another post-apocalyptic film series from the 1980s (rebooted in 2015) on the plot, setting and costumes in this movie. As ""Wired"" magazine said, it's ""'Mad Max' on a BMX"".Munro Chambers plays a character simply called ""The Kid"", an orphaned teen just trying to survive in a land laid waste by something (?) which led to the end of civilized society. The Kid scavenges items that he can ""sell"" to his world's version of a pawn broker (Romano Ozari) for that most precious of commodities – water. The water that exists is under the control of a sadistic general called Zeus (Michael Ironside). As he brags to his ""minions"" (NOT the cute kind), he not only provides their liquid sustenance, but their entertainment as well. He sponsors regular violent and bloody gladiatorial-like contests between his ""henchmen"" (better word) and those unfortunate enough to have double-crossed Zeus or just crossed his path.When he's not scavenging, The Kid is obsessing over his favorite superhero, someone called ""Turbo Rider"". The Kid has various Turbo Rider memorabilia in his house and then gets a hold of an old Turbo Rider comic book, which he seems to value almost as much as staying hydrated. As he's sitting in an old playground reading his comic book aloud to himself, he's approached by a girl named Apple (played by Canadian actress Laurence Leboeuf) who wants to be friends. She's impossibly chipper (either gratingly or adorably, depending on your point of view) and she may or may not be a cold-blooded killer. But she insists on hanging out with The Kid, and, well, friends are hard to come by in this terrible future-past (or is it past-future?), so he lets her tag along as he scavenges.As dangerous as this time and place is, you have to be tough to survive. The Kid teaches Apple his rules for survival and soon the two of them meet someone even tougher than The Kid – a cowboy type named Frederic (Aaron Jeffery) who's an arm-wrestling champion and the closest thing that the few decent people left alive have to a protector. That is, until The Kid becomes Turbo Kid. He finds a costume that makes him look and feel like his hero, Turbo Man. The costume doesn't help him fly or anything, but it does have a pretty serious weapon built into one of the arms. The Kid becomes Turbo Kid just in the nick of time. For different reasons, Apple and Frederic both run afoul of Zeus and they need some serious turbo-charged rescuing! But even if Turbo Kid can free his only two friends from the clutches of Zeus, he'd likely be pretty ticked off and would probably want to hunt them down and, you know, kill them all.It's kind of a tough thing to judge this movie. On the one hand, it is very effective at evoking the feeling of cheesy early-80s future schlock. On the other hand, the violence (albeit comic violence) can be a bit excessive – unless you find dismemberment and gallons of fake blood shooting everywhere to be amusing. Still, the graphic destruction of so many human bodies notwithstanding, this movie deserves credit for being very different from any other 2015 release and it is more entertaining than not. All this comes out to a mild recommendation – with a strong warning. Considering all the blood and guts, a kids' movie this is not, but adults (especially those who like the cheesier movies of the 70s and 80s, and enjoy a good splatter flick) may find seeing ""Turbo Kid"" to be a blast. This B-movie gets a ""B"".",negative
Turbo Kid,"If your primary movie-going experience is watching Hollywood blockbusters with vin diesel, this may not be your cup of tea, but for everyone else, this film destroys it.This film is pure gold, 80's indulgent, brain melting gore, a love story, and even somewhat artistic at times.I won't drone on, but this film i destined to be a staple in horror/art house/comedy cinema.It is fast-paced, adorable, hilarious, brutal, and has a charm that only filmmakers in love with their genres can produce. This is not Hollywood, but you wouldn't know it. Often times I can either purchase a film to see it, or watch it streaming but, it's a rare occasion when i see a film and have to instantly purchase it.",positive
The Machine,"The Machine is a rather successful attempt at implementing hard science fiction tendencies with a cyberpunk aesthetic. It may not be particularly adroit in terms of human and AI relationships, but I appreciate the rigor of the scientific explanation for the artificial intelligence. The film really excels at this in the beginning when Vincent conducts his own Turing tests as part of a secret headhunting operation. Then as he meets Ava things start taking a problematic turn. The military-industrial complex is invoked, but its purpose is sort of shadowy and never is contextualized in a way that would make the narrative more coherent.The questioning of human identity is the strongest point of the film, but I suppose that, at the very core, this film was more interested in being a thriller, rather than an exploration of the philosophical concepts.",negative
The Machine,"I actually enjoyed this film more than I thought I would, although the first half-hour didn't really work on me. I could see the low-budget in the initial shots. Because of this, I wasn't fully paying attention. However, I kept finding that I needed to keep rewinding to check out what I missed since the plot was actually moving along quite fast.Then at about the half-hour point, this movie really captured and kept my attention throughout. I really like the acting and the way the lead actress moved (including her dance and combat movements).As for scenes, the interior shots were set up well. The dark lighting was really effective and the eye glows worked very well. Editing was actually pretty quick and the story was compelling. I was actually concerned for the characters (which doesn't seem to happen for me very often in movies today).One of the real standouts is the visual effects work. It's phenomenal (especially considering the low budget). The intro credits look fantastic, the robot-creation sequence is just amazing, and the glow effect on the robot was pretty phenomenal. I have a feeling that the VFX teams did some serious overtime on this one. I also suspect the effects houses didn't make much on this production although I suspect the shots they did will make great portfolio material.If I had a qualm with this movie, it's the soundtrack. On one hand, it uses very cool CS80 sounds, similar to Blade Runner. Unfortunately the shots that used this instrument didn't have the 'weight' to warrant that sound. Believe me, I love that synth, but it needs to be used strategically. Then there's the other style of music which is typical of movies like Her or Ex Machina. I didn't think that score worked particularly well either. Perhaps something in-between the two styles would have worked better. The Blade Runner style was more mysterious and haunting than this film's presentation and the more modern score was too light and nondescript for the shots it was attached to. Regardless, there were sections of music that did work nicely. I seem to recall the music near the end of the film being spot-on.In general, this is a film that I can recommend to people who like science fiction and the topic of A.I., androids, cyborgs, etc.... It's actually quite a thoughtful film. Interestingly, I found that I prefer this movie over both Her and Ex Machina.",positive
Radius,"Interesting at first. Kept looking for a big reveal. Constantly questioning the characters actions and reasoning. Why did they do that, or why did they say that. Their actions at times didn't make any sense. The ending was weak, an easy way out and fell flat. Disappointing. Would not recommend.",negative
Radius,"As a person who rarely watches any regular television programming, both Diego Klattenhoff who play Liam and Charlotte Sullivan who plays Jane, had me hooked instantly. They were both a combination of new faces (for me) and exceptional acting. The scenery, the pace of the film and the storyline flowed well, carrying me along, trying to figure out where it all would lead. The ending completely unexpected; a nice change from the usual run-of-the-mill Sci-Fi film. I highly recommend this film. Everything about it was a pleasure to watch.",positive
Max Steel,"One of the worst super hero movie of 2016. Extremely slow to tell a story, no action (except for the last few mins of the movie), too many annoying flash back. Seem like the director wasn't sure if he wants to make a sci-fi movie, chic flix, or comedy.. it turns out to be a big mess that drag on and on. People walking out in the middle of the movie, if it wasn't for my 11 year old, I would have done the same.. After the movie, my 11 year old even comment how bad the movie was! Here's an example of how slow the movie was.. the first min. of the movie, it also indicate Max has super power, it took about 30 mins of the movie to finally confirm his super power. Then another 40 mins of the movie to talk about nothing much with flash back.. and finally 5 mins of action (fight scene) to beat the bad guy. When you think it's all over.. they spend another 15 mins to put some unnecessary romance and filler to make the movie 92mins long, so that you don't think the movie is being too short.",negative
Max Steel,"Well lets take it one step at a time. 1) the movie starts well with a mystery going on around our main character and a good enough introduction of the rest of the characters. 2) the plot is good but it doesn't fit only to one movie so i hope for another one. 3) the end, well i am not gonna spoil this but the movie prepares the audience for the end (that makes the movie predictable -ish) but who doesn't like to say ""i knew it"". I liked max and defensively loved steel, i hope there was more about the background of steel and max but i put my faith on the next movie if there is going to be any. It's a movie decent enough to go on a sequel. So i am giving it a 10 because for the kind of movie it is it's very good.",positive
Next Gen,"First off. The good. Robots are pretty awesome. Some silly robots like the noodle bots and the toothbrush bot but generally they are cool. Especially the main robot. They are well incorporated into a futuristic background that doesn't seem too far off. However. The major let down is the highly unlikeable lead. She is a terrible character with nothing but rottenness in her personality. She is a bully, and unkind. And she justifies that because ""oh her father left when she was younger"". So it is just acceptable that she acts up, hurts others, blames all her misfortunes on everyone else, play guilt mind games. She never learns from her mistakes instead takes it out on everyone else around her. She is not even a little self aware nor does she accepts any responsibility for her own actions. She does not have any redeemable quality. As you watch the movie, instead of making you feel sympathetic to her and engage in her adventure, I find that I am filled with so much hate for her that I actually want to see her fail. I want her to be punished, and that does not make a good story if it makes the viewers hate the lead and want to see her fail! I find myself rooting for the villian and that almost never happens!If the story was just about the robot it would have been 10 stars.",negative
Next Gen,"Aside from the film involving robots with feelings this is far from Big Hero 6. I love BH6 and this film is definitely up there with it. Some reviews below were rated poorly based on the main character Mai being an angry brat but that IS her character and if she made you feel that way then her job was complete. Her actions were intended to upset you and make you disagree with them so great job with that! Those that said the film is too violent are just being overly sensitive. Look at all the kids films/shows out there that are just as violent, if not more - Power Rangers, DragonBallZ,Tom & Jerry, TMNT, The Lion King, etc - Stop being so sensitive people. I thought Momo the dog was the highlight of the show. The beeping was hilarious and we don't really know what is being said, we're just assuming it was cussing but it really added a lot of humor to the film.I really liked how the film depicted humans as being so dependent and addicted to the robots, much like how we are so addicted to our phones and other technology now. The animation was amazing, kudos to Tangent studios for a great job! Overall the film is fantastic for both kids and adults.",positive
Area 51,"Bought this film from Sky. What a load of crap. Only watched it because I'd paid money for it and thought it might get better. Unfortunately, it only got worse. If this had been free, I would have deleted it within 30 mins. Please, please, please, do not waste any of your life watching this utter crap. This Film Is Complete And Utter Rubbish. Quite honestly I think it was written and acted as if this was your first drama project in secondary school. You're given an idea and had to develop it. If I had been their teacher, I would have gave them an F, in fact it would have been ungraded. It was like they'd ran out of ideas at the end, or the school bell had rung and they had to make an ending. It was that bad, that there isn't even a soundtrack when the titles rolled at the end.",negative
Area 51,"First off; I'm a massive found footage fan. Always have been since the initial Blair Witch Project (Which I also thought was a masterpiece of a movie - Especially for the budget.) Even now, I still think it's completely relevant to the horror genre.Area 51 isn't perfect. I don't think any movie is; possibly with the exception of Fight Club. However it's the best piece of cinema I've seen lately. I think it's ludicrous that Area 51 has received a 4.3 rating when movies that are much worse (YellowBrickRoad) receive a much higher rating.Not even gonna lie; when I watched YellowBrickRoad I was expecting it to pick up any moment. The entire time. I was left feeling robbed, cheated and in a state of confusion - What the hell was that garbage?It seems reviewers on here only tend to give high ratings to the ""Artsy"" films with subtle hints at trivial things.. Like a plot. Or any body whatsoever to the movie..This was entertaining. It did the job and definitely does not deserve a 4.3 rating.",positive
Monsters: Dark Continent,"What a load of pretentious, art w*nk nonsense this film really is.It's bad enough that the story is paper thin and the characters are as unlikeable as an upset stomach (one minute gangsta tough, the next screaming like babies) but the direction is shocking.It's like a frustrated art student trying out every possible style of image capture. Long shots, close shots, lens flare, angled, shaky cam, slow mo and none of them working.One pointless scene of a helicopter taking off showed it's ascent from at least 10 different angles - outside looking up, inside looking out, inside looking inside, outside different angle etc etc.Every character must have had at least two shots of them silent screaming from the Dummies Guide to filming internal angst.Things aren't explained, geography is not established and you can almost feel the makers telegraphing their contempt to the audience that 'if you don't get this, you're too stupid'.It's not engaging, thought provoking or entertaining. And when it's finished all you can contemplate is the utter pointlessness of the whole film.I know many complain of studio execs interfering with a film but you really have to question who greenlit this laughable project or signed off the finished product for general release.Whoever it was can't tell the difference between a movie and a flickerbook of cool filtered Instagram pics.",negative
Monsters: Dark Continent,"Just saw the Empire Magazine Premiere of this film at the aptly named Empire Leicester Square. As with a with other London Film Festival offerings a brief introduction normally with a few words from the director, and the odd actor or screenwriter was done. The introduction was kicked off by scruffiest person I have seen all year from Empire Magazine (to be fair to him he did admit as much) Then there was a vote of thanks by the director Tom Green who then proceeded to, I exaggerate not, thank EVERY person involved in the movie (I wondered what the end credits were for) this went on forever it seemed. All the films stars were paraded on the stage all suited and booted and all MALE. That aside I settled down to watch the film. First let's go back to the Empire Magazine guy who ""warns"" that this film was a war move. Back to the film It starts off with our ""heroes"" involved in a conflict with insurgents in the Middle East and spends the ENTIRE film as a war movie with the Monsters in the background. We were warned remember? Now I thought war movie in the context of he title Monsters meant Alien vs. Humans not war movie as in Hurt Locker. So you can gather by now that I did not like the movie, the acting was so clichéd it hurt, the script and dialogue was all over the place and it tried to be too many things at the same: War movie, Sci-Fi, War Movie, Drama, War Movie, Action, War Movie, Road Movie, War Movie (did I say war movie?). I do not go into this film expecting to watch, wait for it a WAR MOVIE. I have seen else where on this site that this film is better than the first one. IT IS NOT, the original was not exactly a flawless piece or work, but its main appeal was that it was made on a shoestring budget with a director's vision, wit and a wing and a prayer. This film was empty and for all the bullets flying around was frankly quite boring. It only lit up when the Monsters of the title Remember? Appeared. To be brutality honest THE MONSTERS were this film's BEST ACTORS. To be fair to this film, and I'm really trying to be, the monster effects were excellent. But the monsters had very little airtime, it looked like the creatures had other engagements and had no time to remains in this particular movie!",positive
A-X-L,"Okay I did enjoy A-X-L romping around the desert with miles on his dirt bike, flying through the air as they bonded. A kid and his billion dollar super dog.With that out of the way, at about 40 minutes into the movie I realized two things. This militarized billion dollar dog weapon, soooo scary looking with super growling 'teeth' was as dangerous as a kitten. Second was the scene where super dog faces off with the evil 18 year old. Does it matter what weapon the 18 year old has? After all he's facing a billion dollar 'weapon of war', right? Suffice to say A-X-L is no match for a teenager. Later, when he targets an evil teen he is unable to stop the teen from running away and diving under a car. At no time does this screenplay have A-X-L take down even a single evil peson whether evil teen or evil military contractor who created him. Sure, he can run and bark like heck... but no where do we see a billion dollar weapon in action.Also, one could ask why A-X-L escapes from his creators in the first place?
Not a clue. After all, he was created to save the lives of our soldiers at war. Kind of a noble invention, yet as the movie begins he's gon AWOL. Why would he not wish to return to his creator and his mission to save our soldiers lives. That is in fact his prime directive, to bond with a single solder at war. It's not like he's a nuclear bomb we could debate. Again, screwy screenplay where evil creator is not really evil. One could say that A-X-L going AWOL was super dog being very, very bad dog!The notion one could build or rebuild an A-X-L in a garage with a soldering iron also left me scratching my head.Fun idea with an awful, nonsensical screenplay.",negative
A-X-L,My husband and I both loved it. But the true judge was our 7 year old who stayed quiet and tuned into this movie the whole time,positive
Monster Trucks,"I'm actually quite surprised Chris Wedge, the director who gave us the first Ice Age and Robots giving us his first live action family feature. Now it might have looked good on paper and could have possibly been better as an animated feature but this movie is a monster shame. X-Men's Havoc, Lucas Till takes the lead role as disgruntled, unhappy teenage Tripp who works at the local scrapyard which also serves his hobby of building his own truck. Jane Levy impressed me earlier this year with Don't Breathe and it's hard to believe that they're both the same actress, here being the sweet yet geeky town girl who has a keen interest in Tripp. It's a silly plot for a silly film but is too far fetched and weak with too many plot holes in surprised the film stayed together. Strange and undiscovered, intelligent creatures accidentally get released from their underground habitat. Feasting on oil and having an unlikely ability to power vehicles, basically a slimy horse with a metal shell. There's a few surprises of a supporting cast with me thinking ""oh look, it's so and so"" but none help prop up the all-round poor performance. I actually wonder what convinced them to star in this film. It must have been tricky to come up with a monster that's grotesque yet cute and friendly at the same in the end resembling a Jabba the Hutt with the characteristics of Toothless and E.T. Actually the films has some elements of both previously mentioned but more Iron Giant and Mac And Me. The special effects were good, not perfect but served the film well enough. The stunt driving was impressive and offers the most fun in the story as the film lacked any real comedy value. The soundtrack is okay but nothing memorable from David Sardy.It's possible this film was doomed from the beginning having problems with post-production that kept pushing the release dates back to well over a year. Even Nickelodeon had pulled out at one stage. It's unfortunately a step backwards for Wedge and for everyone involved. This might be a film they could possibly want to forget about but, it actually serves a purpose and the much younger audiences actually seemed to enjoy it. But I'm sorry Wedge, if the future of your live action films end up like this, I suggest sticking to the drawing board. It's brainless and more for the younger geeks among us. Running Time: 4 The Cast: 6 Performance: 4 Direction: 3 Story: 3 Script: 3 Creativity: 4 Soundtrack: 4 Job Description: 2 The Extra Bonus Points: -5 for being a terrible idea even for a kid's film. 28% 3/10",negative
Monster Trucks,"I took my youngest child, six years old (nearly seven), to see this yesterday. He bounced around like Tigger the whole way through, and only paused to turn around once in a while to tell me ""This is the best movie ever!"" This coming from a boy who loves everything from Harry Potter, Star Wars, Top Gear (and Grand Tour), to Tractor Ted and Octonauts.As an adult, it was a perfectly acceptable way to spend a couple of hours enjoying the company of my child. There's not a lot to the story, so if you've seen the trailer you won't be surprised. The monsters straddle the line well between being ""monstrous"" and cute (my boy acted suitably scared until it became clear that the monsters were on the good side, after which he loved them).He came out of the cinema asking when it would be available on DVD, so on balance a glowing recommendation from a 6 year old and a warm fuzzy one from me.",positive
The Lazarus Effect,"The Lazarus Effect (2015) ** (out of 4) A group of scientist discover a formula that could help bring the dead back to life. The main scientist Frank (Mark Duplass) and his fiancé (Olivia Wilde) mess up when signing their contract and end up getting kicked out of the laboratory. Needing to get enough of their records to carry on, the group sneak back into the lab but after an accident Frank's fiancé is killed. They decide to use the formula to bring her back to life but things don't go as planned.THE LAZARUS EFFECT has a few interesting ideas and some great performances, which keep it from being a complete trainwreck but there's no question that the film doesn't take its subject serious enough to have the film work. There's no question that there are elements of FLATLINERS here but people will also be thinking of LUCY, which was released the previous year as this film.It should be noted that without the end credits this movie runs just 76 minutes, which is extremely short in today's time. I personally love shorter movies but this one here is just so uneven that the film pretty much ends just as you feel it should be taking off. I say that because there are some interesting ideas about Heaven and Hell here but sadly very few of them are fully explored because once the fiancé is brought back to life the film turns into a rather generic horror movie. I'm not sure why the screenplay would introduce such good idea but then not do anything with them and especially since the film is so short and could have been expanded on.The performances in the film is what save it and help carry the material. Both Duplass and Wilde are very good and especially believable in their roles. Supporting players Sarah Bolger, Evan Peters and Donald Glover are also very good. Technically speaking the film features a nice score, good cinematography and the director certainly makes a professional looking film. With that said, THE LAZARUS EFFECT completely falls apart during the final fifteen minutes, which is a real shame.",negative
The Lazarus Effect,"I've long stopped going to horror movies expecting to get scared, or see anything remotely decent. Instead I view them as comedy movies, trying to entertain myself by how bad the films are, so it's pretty safe to say my expectations when seeing a horror movie are about as low as it gets and yet ""The Lazarus Effect"" still left me astonished by just how bad, uninteresting and not even remotely scary it was. There was nothing new or unique about the movie, and literally the only aspect of the movie that could be considered scary (if you're not already desensitized to those, like most people) were the jump scares, and even those were predictable.I've been disappointed by a lot of movies, but this is thee first time it was bad enough that I actually took the time to write out a review.",positive

Unfortunately, they didn't have the funds or imagination. The result compares unfavorably with the average movie made for the syfi channel.Thomas Jayne was obviously embarrassed to be in this since he obscured his looks in shambling meth addict wardrobe and makeup. Bruce Willis didn't have that luxury so he was forced to show his disdain by delivering his lines deadpan like a first table reading of the script.",negative
Vice,"If you are an IMDb ""reviewer in training,"" this is a great place to start. It is sorta like a ""starter hill"" in skiing, just a nice gentle downhill slope to start your review on, and then your own momentum will take you safely to the bottom, err, end.These are my notes, to get you going * I can claim to have seen Westworld when released in a real theatre. However in a world where today's viewers have the attention span of a bumblebee, that was a long long time ago. Hollywood can remake or re-imagine it if they like. In point of fact, the core idea (seen only in the first 20 minutes, before the film seems to run out of creativity) of redoing it from the POV of the robots (oops, ""artificials"") is bloody clever and deserved much more traction than it got.* did you know Bruce Willis is 60 years old? He has been the backbone of the industry for decades (seems like just yesterday he jumped from MOONLIGHTING to DIE HARD) but he is not getting the plum roles anymore. The real bitter and ugly irony here is that Jane is doing the Willis role and not very well. If you are an alert reviewer, in every scene where Jane and Willis face off (not many) you ache to hit the pause button and imagine what the film would be like if they reversed roles.* Childers is gorgeous. But you knew that. One of the requirements to get the role is that you had to be gorgeous. And if you get trapped in a theatre on a rainy afternoon in Cleveland, there are worse ways to pass the time than to watch a gorgeous actress trying to bootstrap her career to the next level.Those are your starter notes for your review, young scribe. Good luck.",positive
Flu,"I'm generally a fan of Korean movies but this one is terrible. The exposition is a parade of clichés. The quirky buddies meet the feisty but sexy lady (who has a cute daughter). Then everyone in Bundang, a satellite city of Seoul, gets the flu and starts dying. Of course this is a rip-off of every Quarantine/Contagion movie you've ever seen but it's got none of the character/plot or budget to pull it off. The director is from the A.D.D. school of direction and although Jang Hyuk does good work as the fireman it's wasted. None of the actors embarrass themselves here to be fair. But there's no time for character development which is problematic as the movie has no plot instead relying on personal drama to carry the day. Sure an advanced ability to suspend disbelief is often a necessity in Korean movies but the idea that a virus could be contained in Bundang is just plain silly. About the only thing that amused me in this movie was the undercurrent of xenophobia. Of course Vietnamese workers are the source of the deadly virus (the Vietnamese provide a growing emigrant workforce as well as mail order brides in Korea) and the scene where the ""good"" Korean President threatens to shoot down the ""bad"" American jet bombers (ordered to bomb a mob threatening to break the quarantine cordon)doesn't say much for a generation that prefer to ignore how the Korean War was won. In a country where few will have seen Contagion and xenophobia is considered a virtue it's hardly surprising this movie has found popularity but for a foreign audience this movie is best avoided.",negative
Flu,"If you like apocalyptic stuff, you will love this movie.

Gantz: O,"Gantz was a good read as a manga because you could skip trough the lamer parts and just view is as a pure action title - which was its strongest part. The fights were entertaining, the art was lovely dark, some of the ideas were actually decently original and the gory 'live or die' policy gave the series a nice feel. This 3DCGI movie on the other hand doesn't really deliver any of that. It does have very successful 3D design and for once the CGI doesn't look too awkward either. Definitely a better pic for that matter than Space Pirate Captain Harlock or Final Fantasy Kinsglaive. As an adaptation, for person like me who is familiar with all of these source materials, I have to say Gantz doesn't work as a stand alone title at all. So others shouldn't bother and Gantz fans will be pleased to some extend at least? I am not sure about that either. This movie is the least mature take on the Gantz franchise for sure. Much like with Berserk Golden Age Arc movies (yes, not the new hideous series, but the movies) - this series seems now like a shonen title aimed for teens while it is originally meant to be mature content for adults. Other than few blood spats and Berserk sex scenes, you will not find much mature and brutal content in them. Some would agree those won't work with CGI well, so it is better not to even try.That leaves me to the question, who is the target audience for this title? I guess the fact that Netflix got it soon after release widely, implies how niche audience we are talking about. On the other hand, I would have never watched this movie if it hadn't been on Netflix recommendations. In the end, I will recommend this piece to everyone who enjoys cyberpunk.",negative
Gantz: O,"Gantz is one of my favourites ( or probably my favourite) manga ever. I've following Hiroya Oku ( the guy who created Gantz) work for years. When i knew about a new Gantz Film coming this year I was very excited but, at the same time, I didn't think that we could watch this film on theatres in Argentina. Well I was wrong, we could due anifest Latin America. What can I say about Gantz O? The animation is AMAZING. The best that i've seen for a long time. The fights, superb . Oka , ""George"" and Nobuo , members of the sadistic and cool Osaka team, have the best fights of the movie. The music fits really well. The Osaka mission is know as one of the best of the manga and it was a really clever choice to pick it up and make a movie about it. About Kato, he is the hero in this movie and you'll end loving him. And the aliens... they're bizarre, scary and really violent. Just like in the manga. To sum up, if you have the opportunity, watch it. Yeah, there're some missing characters, but this movie was so good, so entertaining, that you will forget that in seconds.",positive
After the Dark,"It starts off with a fairly interesting premise, some philosophy students debating moral issues at the end of the world. But it quickly falls down when it succumbs to pathetic teenage morals and self-righteousness. But I think it's the misrepresentation of philosophy that make it so infuriating. The idea that at the end of the course the so-called top student still isn't able to disengage her own moral code long enough to join in the thought experiment. What have they been doing all year, if this is the first time that her sense of moral right and wrong is being challenged? Also, philosophy is the exploration of ideas and thoughts. So, what kind of philosophy teacher starts marking down his students because they show thoughts and opinions that differ from his own? He should be encouraging independent thought. Then, in the final act the right shows his true disregard for philosophy when logic is utterly shut down by emotional arguments. I assume this is just to make an appeal to the over emotional teens this movie is aimed at. Serves me right for watching this rubbish, I suppose.",negative
After the Dark,"I have never given a movie such a high score before; before you think I'm crazy, let me defend myself. I completely disagree with almost all the other reviews of the film here, good and bad. The issue is that many of the viewers have been focusing on the foreground that they miss the bigger message which steadily builds in the background. This movie is not about the literal philosophical problem of who to take in a bunker, it is about power structures and authority. The philosophical dilemma in this movie is more about Plato's Cave, to which it even gives a small shout-out. Ironically, the other reviewers who thought this was about an apocalypse are those watching shapes on the wall while the real 'philosophers' turned around and looked at the man casting the shadows. And he was indeed no philosopher king. Nope, he was just an isolated expat attempting to control his rather human and difficult situation.It is very rarely that a movie is so deep it actually fools almost all of its viewers. Which is why I think it has something for everyone. Even if you are only capable of watching shapes on the walls, at least they are entertaining shapes at that.",positive
Flight 7500,"I usually like movies in plane but with a good story. This movie has only a plane and no story at all. Even plane is cheap CGI. All what had to be scary stuff is stupid screams, blue pale hands. Maybe this was scary 15 years ago but now is almost 2015. We saw crap like this many times before. There are some known actors (not mega actors but still known) in this movie where I think why the hell they went for this movie. Acting also is unbelievable. There is no explanation to this movie. It ends just as stupid as it started. Scream and credits here we come. Some reviewers here say it is entertaining. If this is entertaining than what is boring for those people? Really! Once again - Do not waste your time and money. Save yourself from this cheap film.",negative
Flight 7500,If you are one of those people who think the horror movie is supposed to be a long screaming run in the woods with a knife equipped maniac on your back then let it pass. This is no cheap thrill jump fest and you might be bored.If you think the true horror builds on suspense and should bring you an unexpected twist at the end you will love this. This is really deep Japanese style horror movie that will left you stunned in the end. The movie systematically builds the suspension using a lot of different false twists.Really recommended!,positive
Occupation,"This had so much potential, big name actors (for Australia), clearly a significant budget but wow what a disaster it was. Bad direction, bad acting, poor continuity.
Was really hoping this would be quality as a proud Australian but this movie has set the local industry back years. 
Such a shame",negative
Occupation,"How this has gotten enough positive reviews to get a 6 rating is beyond me. I don't normally bother to do something like write a review and definitely not a bad one, but this warranted it.It is like they transplanted a Australian 1980's B-movie director to the present day and he tried to condense the TV-series Falling Skies(which is a half-way decent series) into a movie using every cliche imaginable with a sprinkling of Red Dawn on top.If I were to sum it up it is like what could have been a good story was re-told by an over 12 year old boy, skipping ahead when there should have been detail and spending a lot of time elaborating poorly on action scenes.Could have been a good movie and the story is actually not that bad but the way this is made is just.. bad.",positive
Clown,"Even if you aren't bothered by clowns, you have to admit that a killer clown is a pretty creepy idea. I mean clowns are always around children, they have a pale face, goofy hair and bright welcoming colors, masking the homicidal tendencies underneath. I always thought it would make a good movie idea, and Clown is about the closest we get to that. It's less of a killer clown story as much as it is a possession movie. This particular clown suit does not come off. If someone puts it on, it fuses with their skin while the demon slowly possesses them. The demon is a cannibal and only eats children. 5 children to be exact: one for every month of winter, or so the lore goes. It's an interesting take on the killer clown notion and I usually like Eli Roth so I was excited to see this movie. Unfortunately, Clown misses the mark in almost every way.It's an Eli Roth movie so of course there's lots of blood and gore, which is fine. Eating kids is also inherently disturbing, even though the killing is not shown on screen you do see a lot of children's guts, blood and body parts. The thing is, it doesn't really add anything to the movie. That's mainly because the movie doesn't build up much tension in the first place. It's slow to start - the dad is the one who puts on the costume to surprise his kid at his birthday party, but he falls asleep in it and when he wakes up, he finds that the wig infused with his hair and the costume is indestructible. The psychological aspect of this is interesting for a while, but it never goes the extra mile. Everything we see here has been done to death already. Just because the premise is cool doesn't mean cheesy dialogue and inappropriate jump scares get a free pass. They're still annoying as hell, and sadly they are littered throughout the entire movie.This movie has every horror cliché in the book. The jump scares in particular really detract from the movie's atmosphere. It sets a dark tone at the beginning, and even more so when the psychological elements start dripping in and the dad questions his sanity as he discovers more about the suit, but every once in a while someone will pop up behind someone else and the music will be LOUD for a second as if it's supposed to scare us. No, it doesn't work like that. All the good build up in the first two acts are dampened by these cheap scares - they give no time for tension to build before throwing another one at you, and it's just annoying after the first couple of times. The dialogue doesn't help either. Neither does the acting. Peter Stormare is great as usual but he doesn't get that much screen time. It's mainly the female lead and her reactions to her husband turning into this monster, and let me tell you, she is a terrible actress. There are also a lot of kids in this movie and kid actors are almost always terrible. You just don't care about any people on screen, except for the guy being possessed but even he is only in the first half of the movie. We're just stuck following a bland wife and her bland kid trying to stop the evil clown from killing other bland kids.The clown itself does not disappoint. It does look genuinely creepy, and the costume and make-up are very well done, but sadly that doesn't make up for a bad script and poor direction. It just has no style. It's really by-the-numbers horror with an Eli Roth tinge. The worst part is, it isn't even scary. If you're a fan of Eli Roth then you might get some enjoyment from this, but if you aren't a horror fanatic then don't bother.",negative
Clown,"No Spoiler alerts here! This movie was a good horror movie and playing on a character that a lot of people have phobias about makes it that much better. At the start, I was honestly feeling a cheesy, B movie type with a possible special appearance by the Dwight Johnson or Dolph Lundren :) The gore in the movie was top shelf and watching it with my wife and daughter (who are both scared of clowns) made it that much better and they absolutely loved it! And my daughter still slept in her own bed. I honestly don't know if there has been a horror movie with the main character of a clown that has been this good in the last 5-10 years, if I'm wrong please let me know of such movie. It was awesome how the story jumped feet first into the plot. Would love to see a prequel if it's done right .....Loved the gore!",positive
Upstream Color,"It's hilarious reading some of the comments for this movie, people give it ten stars but at the same time (if you read their comments) you can see they haven't got any more of an idea what the film is about than those who said it was rubbish and gave it just two. It seems then that some like to lie their way into making you believe they understood something you didn't. Pretentious? Most definitely. The film is just a collection of random scenes then. And you will find your brain struggling to find something that connects them all. A few times I thought I might be getting there, but just when you think the door of perception is opening.... Slam, it shuts in your face again. The film begins with a guy collecting maggots from the base of a plant, and scraping off some blue powder from it's leaves. The collected maggot(s) are then fed to a woman who's left a club and the effect is she's hypnotized into withdrawing sums of money collected from the equity on her house. Once out of her trance she tries to remove her inner maggots (which now seem to have magically changed species into tapeworms) and are seen crawling under her skin. She gets a knife and tries half-heartedly to cut them out to no avail. She then goes to some pig farmer who appears to remove them but afterwards shes not the same person she was before, becoming vacant and kind of disturbed and depressed.Later on, we see her on a train where she meets some other weird soul and they strike up a relationship. From here it all gets a bit wishy washy with apparently pointless dialogue and no real direct thread of a story. At one point the girl thinks she's pregnant and goes to a hospital where they tell her shes been operated on at some stage, even though she herself disagrees (a reference to the pig farmers removal of her maggot/tapeworms), but then she's told shes had cancer but it's all gone now. Later there are scenes of some people collecting blue flowers growing near a river where the farmer from earlier had been throwing piglets in a sack to their death. We are shown the dead piglets rotting in the river, and the ooze that comes out seems to rise up through the roots of riverside plants being fed on by maggots. Was this a connection then? Dead pig juice being picked up by maggots in plants which were given to the woman which hypnotized her? Your guess is as good as mine. Eventually the couple are lead via sounds (the pig farmer liked to record sounds on some equipment he had) to the farmer where the woman shoots him and a bunch of other people turn up (which we are shown on what looks like some medical kind of records) and they take over his farm. There's a cut then to the flower collectors from earlier who can no longer find the blue flowers they wanted (only white) which seemed to indicate that whatever was making these blue flowers is now gone (no more dead pigs in the river maybe?). And that's about it. Basically, the film is pig swill. It looks great, cinematically, and I think I've probably put up the best explanation yet here of what the film is actually ""about"" - even though that seems to be nothing at all. I think it was Alfred Hitchcock who said something like: An audience not understanding, is an audience not emoting - and that's exactly what happens in this pile of pig poo. My advice then is don't waste your time on it, or if you do, don't pretend you got it. I don't believe you.",negative
Upstream Color,"I knew this film was going to be weird. Shane Carruth's debut film - Primer - was an oddity as it was, lacking in straightforward answers or explanations, but presenting a very intriguing and sturdy piece of hard science fiction. Be warned that Upstream Color is also something that lacks a straightforward explanation. In fact, Primer was something rather cold, with its strong basis in the scientific method; UC is far warmer and artistic, but is also more abstract.The film may come off as slow and dull to certain viewers, especially if you're expecting a strong narrative structure or plot. I'm usually adverse to movies that have no real plot or conflict, but with this film, it's the experience that matters. Watching this film is a strangely mesmerizing, lucid, and smooth experience, given the exquisite imagery, nuanced performances, and quality music score. The film's first fifteen minutes are probably the most straightforward, most interesting, and most disturbing aspect of the whole thing, and it serves as an important fulcrum point. This much I understand: the film starts off with the freaky notion that there's a man injecting grubs into people, which makes them susceptible to mind control. From then on, the film tracks two such victims who inevitably come together and discover the secrets of their latent trauma.What makes the film so weird, so cerebral, and potentially frustrating, is that things happen, and characters will say things that won't make total sense. And most scenes are intercut with such footage as a farmer tending to pigs, and flowers growing in the wilderness. The movie draws stark parallels between such images, to unearth some rich thematic territory. Could such scenes reflect on life and death? Is it all about nature? Is it about love? Is it the human condition overall? The film never really tell you outright, and it gets very surreal when scenes overlap. If you struggle to find logic behind this story, you might write it off as messy. If you take in the experience and open your mind to interpreting the film, it'll keep your brain going and haunt you indefinitely. It's an experience comparable to such films as Mulholland Drive.This film is very stylish, with some beautiful photography and ingenious editing. All actors put on decent performances, and they show a good blend of nuance and emotion. Writing is pretty weird, given the amount of strange and unusual dialogue. This production uses excellent sets, props, and costumes. The music score is very exquisite.While Primer was a film that appeals on an intellectual level, Upstream Color appeals best to the artistic side of the brain. If you're susceptible to strange, abstract films that require lots of brainpower to interpret and understand, then this one is a perfect puzzlebox for you. Casual audiences might want to approach this with caution.5/5 (Experience: Very Good | Content: Very Good | Film: Perfect)",positive
Time Lapse,"On the first page of the IMDb reviews, people are showering it with praise with bullshit such as it being ""intelligent, smart and coherent"" which makes me wonder if they even know what these terms mean.First of all directing your ""future"" self to do things so that a camera today can reap the fruits of your label seems a bit too paradoxical, but okay fine, I will accept it, I'm open-minded enough.But then everything just goes from retarded to worse. Why would you need a crooked bookmaker to place your bets to begin with? It's not like that would be the only way to make tons of money.How can the painter not have inspiration, but his future self does? It makes no sense, but whatever, I'll again open my mind and accept it.And after what's-his-name kills the bookmaker and his goon, that girl acts completely ridiculous towards her boyfriend, I really despise lack of logic or just general stupidity.Then in the end ""what's-his-name"" learned from ""what's-her-name"" that altering the time-line doesn't incur death. You think? Really? Like maybe use the frigging internet to look up theories on alternate or parallel time-lines before you start acting like a retard and lock your supposed friend up in the basement.Supposed friend breaks free and manages to bluff ""what's-his-name"" into handing over his gun to the girl. Later on he manages to turn the tables around again and hits the gun out of his hands and never bothers to look behind him that hey maybe the girl heard their struggle and might be looking for a way to take matters into her own hand.And that right there was the point I just thought, quit it, this movie strives on stupidity. I should have turned it off earlier, but hey I had nothing else to do.I don't care for the low budget concept. The only thing low budget is the lacking amount of logic in this movie. Ugh.",negative
Time Lapse,"In some senses Time Lapse is a movie about time travel and all the paradoxes that would come in tow, but really that is just the stage that is used for a movie that explores many aspects of human nature. Time Lapse gives its characters a tool that can fulfill all their desires, and then shows the addiction, greed, manipulation, and general moral decay that follows.Bradley King and BP Cooper did a stellar job with the writing. They waste no time in setting up the plot, immediately put you on the edge of your seat, and keep you there until the credits roll. All the actors turned in excellent performances despite the challenge of their characters being designed to remind you of the parts of yourself that you try to deny. This is not a story of heroes doing heroic things; it is a story of your awkward twenty-something self trying to find the guts to do the right thing. The cinematography is particularly incredible. The movie is confined to a single modest apartment complex, and yet somehow it is chillingly beautiful. I never thought a man looking at a bunch of Polaroids pinned to a wall would be the recipe for a spectacular shot, but somehow it is. I haven't seen a movie with this kind of creepy and eerie beauty since Jean- Pierre Jeunet's early films.Time lapse is the directorial debut for Bradley King, and yet you would never know it by watching the movie. If he can pull something like this off on his first try at a feature film, I cannot wait to see what comes next.",positive
Cooties,"I can honestly say I hated 'Cooties'' within the first five minutes.When you make a horror/comedy, and the comedy falls flat on every level, you're in for a very long 90 minutes. I can imagine people walking out of this one around the 15 minute mark, because that's when my limit of stupidity had reach it's maximum capacity. There just isn't enough horror to make up for the rest of the film. The acting is some of the worst I've seen all year. Maybe the worst. Alison Pill and Jack McBrayer are worthy of a Razzie nomination, at the very least. They give hands down the worst performances you're going to see in any film this year. Elijah Wood is terribly miscast, as he's inserted into a role that would be best played by Adam Sandler. That's right, Elijah Wood, you get a pass on this one. Words cannot describe how bad the dialogue is, so I won't even try. You'll just have to experience it for yourself. My apologies.The best way to describe this awful film, is that it's something you'd expect from Adam Sandler - and I'm curious how and why he missed the boat here. Maybe he was busy with 'Pixels?' I am just baffled how a film this bad can get any type of positive feedback, as it is complete and utter trash. Do yourself a favor and check out 'Bloodsucking Bastards' instead. Random Ramblings of a Madman: Out of all my reviews, this is the only review where I'm curious to see how many down votes I receive. Because it tells me that somewhere out there is a person or persons who actually enjoyed 'Cooties.' And that will be funnier than anything I experienced in the film itself. Thank you.",negative
Cooties,"Clint (Elijah Wood) goes to his old school, Fort Chicken elementary school, Illinois (GO FIGHTING ROOSTERS!) as a substitute teacher.

The film introduces us to a number of quirky characters and kids that are not that adorable. Due to a viral breakout caused by processed chicken nuggets (I tossed mine out after seeing how nuggets are made from pink paste) the children turn into blood thirsty zombies who attack in hordes with some limited mental capacities.The film spoofs formula writing: dress up montage; guy who is way too smart; self-sacrifice individual; climbing through the vent duct; and a reference to a previous film...""Sneak around like a little Hobbit.""This is a funny zombie style cult film.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",positive
Anna,"Again: Many spoilers ahead.At first, I kind of liked this movie - the two lead characters are well played, and so is their relationship as it develops through the meandering memories and the developments in the supposedly real world. It's adequately somber. The twists towards the end were a bit obvious in my opinion - of course she was luring him to the house and setting him up, and of course these were his memories, with the distant guy watching in precisely the way the main character explains at the beginning.Unfortunately, once you start to think about the plot, it falls apart.He's a detective, yet he doesn't really look at any of the clues he has taken home (e.g., the yearbook) in any depth until after the case is practically closed. Nice evidence board decoration he had on the wall - he should have perhaps drawn one up for this case too. And when called, he does this oh so old stupid movie mistake of rushing in without telling anybody. When will movie writers finally stop using that?Her side is even worse. There were signs of her interacting with the outside world, e.g., her drawing of stairs where he believes to have seen her. Was she able to occasionally escape? Apart from that, nothing of her whole back-story was explained; did she or did she not commit any crimes? Had she just been at the wrong place in the wrong time? How much was fabricated by her, how much was honest? What was with that ""Mousey"" confusion? Who was lying about what now? And finally: If she wanted to be assumed dead to get away from her parents, didn't sending the picture refute that purpose entirely? What is she living on now anyway? If running away was all she wanted, she evidently didn't need this convoluted plan to do so. When our main guy arrived at the house, the doors were already wide open.I guess you can explain some of those aspects away with ""those were just his memories of her memories"", but frankly, I think that's just an excuse for a script which was too obsessed with its twists.",negative
Anna,"John Washington is a memory detective - he is able to access memories in order to solve crimes. Traumatised by the death of his wife and baby son, he is given an ""easy"" case - assisting Anna, the daughter of wealthy parents, who is refusing to eat. But the case proves to be far less straightforward than anticipated: is he being manipulated by a sociopath? Mark Strong is Washington and Taissa Farmiga (Vera's younger sister) is Anna in a strongly acted thriller with mildly supernatural overtones, which keeps you guessing all the way through. There is relatively little action or violence, but that doesn't really matter- this is primarily a thoughtful piece, and a mildly unusual one.",positive
The Colony,"By the looks of the trailers, I actually had a slight hope for this flick. I'm a sucker for survival-movies and it starred Fishbourne and Paxton, cool right? No! This movie had everything going for it, but they managed to ruin it.First of all, how did Fishbourne and Paxton do? They did alright, it's just that their characters are horrible clichés. Fishbourne is obviously the wise, great leader everybody loves and Paxton is his counter-part. A trigger-happy redneck who wants to have a tighter regime among the survivors, this character could be exciting, but with no development nor a lot of screen-time, he becomes too boring..Speaking of survivors, I forgot to mention the 'Day after tomorrow'-plot here. We get to know that it just started snowing, that's why the entire globe has entered a new ice age, well okay, now I feel wiser. The plot is also told though the narration of the protagonist Sam, who looks a lot like Emile Hirsch, just more wooden. After receiving a distress call from another group of survivors, Fishbourne, Sam and some random dead- beat who brings pornography on expeditions (Fishbourne even asks if he wants to be alone when he pulls the magazine out, I'm not kidding)goes to investigate. After they find a skinnier version of Sharlto Copley, we meet the bad guys, who are basically a bunch of exaggerated orcs. The movie also tries to create some minor sub-plots, but fails. The tedious nightmare with flashbacks from Sam's childhood doesn't add anything to the story, and is explained by Fishbourne after 30 minutes, there goes the potential mystery. I must admit this film is on the verge of becoming a B-movie. The effects are horrendous, the camera gets a seizure during the fight- scenes and the ending was predicted during the first five minutes. It's sad to see such great actors get involved in garbage such as this now a days.",negative
The Colony,"If you have an affinity for movies like The Warriors, Mad Max, Carpenter's The Thing, Craven's The Hills Have Eyes, you will be game for this fun b-movie. Imaginative and well-paced. Don't expect a 100 million dollar special-effects extravaganza with every little detail and character fleshed out to the extreme. That's not what these type of movies are for. The Colony is an economically told, well written, nicely shot, low-budget affair with engaging performances from all. You'll be surprised and impressed with how much the filmmakers accomplished with less than 20 million dollars. The authenticity of the underground colony is great (it doesn't feel like a film set) considering they filmed at the decommissioned NORAD facility in Northern Ontario.",positive
Le chant du loup,"Although François Civil and Reda Kateb partially save the day, this film transpires mediocrity and cheapness with a hardly-credible scenario.

Le chant du loup,"As far as I know, there has never been any French movie speaking of submarines. And if there is one in the future, it will never be as excellent as this one. Impossible. This one is the first and will remain the best, whatever other features may bring. It's proudly in the line of HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER or James B Harris BEDFORD INCIDENT, starring Richard Widmark and Sidney Poitier, with also a bit of Sid Lumet's FAILSAFE. Great acting, editing, directing, with tons of details and accuracy in every domain of submarines.

The Double,"This is a seriously weird and disturbing movie that initially looks like it's going to come across as a bit of a 21st Century downmarket version of Brazil. Our hero experiences a sequence of unsettling events, seemingly unconnected and apparently trivial to a degree, although clearly aiming to tee up some of the later action.The lighting, the sounds, the camera shots are all wonderfully done, setting a disturbing and unsettling atmosphere that gently but with increasing urgency begins to throw a blanket of latent claustrophobia across characters and happenings. We witness curious incidents and are left to guess their significance, our hero reaches out to the girl but is beaten to the jump by....who exactly? How much of what we see actually takes place is questionable. How much some of the latter scenes make sense even more so. Yet, as it twists and turns towards the denouement, I found myself gripped and engaged to an uncommon degree. It is a difficult movie as it winds up, no question, but I find the notion that anyone feeling suicidal needs warning before viewing as slightly hysterical.On the one hand, this is an easy film to describe, whether you reference the source material, or your talk about the doppleganger and what it might be like to find one has a double. Yet on the other hand, it's almost impossible to sum this up after one viewing, as there felt like there are so many little bits and pieces that suddenly reveal themselves to your eyes and ears. that you're forced to think about going back to sit back through it again. The question is, which one of you will go...?",negative
The Double,"It's an artsy-psychological tale with sparse dialog and lots of confused hints of an actual plot. The unsatisfying surprise-ending seemed like a lame attempt to explain all of the ""tangled web"". I felt no empathy for the disturbed main character.

The Rover,"Excellent acting and marvelous photography are wasted on a script that has no focus and a musical score that suggests aboriginal influences which are not otherwise present. Literally every actor in this film delivers excellent performances, even the people with minor parts.As a post-apocalyptic film, the script offers very little new, and there are many inconsistencies that may be attributed to the Australian location. But this is no ""Mad Max"", and that's a shame.One of the core problems of the film is that there isn't anyone to root for, apart from a few transitory characters. The main characters are bad, very bad, and pathetic.Another problem with the film is the long ECUs. Generally speaking, long ECUs can serve a useful purpose, as they do in Leone's films. But less is more, and in this case, more is less.",negative
The Rover,"Just like the mud and the dust on the characters in the film, the excellent The Rover gets under the skin and remains there, long after the screen went black.The story takes place in the Australian outback in the near future after a collapse. A bitter loner sees his car stolen by a gang and tries to get it back at all cost with the help of the wounded, simple brother of a gang member, left behind after a disastrous robbery.Slow and intense The Rover sucks you into the desert, you can almost feel the heat and the flies in your face. Few words are used, more is said by gunshots. Here are no action heroes who at the end clean up the mess, restore the order and peace and let you leave theater with the feeling that you were nicely entertained. The people in The Rover are desperate to such extent that they've almost become indifferent towards life. They try to survive, period.The bizarre relationship between the angry loner Eric and the naive, dependent Rey is wonderfully brought on screen. Both Guy Pearce and Robert Pattinson deliver brilliant performances. Guy embodies perfectly the bitter,rude, inner wounded Eric with his body language and the intense gaze . Robert disappears into Rey, a damaged rather innocent soul who IMO has been taught to blindly obey and not to think for himself, in a way that will blow people away. The tics and blinks belong to Rey, you see them disappear when he feels more at ease, reappear in situations of stress. The supporting actors are amazing as well.Although the film is dark, the mood is not cold IMO. Under the surface of alienation and cruelty there's a palpable emotional layer of vulnerability and fear. Michôd created a world frighteningly realistic and raw, a world we, civilized people, in fact don't want to face. With his second movie David shows again how incredibly talented he is. I was eagerly anticipating The Rover and it met all my expectations. The performances alone is pure enjoyment together with the beautiful landscapes and the amazing music score. Some scenes are quite funny like Rey trying to do his best to be a good partner, or when he's singing.There's also a lot to think about after watching The Rover. What collapse can cause such situation? How far are civilized people willing to go when there's nothing left to loose? Is Rey mentally disabled or is he the product of a very unfavorable education?And why did I think about Animal Kingdom after The Rover had finished? See the movie and you'll know.

You either had something to do with the production of this film or have never been allowed out of the basement. It was the most boring pointless film I have seen in years and there are some pretty bad movies out there. It wasn't artistic or clever and pretty much absolutely nothing happens. Save yourself 2 hours and come help me paint instead.",negative
Thelma,"Lights flicker, the wind rises and animals behave strangely when Thelma becomes agitated. She is capable of mysterious and ethereal powers, and more than she knows because her manipulative and fundamentalist parents keep such things under wraps in home-school. As Thelma heads to college in Oslo and stops taking medications, not only do her parents lose control, she loses control of herself. Psychogenic seizures rack her body. Passions and anxieties multiply along with her abilities. This is when Anja, Thelma's close friend, does something extremely upsetting for Thelma. The next day when Anja can't be found, Thelma has a sickening feeling she had something to do with it. She searches for answers to the secrets and powers that beguile and haunt her.This thrilling, deep, complex and sensual film explores a whole realm of different theories and possibilities. I was surprised and delighted by its twists and turns. It crosses borders between reality and fantasy, and light and darkness, and explores the good and bad in human nature. The actors are amazing, especially Eili Harboe as Thelma and Kaya Wilkins as Anja. It is fantastic to discover that the roots of psychogenic disorders go back as far as Joan of Arc. Seen at the Toronto International Film Festival.",positive
Cold Skin,"Short opening preview:COLD SKIN opens with scenes of a young man, whose name is Friend, on the deck of a tramp steamer bound, as we are to learn, for a remote island where he is to perform duties as a weather observer for a term of 12 months. The aged and worn Capt. of the clanking old vessel, Capt. Axel, chats with Friend on the deck with surprising kindness. Colorfully, Friend observes that the captain treats him with the felicitousness of the executioner for the condemned.Almost immediately, we arrive at Friend's island destination, an intensely desolate place with almost no vegetation, all volcanic rocks with a little sand. Incongruously perched like a wart on an otherwise featureless face, the small cabin Friend is to call home for the next 12 months squats not far from the shore, surrounded by the few constructs necessary to support Friend's weather observation activities. A few sailors carry Friend's meager belongings into the cabin which appears in a bit more disarray than one would expect. Friend is supposed to replace the existing weather observer, but the present occupant of the cabin is nowhere to be found.Capt. Axel sends the sailors away and then he and Friend go to a lighthouse some distance away in hopes of questioning the lighthouse operator as to the whereabouts of the existing weather observer. Upon arriving at the lighthouse, we see a most unusual structure. The lighthouse and its immediate surrounds are bristling with sharp sticks and festooned with other such unwelcoming accoutrement at every possible point of attachment. No one answers the door even after much yelling and pounding at the door.Breaking in, Friend and Capt. Axel discover the lighthouse operator upstairs, passed out naked, apparently from too much drink. Friend and Capt. Axel rouse the lighthouse operator who gives every indication of being exceptionally hostile and unstable. As for the missing weather observer, the only explanation they get from the lighthouse operator, who we learn is named Gruner, are some vague mumblings about his having died from disease.Friend and Capt. Axel return to Friend's own cabin where Capt. Axel attempts to dissuade Friend from remaining in this awful place just one final time. Friend refuses and the pair bid each other a pleasant farewell.That very night, Friend hears someone or something moving about immediately outside his cabin. He tentatively calls out to who he assumes is Gruner, but there is no answer. Startlingly, a dark, gray-green webbed hand reaches probingly beneath the cabin door. Understandably horrified, Friend immediately and enthusiastically stabs it with a knife. And so Friend's nightmare begins.Review:From the very first scene, COLD SKIN immediately impresses with its production values. The music is excellent and atmospheric, the cinematography is engaging and colorful with an almost Jules Vern-esque adventure feel, and the actors are colorful and well played. The special-effects/CGI are first-rate. The island setting is superbly appropriate for the subject matter and is so desolate it feels frightening just sitting there, doing nothing. So, for most aspects of its production, COLD SKIN gets a solid 10/10.Unfortunately, and in my opinion most disappointingly, the entire thing falls flat due to a storyline that is utter unmitigated, illogical rubbish. The movie wishes to pile-drive us in the face with a morality tale about xenophobia, apparently, and is willing to corrupt its own storyline to the point of utter nonsense in order to do it. The net effect is a storyline that, if you think about it for more than 5 seconds, makes absolutely no sense.Why are the fish-people willing to mindlessly throw themselves in mass attacks against the lighthouse night after night only to be killed by the score? What are they after? The land is not their domain of interest and even if it was there are no resources there as it is utterly barren. If it's the fish-girl that's keeping company with Gruner that's attracting them, what's so special about her? If the fish-girl is causing the attacks, does she not care that her brethren are being killed by the busload every night? Why do the fish-people only attack at night when it's abundantly clear they're perfectly happy to be out in the daylight? Why does Gruner say they fear the light when they obviously don't? Why does the fish-girl want to keep company with humans who treat her like garbage? She's not being held prisoner in any way and has access to the water whenever she wants. Why does Gruner, who has been working diligently to massacre them by the hundreds for the entire picture, suddenly walk out the door at the end and allow himself to be torn to pieces? I only stop here arbitrarily; this list could go on indefinitely.Movies can be highly stylized to the point of apparent insanity (BRAZIL, THE 9TH CONFIGURATION, etc.) and still have perfectly functional stories with which to tell their morality tales without fundamentally trashing the basic mechanisms and properties of decent storytelling. In a movie, even apparent insanity has to be carefully crafted and constructed, controlled and sculpted. It can't be shoveled out and thrown at the viewer like a monkey throwing poo at passersby at a zoo.And, sadly, in its zeal to hit us over the head with its moral, that's pretty much what COLD SKIN is like.Update 2/21/2018: Some have suggested to me that a reading of the original book from which COLD SKIN is derived might clarify my many irritations with respect to the story. This is a wholly unsuitable suggestion for numerous reasons, though I will only name a few. Firstly, barring exigent circumstances, a movie should stand on its own and should not rely on information ""not in evidence"". There are certain situations, such as the Star Wars franchise, where there are so many stories and sub-stories that make up the overall arc that are revealed in so many different kinds of media (animation, books, audio recordings, etc.) that one is obviously expected to explore these other elements to obtain the full sense of the franchise. COLD SKIN is not one of those circumstances. It is simply a poor story poorly expressed. If one MUST read the book to understand the movie, why see the movie?I suffered enough with the movie and so, truthfully, I have not read the book. A friend of mine, however, has. I put some of the collection of questions I have regarding the overall story to my friend and she was not any more able to answer them than I was with the movie with the single exception of the question as to why the Sitauca (the formal name of the fish/frog/whatever people) incessantly attack the weatherman and the lighthouse keeper; it was for the warm meat. This of course makes obvious sense; innumerable hundreds of at least semi-sentient beings would obviously be willing to sacrifice themselves for only 2 food kills at best. Uh-Huh.In short, the book form of COLD SKIN adds more, and I am told repetitive, detail but little if any more clarity. The story is a self-indulgence of an author that is primarily an anthropologist possessed of Deep Meanings he wishes to express. There are some 7.6 billion people in the world and it is inevitable that there will be a few who share the author's peculiar brand of moral navel contemplation; others will be less impressed. Reading the book illuminates issues only for the predisposed.",negative
Cold Skin,"This film will not be for everyone (hence the disappointing low rating). For starters, it's almost an exact adaptation from the Spanish (Barcelona, Spain) award wining debut novel (translated to 37 languages) by Albert Sánchez Piñol, and directed almost perfectly by Frenchman Xavier Gens. It is not your typical big-screen huge budget Hollywood action blockbuster with A-list actors, and thus should not be compared (as other reviews have) to The Shape of Water. Instead, it's an artistic piece shot extremely well that was written by a Spaniard and presented by a Frenchman - definitely no Hollywood here.The directing, cinematography, landscape, vfx/sfx and score where outstanding - near perfect. The actors (never heard of either) performed exceptionally well and were very convincing. Yes, there were some avoidable obvious plot issues, which was disappointing considering how great the rest of the production was. However I'm thinking that it was an editing issue and cutting scenes to get the length down to 108 mins, of which considering the slow pace, I'd be complaining on the length, yet it didn't feel that long. It could also be a screenplay adaptation issue from the two novice writers - they did squeeze in as much as they could from the novel, but maybe should have cut certain scenes shorter to fill in the blanks.I've read some reviewers had questions about certain things that happened. Some of those issue are answered if you stop and think why this happened and/or dig a little deeper into the meaning. Others, you will need to read the book. I did, and have nothing to question, but do understand how others who didn't read the book would have questions.A very impressive film, unlike any other I have seen, and needs to be appreciated for what it is, and how is was shown. Would I recommend it or see it again? Absolutely. Had better screenwriters adapted the novel, this would have been a perfect 10/10. But still is a well deserved 8.5 rounded up to a 9/10 from me.",positive
Europa Report,"Any decent sci-fi film combines good science, writing, direction, visuals, and acting. This movie had none of that.The science in this film was absurd and implausible; the first manned mission after the Moon is Europa, not Mars. Why Europa? Nobody knows. And most presumably no probes or robots were sent to Europa in advance. Everything that was portrayed by astronauts in the film has already been done by current, actual robots in Mars; so why the need to send people to Europa? It looks so weak as a PR move by a corporation. The whole Hydrazine premise is so ridiculous. There was absolutely no justification for so many space walks in such weak suits: fixing batteries and fuses, correcting icing problems in fuel lines... When the time comes for a real-life manned mission to get beyond the Asteroid Belt, you bet that mission will have thousands of safeguards and protection against common things that happen in space like radiation, solar storms, asteroids, battery failures, and icing. The writers probably ignored such basic planning for the sake of dramatic effect, as if a corporation would risk lives with sloppy mission design in this kind of PR move. The only possible exception for this scientific mess is the artificial gravity, which is produced by the fool-proof rotating module that we have seen in other films, and even then who cares? They got the Jupiter-Europa gravity all wrong.The writing was terrible: the retrospective to the launch events was absolutely unnecessary. Precious time that would have been best invested in character development. Nobody cares about your characters, their intentions, motivation, relationships, deaths, nothing. They enunciate their motives for giving up their lives, but you can be sure they don't feel like saving the day; they might as well let the mission fail. Real-world astronaut training is not Kamikaze training. Real-world astronauts are naturally afraid to die, just as everyone else; in such vein they are trained not to attempt stupid stunts like going after the light or walking without tethers. The writing is so poor that you could switch the characters in their roles, you could change the whole premise to an expedition to the Arctic, like The Thing, or something like The Abyss with little change. No tension, no climax, no suspense.The whole documentary format was also unnecessary; it had no purpose; it doesn't even look as a direction or art device; I am pretty sure it happened at the editing room: they first tried the basic sequential cut, and then they tried to rearrange the scenes without adding or removing anything, and found it more interesting; anyways the film makes the same sense: none.There is a reason I don't spend two hours of my time watching security footage: because it's boring. But then there I am, watching security footage of a bunch of people I couldn't care less about doing some implausible things for the sake of dramatic effect. Gratuitous close-ups of nostrils and teeth. I feel ripped off. I think every take on Jupiter, Europa, and the creature were also represented from the point of view of the fixed cameras, so the visuals there are super-boring. The creature had more tentacles than animation frames in this film. Terrible lighting. There are three exceptions to this visual nonsense: the solar storm is pretty good, the ship sets are decent, and the theatrical release poster looks way better than the film's Europa footage. Unimpressive film.Finally, the acting; I'd really like to say that the good actors had poor material to work with, and that their talents were wasted. But I strongly believe they were so bored with the premise and script that they didn't even care about their performances. Killing Copley off so early was a terrible move, but who cares anyway? Keeping him to the end does not help things.This film is a fantastic example of how not to make sci-fi. Please take notes.",negative
Europa Report,"If you are a true sci-fi fan, you should see this movie. It doesn't have a lot of visual effects, star cast or action. What it does have is realism, scientific character and honest human emotions. It tells a simple story of astronauts doing their job, willing to make sacrifices for science and not being dramatic about it. The plot and characters are believable, and realistic style of the film creates suspense much better than any cheap effects and tricks. This movie is made in a true spirit of sci-fi genre. Perhaps, it doesn't deserve a 10, but it should definitely have a higher score than something like ""Prometheus"". After all let us not forget about 'science' in 'science fiction'.",positive
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I was skeptical of this movie, to say the least. As a huge fan of both animes and the original manga, I doubted that Fumihiko Sori and his crew could do Hiromu Arakawa's masterpiece any kind of justice.However, the end result is surprisingly okay. Sure, the CGI tends to be an eyesore, the acting is all over the place, and some characters aren't remotely similar to their badass manga/anime counterparts (here's lookin' at you, Riza). But on the whole, this film kind of works. The screenwriters made good choices in terms of what to adapt and how to fit it all together, and some characters (mainly Hughes, portrayed by Ryuta Sato) work really well.Most importantly, the film has heart. I get the feeling that Fumihiko Sori and c:o genuinely cared about the adaptation, and that ain't nothin'. It's an ambitious production, though arguably an overly ambitious one.FAR from a perfect adaptation, and nowhere near as good as the animes or manga, but it's not an insult to the original story, and not a bad way to spend two hours of your life.",negative
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I'm going to try to keep my review as simple as I can, but I have been a huge fan of the FMA manga/anime for years so that might be a little tough. Casting: 10/10 (I really could not imagine anyone else playing any of the characters.)Acting: 10/10 (Amazing. just great. The way they worked so hard and brought the characters to life was just beautiful)CGI: 9/10 (It's not that it was bad, but I liked some of the CG better than other parts. Like the fire and Al was my absolute favorite! And the way everyone interacts with the CG is amazing)Story Flow: 8/10 (I agree with most, there was a few parts that were a little slow/a little fast but overall it was a great story. I especially really enjoyed the 1st half and most of the 2nd)Costuming: 12/10 (don't even get me started. They did perfect my dudes. Ed's coat was epic and the blue uniform were just the best)Dialogue: 10/10 (The fact that most of the dialogue was word for word from the original content brought me to tears)Music: 9.5/10 (There is actually only one place that I noticed that I didn't like the music. Actually, it was that there was no music that bothered me, and it was only like 3 seconds long. Yeah maybe I'm being picky, but to me music is very important, and so I couldn't help but be pulled out of the flow a little in one scene. besides that, they were totally spot on)Accuracy to the Original: 9/10 (True, they don't stick to the timeline very well, but 90% of the content in the movie has happened at some point in the series, so I can't give them any less than 9/10)Over all I'm going to give it a 10/10. mainly because I have never seen an anime to live action adaptation do as absolute wonderful as they did with this movie. Now, there will be people who don't like it, and that's fine. It does have a specific taste and feel that not everyone will like. I will say, if you go into this movie expecting it to be a recreation of the original manga/anime then you will probably be a little disappointed. But if you go into it understanding that they had to create a story that fits into 2 hours, not knowing if there was going to be a 2nd movie, and understand that it is an adaptation not a recreation, then I think you will be pleasantly surprised!",positive
Hot Tub Time Machine 2,"The first Hot Tub movie was funny. Sometime you should leave well enough alone. The entire movie pushed the envelope of X rated junk. The D word; F word; men's private parts basically was the entire script. The actual movie was probably 30 minutes long. The rest was inane dialogue you find when there is no real material for a script The movie rambles on trying to find out who killed Lou. The script appears aimless as the four friends journey through wild parties;obsession with penis and any other debauchery the writer can come up with. This movie is truly a sequel let down. Cheap laughs will be had by teenagers and porn customers. If you do not fall into either category save your money and stay clear of this movie. It isn't even worth ""on demand""!!!!",negative
Hot Tub Time Machine 2,"So i got lost a bit in the beginning so i kinda had to watch bits and pieces from the first movie :\The plot is weak, didn't made an hint of impression ,in some parts felt all over the place, no where near the fresh new idea as the first movie, making the traveling this time to the future was a clever touch trying to save the sequel,, And to be fair the comedy worked in some other parts. The storyline was okay, and the screenplay looked tidier and tighter after the first 40 minutes.As for the cast, they were engaging ,, i mean after 2010 the cast drifted apart to their own stuff, Rob Corddry spent a quality time on TV with his ""Children's Hospital"" show ,, Craig Robinson on ""The office"" and ""the Cleveland show"" and same goes for Clark Duke ,, so coming back here after a 5 years gap looked somehow not that WoWzer moment but it went fine in the end.Overall,, even though the plot was weak, the writers and the dorky oddly funny scenes of the three guys plus Adam Scott did a good job saving some dignity for the movie ... i'm sure it wasn't so satisfying for the ""hot tub time machine"" loyal Fans ,, but if i'd like to keep it brightly optimistic i'd say 4 out 10 seems quite fair for the sequel.",positive
Shin Godzilla,"The movie was a great satire on the Japanese Government during the time of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. The reactions by the Prime Minister, defense minister, etc etc during Godzilla's initial appearance perfectly recreate the indecision that lead to more people being killed in that country than necessary during the real life disaster. In short, this movie uses Godzilla to satirize the Japanese government. A new, more decisive body of government forms in the aftermath and one end of it wants to evacuate Tokyo to Nuke him and the other wants to make a more experimental approach by analyzing Godzilla's body chemistry (the science is actually pretty good and leads to a surprisingly tense climax that involves construction cranes pumping hoses down Godzillas throat). The scenes with the humans are also shot in a very dynamic and fast paced way. Characterization suffers (Japanese films do this thing where they just add an odd quirk to a characters personality and call it a day) but its all for the purpose on finding out how to take care of the giant monster rampaging through the city while minimizing human casualties. Believably too, like how the government would actually react would it have happened.As for the big guy himself, Toho definitely plays around with him a lot. He's still a big green iconic monster, but they change his design more than I've ever seen before. When he first appears in the movie, he's more like a tadpole and over the film evolves into the monster we know. But even then he does things like opens his lower jaw when breathing fire like the predator, shooting beams from his dorsal fin and tail, and there's even a VERY chilling shot at the end involving Godzillas tail with some imagery with broader implications on what Godzilla is able to do. But for all these new things that happen, there's a bunch of stylistic choices that keep it rooted in its history. There's music being used from the original 50's score than ever before (they use more than just that classic brass theme), Godzilla still has his trademark roar, and when he breathes fire in a way we've never seen before (it starts as gas, lights up into a jetstream of flame, and then concentrates into a beam) there's a classic sound effect played that we haven't heard in ages. In short, there's a bunch of new and classic stylistic choices in equal measure. Plus the scene where he destroys Tokyo is, in a weird way, gorgeous to look at.In short, this is the smartest giant monster movie I've ever seen. It's not for everybody but it's certainly for people who understand what that means.",negative
Shin Godzilla,"The film takes a somber, serious tone as to what would happen if Japan were attacked -- in this case, by a seemingly unstoppable foe. At present in Japan, there is an ongoing debate as to whether or not Japan should amend it's constitution to allow for an offensive military and this Godzilla film plays to exactly how powerless Japan would be in making it's own decisions during an attack of any kind. The reality is that the Japanese Prime Minister would have to ask for permission from the United States President before making an offensive move against a foreign threat and this film plays to that hard reality. This new Godzilla starts out as an homage to its former man in a monster suit so that when you first see Godzilla, you'll disbelieve what you're seeing, but this Godzilla evolves into something majestic and utterly awe inspiring in its power. What's more, this film makes it clear people die. In the Japanese release there's a lot of word play about how the government officials up high (on the fifth floor) make decisions that get passed down to people on lower floors that eventually hurt the people. I'm not sure how much will be translated, but the film is deliberately showing the disconnect between the political and day to day realities. Overall, the performances are good. There is one character who they, for whatever reason, decided to make speak English in odd an inappropriate times. This isn't a film for US audiences. The aesthetics will turn off a lot of non-Japanese young people accustomed to CG reality. But if you're open to learning about another culture, this is an excellent film, one of the best kaiju-films you'll ever see.",positive
Little Monsters,"I did not enjoy this movie and this is why. First the buildup of the movie: 30 minutes intro main characters (jawn), 5 minutes cool army base (yeah), 10 minutes zombie chases (tame), 40 minutes locked up in a shop with a lot of singing. The movie contains to much little children to be an adult movie, but the jokes and swearing are to rude to be a children's movie, so what is this for movie? For adults far to childish, for kids to rude. Just don't expect to much humor or zombie action, but a lot of singing, just like that movie Frozen.",negative

I did not see it and think the rating for this will lower when it hits the international market.I did not like it.Do not recommend it.

Who Am I,"It is not very often that a German movie tries to do something else than Til Schweiger / Schweighöfer standard comedy. Who am I is one of those very rare films from Germany which deals with a serious subject, has a serious tone and plot and can compete with international movies in the same budget range. This movie - regarding the mediocre budget - surprisingly can compete with international films. The plot is constantly exciting, the actors are very good, especially Tom Schilling in the lead role. And the ending is something I have never seen in a German film before. A real mindfvck and very clever.The film is unique in its way to show the Darknet (no spoilers) in a very understandable way. The chosen imagery to show what is going on behind the screen is innovative and is visualized in a way, even people without knowledge of the subject can easily understand and follow the plot. Who am I definitely is one of the best German thrillers I've ever seen and easily one of the best German films in this century so far. It is good to see young and talented German directors get the chance to finally make movies which do not need to hide behind Swedish or french films. This movie thankfully does not feel ""typisch Deutsch"" but much more mature and with a better production design than the ""typical"" German movie feels. Yes, this movie is not very original and has some minor flaws. However, as the first serious German film outside the boring history drama genre in years (the last one was HELL if I remember correctly), I can ignore them. I really hope this film is a door opener for more well-produced German films in the future which might even become international hits. Something, the Swedish and french cinema already achieved. 9 / 10",positive
Jeepers Creepers III,"What were they doing in those 14 years between 2 and 3, staring at their shoelaces? I love the first two films because they are both scary and well made, but WOW, this film is GARBAGE. TRUST ME, this is coming from a HUGE JC fan! The film takes place between the 1st and 2nd movie, which is dumb because nobody wanted to see what happened between the 1st and 2nd movie. I wanted to see what happened after the 2nd movie, but even then, it's really confusing because the plot keeps jumping back and forth between all of these dumb characters. I couldn't tell if the film was set in the present day, in 2001, or in the 70's because of the craptastic pacing. There's even a scene where you can see a 2016 Chevy truck in a film that supposedly takes place in 2001. Speaking of pacing, there is none! Nothing happens in this movie and the film ends right when it should've started! There are so many characters that the film gets lost in itself. The first film had Darry and Trish, simple and easy. The 2nd film had the athletes and a side-plot revolving around an angry father, but it was still easy to follow and well balanced. Here, we have an old lady getting visions from her dead son, then we have Sargeant Tubbs from the first movie, then we have the anti-Creeper gang, then we have some teenagers, then we have a country boy who has a crush on a girl, and said girl also gets her own storyline. All the characters are pointless and are not flushed out because the film is trying so hard to give equal focus to everyone. The CGI is SO BAD and is EVERYWHERE in the film. It's so bad that my theater was laughing louder than the actual movie! The Creeper doesn't do ANYTHING, no smelling fear, eating body parts, he just sorta walks around and grunts. There's one good scene where a group of teenage bikers finds The Creepers truck in the woods, and it's the only good scene in the entire film. That's it! Worst of all, WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE CREEPERS'S ORIGINS!!! I've been waiting nearly 2 decades and we STILL DON'T KNOW WHERE HE COMES FROM??? The film ends on a cliffhanger but I do not want a 4th movie. This feels like it should've been made for the SyFy channel and seeing this on the big screen is like seeing Lake Placid 6 on the big screen. Just don't do it!",negative
Jeepers Creepers III,"Jeepers Creepers 3 is a weird movie going experience. I loved the first one, and really liked the second one. I went into three wanting to love it. I didn't. But here is the weird part. The movie felt like it was never fully finished. Almost like a very rough first draft was the finished product. It almost looked as if they ran out of money before it was completed. It was very strange. If you are a fan of the first two, you will like to see the characters you love. If this is your first experience with the characters, you will be like what the hell did I just watch!",positive
Attack on Titan Part 1,"A few minutes into the movie I was taken by surprise that the director chose to wildly mash up the characters and their relationships. Even though I really like the anime I was open to a new envisionment of the source material, since prejudice is something I try not to practice. Maybe the director wanted a new interpretation, while maintaining the essence of the series. But then it dawned on me that this new interpretation was leaky at best and the capturing of the essence was a parody. It was a 90 minute crap-fest of half-assed dialog, disinterested story telling and slasher-like violence. The movie also had a particular inability of finding a tone. Any tone. All the scenes feel staged, unreal and almost completely unrelated. Most disturbingly however was the implausibility. Nothing seems connected and nobody related. This is a waste of brilliant source material!",negative
Attack on Titan Part 1,"I had an amazing time at the Fantasia showing of this. The audience went wild. The visuals blew me away. If you like classic Godzilla, or better yet, any of the director's Gamera films, this is for you.Classic film effects ratcheted tension to the breaking point. The cheesy characterization was flawless and intentional. Superb experience on many levels. Also loud, but wonderfully loud.Remember the first tingling of fear when you saw Jurassic Park on the big screen? This is that good.If you are not comfortable with anime rules of exposition and emotional outpourings, you might find the human performances awkward, but the lean story moves things along and all the information you need to know about what kind of vividly portrayed vision of hell is going down is amply provided.This is a funhouse horror show.Most of us at the screening loved the melodrama. That's what sometimes works with giant monsters eating human beings and gobs of blood and flesh raining down and oozing out the windows.This movie is dark and grinds away into some truly discomforting terror moments, even as it careens around spiral roads of goofiness at dizzying speeds.If you liked the throwback elements of Fury Road, the classic effects techniques of this giant monster nightmare might appeal. Visually and sonically it was a huge thrill and totally unique. See it big.Does everything work? Who cares. I don't go to the circus for Shakespeare or some huge subtext feast on Netflix.I go to the circus to feel my heart pound as my head explodes.Thank you big screen for staying real.(PS. I think everything works, but I'm no pickier than I need to be to enjoy the ride, and this one's worth it.)",positive
Automata,"In the trailer, this movie had it all, a very solid cast, a very solid budget and an interesting story. After watching it, everything in the movie falls short, problem being central plot. After you reach the end, makes no sense at all. The characters fell flat in every dimension, except Forster and his relationship with main character. The wife, or I should say 'token pregnant wife' is there to give you some insight in the life of Vaucan but no matter how you try, you cannot connect to her plight. Only reason her being there is for the bad guys to take her hostage at the end and. The central story is the ripoff of Three Laws of Robotics, while the story revolves about robots being prohibited to modify themselves. And of course, they do modify themselves and evil company that built them tries to kill them and everyone who found this out. The movie tries to ask interesting questions about free will, but that in the end falls flat, because the main motive of the robots was finding a battery so they can build another robot (for what reasons, it is not explained, not is its shape) and escape into the nuclear wasteland.

Automata,"I really enjoyed this film. I didn't know anything about it before viewing and was pleasantly surprised. I found the plot interesting and the whole film had a fresh and classy feel to it. The locations it was filmed in gave it a very unique look and the directing was perfect in my opinion. Antonio Banderas gave one of the best performances i've seen recently in a sci-fi film and i hope he does more movies in this genre.In parts it reminded me of a cross between Blade Runner and District 9, but with an identity of it's own. It didn't feel like a rip off movie and i would watch it again.Give it a try, i think you'll enjoy it.",positive
Attraction,OMG most idiotic scenario in history of the galaxy!,negative
Attraction,"Since this is a first Russian SiFi movie I watched in this genre, I must say that I am impressed. For the Hollywood SiFi movie lovers, this may not be the perfect match, although visual effects are close in quality. They don't keep you tense for a long duration, there are ""hidden"" messages and human touch in the movie. Its not a John Wayne western type of the movie, like most Hollywood ScFi movies, where you have to kill, die or win on the end for the movie to have some closure. On the bad side of the movie, there are no huge up and down moments in the movie either and ""gang"" (or social) type of violence is on a bit high end for my taste. Some may not like ending itself (Hollywood fans would expect different ending), but from my standpoint it was a very decent ending and still very human.",positive
Light of My Life,"The opening scene of this movie says it all: 10 unrelenting minutes of close, virtually unbroken focus on a father telling his kid a 'bedtime' tale that should have put the kid and any movie viewer into a coma within the first three minutes. This film is a shameless, meaningless ripoff of The Road (2009 - starring Viggo Mortensen), a far superior movie, without any of the drama or tension. Premise: a pandemic that has wiped out the world's female population, without any expansion or context provided to even make it a vaguely credible proposition. The film meanders and muddles its way to the end, at which point the viewer hopes to God it really is the end of the world. What a waste of time.",negative
Light of My Life,"It was riveting. I was glued to the screen from start to finish. Sure, there are some similarities to other stories here and there but I thought it was a beautiful piece of work.Visually Stunning - Those trees and mountains, my goodness!Incredibly Acted - I know the girl is getting a lot of praise for this, as she should, but the real master at work here (I think) is Casey. What an open, touching, raw performance he gave!Beautifully shot - Simple but stunning camera workBelievable - Every moment felt real and very believable. I'm certain things would go down in a very similar fashion if this event ever actually happened. Change my mind.This is a very touching story.

Left Behind,"This was the worst movie I have ever seen. It is clearly destined to go straight to day time television. From the start the movies direction, plot, acting and music all give the impression of a day time drama but much much worse. I don't hate the premise of the movie, it's just like any other sci-fi fiction. However, this movie with it's bad acting and direction make it a complete and utter flop. Too much emphasis is placed on the religious aspects of this story making it feel like a veritable propaganda flick, ruining all chances of immersing in the story-line.Do not waste your money on such a poorly produced movie. Religious or not, you will walk out of the theatre with nothing but regrets.",positive
Mr. Peabody & Sherman,"Warning: This entire review can be considered ""spoiler"" material, but it may save you from wasting a night out. Mr. Peabody and Sherman, is, without question, the worst movie of the year and absolutely should not be seen by elementary school age children. The movie starts out simple enough...then the bully clichés hit: Sherman is bullied by a girl; Peabody is bullied by a social worker. A social worker makes arbitrary and bigoted decisions based on a bully persona. And the family of the offending girl (the one who bullied Sherman in the beginning): White Yuppee Dad is definitely the boss with little wifey cow-towing to his ""my little angel can't do anything wrong"" attitude, regardless of her alleged opinions and peace-making efforts.In terms of how this ""film"" relates to the original Sherman & Peabody, as part of the Rocky & Bullwinkle Show: It doesn't. The original show had the two principals going back in time to a famous place or event. Sherman usually got into trouble and Peabody saved the day. Very innocent and known to us kids of the time to be a farce...like the accompanying ""Fractured Fairy Tales."" The Peabody in this film is a narcissistic megalomaniac; nothing like the character should have been. Very sad to see. Oh, and while I am at it...for any ""Family Guy"" fans familiar with the Griffin's neighbor ""Joe"" the cop....the Roman character in this film is ""Joe""...actually the same character drawn with the strong jaw and same voice. It doesn't work. So, for a guy who raced home after school and got up early on Saturdays to watch the Rocky & Bullwinkle Show with Mr. Peabody and Sherman, this movie failed in every aspect that a movie could fail, except for the animation. The animation was commendable.",negative
Mr. Peabody & Sherman,"I briefly remember the old Mr.Peabody and Sherman cartoons, the thing I'm glad here is that they did not try to make it live action, and make Mr.Peabody a CGI thing. They over did it with The Smurfs and the Soooby Doos.Building a time traveling adventure story with the smart dog Mr. Peabody and his adopted human son named Sherman. Has the two meet some of the famous and some infamous people of history. But it also the warmth father and son relationship between Peabody and Sherman. It never takes it self to seriously, it is just fun ride for everybody to enjoy. Ty Burrell voices Mr. Peabody with perfection, the rest of the cast are also great, the animation is top notch also.",positive
The Darkest Minds,Personally I disagree with IMDB's low rating - I really enjoyed this film,negative
The Darkest Minds,"To be honest, I am not sure why lots of people dislike this film. However, I can personally say that I enjoyed this film immensely. Being a fan of the book series, I was already excited for the film's release, but was nervous about the YA novel adaptation. However, I feel that while the book and film are different in many ways (as they have to be, as there are things in the novel that can't be done easily on screen), the production team did a wonderful job of making the film their own, but sticking to the novel very well. Although it seemed fast paced at times, I was eager to see what would happen next. My mom, who has never read the series, left the theater and said ""well, now I'm going to have to steal the second book from you and read it, because I can't wait until another movie to see what happens!""
Please, do not listen to the negative reviews, and go see this film for yourself. I had the incredible opportunity to be a background extra on the set of the film, and saw firsthand how hard both the cast and crew worked to bring this film to life. Please go support to not only see an incredible storyline come to life, but to encourage future YA novel adaptations, female directors, and inclusive/diverse casting.",positive
How I Live Now,"There is some extraordinary sensitivity in Saoirse Ronan that made me watch the trailer that eventually led me to the movie. It is beautifully shot drama. Its dynamics created by the sequence of light and darkness, nature and civilization is so captivating that you are up in it right till the end.The portrayal of a nuclear war is not too light so it is believable, but not too dark so it leaves you hope. The film deals with the great theme of significant vs petty in life which makes you once again to think about what you really care about in this raw nerved life. There is some reaffirming conclusions about the one's will power that can do much greater deal that helping restrain the desire for chocolate,which could've been brought a bit further. But overall it is an interesting movie that asks the right questions, the only right answers being within each and everyone of us.",negative
How I Live Now,"Of all the movies I've seen, this is up there with the best. It's perfect in its variations of tone, from the lyrical to the grisly, and paced so that I never failed to be engaged with it. It avoids being over-elaborate or over-clever.We are drawn in by comedy. Stroppy American teenager Daisy (Saoirse Ronan) flies in to stay with her English cousins and so far as she's concerned, she's landed in Hicksville. They live a carefree, mostly adult-free existence in a ramshackle farmhouse with animals all over the place, unwashed crockery and a casual approach to eating. Just what you want when you've got OCD, food fads and medication. Determined to sulk in her room, she is eventually drawn out and succumbs to the warmth of her cousins, 14-year-old Isaac (Tom Holland), younger sister Piper (Harley Bird) and older brother Edmond (George MacKay}.But in the background there are rumblings, particularly of a nuclear bomb which has been detonated in London. In the foreground, Daisy's and Edmond's hormones are rumbling.The sex scene, when it comes, is how it should be done: lovely without being too explicit, too long or salacious. That's followed by soldiers arriving, guns blazing, to impose martial law. Boys and girls are split up to be taken to separate camps, but Edmond and Daisy vow to be reunited. Daisy's escape is a grim survival scenario in which she has to practically force-march Piper to exhaustion through a landscape beset with dangers, particularly for vulnerable females of any age. Who will survive? The acting? Well, there's acting, good acting and acting so good that you forget that it's acting, and Ronan's and Bird's acting both come into this last category. I was totally absorbed in their journey. It's very, very rare for me to lose my sense of detachment when I'm watching a film but I did here. Few people have doubted Ronan's ability since her impressive performance as the 13-year-old Briony Tallis in Atonement. However, I've sometimes felt that she has been the victim of a misguided director (Peter Jackson in The Lovely Bones) or a substandard screenplay (The Host). I've often wondered when she would get more material worthy of her talent. Well, boy, has she hit the jackpot this time. Director Kevin Macdonald did everything he had to do to get the story across without any of those irritating ""look what a wonderful director I am"" flourishes. People will inevitably draw comparisons with Meg Rosoff's novel, which I haven't read, or other films in this ""genre"". How I detest the pretentious overuse of that word. This film was enough for me and if you don't think it measures up to your precious novel or your precious genre that's your problem, not mine.",positive

If you like The Butterfly Effect, or Source Code (where the theme is fixing events within a time sequence) then this NEEDS to be added to your watch list. Why this movie got bad reviews: People generally don't like found footage films; people also overthink the time line.

Imdb has not listed any budget for this movie and that is because there is no budget. CGI is awful, explosions and gunfire is so fake that there are no words to describe how bad it is.

Absolutely Anything,"I am actually watching the ending of this drivel as I am writing this review. I was expecting at least some 'comedy' moments as Simon Pegg was in it - but how wrong I was! Everything about it was feeble - I can't recall anything that was in anyway funny. Most of the 'I can do anything' moments were cringeworthy and predictable - with the talent of the writers on offer, I would have hoped for a lot better. The American stalker - an absolute crap idea, crappily acted - didn't make any sense at all. The Alien conclave - typical Monty Python - but not funny! The 'lets all worship Ray' montage - embarrassing from start to finish. And finally the talking dog - a sad end to the late Robin Williams legacy. The only redeeming part is that He will not remembered for this as it will soon be forgotten about when it is in the 50pence bin in charity shops. Don't waste your time with it - I can only assume that the 6 out of ten voters were stoned or under the influence of some heavy drugs.",negative
Absolutely Anything,"In this day and age with what seems like endless Hollywood blockbusters coming out a lot of movie goers seem to expect Oscar worth films with every purchase but not every film can have timeless performances or a flawless scripts!This film is what I call a perfect lazy film, it's simple, funny, charming and really makes you relax. It's effortless to watch and thoroughly enjoyable. The plot is obviously not going to be feasible but it doesn't have to be.... Sometimes imaginations stretch far from the norm, that's the beauty of cinema. I felt this film, however far fetched still felt real, a lot of the things he used the powers on were believable and true to what many regular people would do!Robin Williams from beyond the grave stole the show as Dexter, another reminder of what a great and versatile actor he was, he was perfect and that angle was great!! However the rest of the relationships seemed a bit offish, in the opening exchanges Ray and Neil didn't seem to particularly like each other so the jump to them as best mates felt false. Sadly there seemed to be no chemistry between pegg and beckinsdale, the idea of the love blossoming without power would have been beautiful had the actual spark been visible and not a case of him lusting after a slightly stuck up neighbour who happens to be fit! That was the only downfall but Williams coupled with monty Python were great! Pegg was his usual self, he seems to play the same sort of hapless goofy loser in every film, this worked, much like the worlds end its dependant on you liking pegg as an actor, if you don't you may dislike it but the unusual nature and overall quirkiness of the film make it enjoyable for the whole family bar 2-3 pg moments and bits of bad language.Easy to watch and will leave you smiling",positive
The One I Love,"If you go past the overall poor acting and flat dialogues, you get to a plot that might turn interesting. It actually managed to get me excited for a few minute, even if it was after a very long bored waiting for the pain to go. The characters are overly understanding, OK and chill with the whole situation. They even ask for more. You get so little attached to any of the characters that whatever happens is of little interest to you. Annoyment is also apparently the most they can feel and you would be probably less shocked by their behavior if they were teenagers, not a married couple. Some queues by the DP on his way to shoot the movie give away a part of the plot, luckily it's has no point in the end, as most other queues to a deeper meaning. In the end you get a poor Peter Pan story, a few nice shots (if you like trees and lens flare...) and the most expected, uninspired and badly brought over end you could find to this story. All this in the most convoluted package you could think off... It's sad, it was very close to a pretty good plot for a RomCom, but it doesn't get there. You end up wondering why they even bothered to make things so complicated... Bad enough to motivate my first written review on IMDb!",negative
The One I Love,"It's hard to relay the joy I felt watching The One I Love, Charlie McDowell's first full-length feature. It's the kind of film you'll remember for a long time because it breaks so many boundaries. It's the kind of film Spike Jonze might come up with, minus some of the academic pretensions he sometimes clings to.The trailer for The One I Love is almost perfect. It doesn't spoil the premise of the film, and neither will I.Mark Duplass (who also produced along with his bro, of course) and Elizabeth Moss are excellently cast as Ethan and Sophie, two not-so-newlyweds who are encountering all too typical problems ""relating.""At the suggestion of their therapist (Ted Danson, in a just-right cameo) they spend a weekend at a rather large rental house, unsuspecting of the lengths their counselor is willing to go to in order to motivate them to ""connect."" The One I Love is a high-wire act by anyone's standards. The script is especially brilliant, but it doesn't spit its brilliance in your face constantly and then ask for your approval with laughter or the occasional tear. Instead, it dabbles in elements of Sci-Fi and Fantasy but doesn't let the main characters (or the audience) off easily by subjugating the human story to questions of logistics. In other words, this isn't a movie for the compulsively left-brained and anal. The performances and plot are engaging enough to make you accept this often absurd but always engaging film for what it is.It takes guts to break the rules, even more talent to make it work. With The One I Love, Charlie McDowell seems destined to reprove the adage that talent runs in the family.",positive
Teen Titans GO! To the Movies,"If you're looking for a fun time at the movies and don't want a plot quite as intense as mission impossible, I suggest you check this out. The irreverent humor and many references will keep even the most avid cynic of this show intrigued.
What this movie has that too many adult comedies lack is a heart. I was genuinely surprised that I actually cared about Robin's ups and downs throughout the movie due to the surprisingly well-written story. Yes, the movie has the occasional fart joke, but it's not overdone. In fact, the movie is quite aware that those types of jokes aren't for everyone, so it often utilizes them to make fun of itself.
It is at times a little predictable, but it has enough going for it that makes the story thematically consistent. It even references it's own cliches and predictableness in a funny way.
My only main complaint is the pacing. I think the main reason for this is that the story appears to have its conflict resolve, and it takes awhile for the story to pick up steam again.
Comedies can often get overly cynical, but this movie looks to appeal to the heart of the fanboy and dreamer in all of us and accomplishes it. Even if you don't like the movie, I suggest you stick around for the end credits scene because it's got something older fans can get excited for.",negative

The Zero Theorem,"'The Zero Theorem' is directed by Terry Gilliam, a highly original creator and an explorer of the future, which he already described in rather dark colors in several memorable films like 'Brazil' and 'Twelve Monkeys'. His other principal title of glory, the 'Monty Python' series, somehow balances in his filmography the concept of anticipation with the one of an alternate present or past in the comic registry. 'The Zero Theorem' was shot mostly in Romania, and part of the technical team and actors are Romanian, to the extent the in the program of the festival I saw the film in it was classified as a an English-Romanian co-production.In the fantastic scenery of an abandoned church that some of my Bucharest friends might recognize we find the hero of the film (played brilliantly by Christoph Waltz), a specialist in 'processing entities'. working frantically on a mission entrusted by a large corporation whose chief is called impersonal 'The Management' (Matt Damon), a mission whose goal may be finding the meaning of existence, or an absurd demonstration that accumulation of full (100%) is equal to the Great Zero. Or perhaps the essence of human existence and the absurd are the same? Actually it does not really matter, because the story and the logic of the film is focused on the frantic and obsessive search of the main character. Or maybe this is human nature, a continuous search that ends in nothing? Or in the Infinity? We find in this film's many of the visual metaphors Terry Gillman used us to, in a colorful world activated by a strange retro-advanced technology, like belonging to a branching of time for human scientific developments that extends the early 20th century. We also find a fierce critique of large international corporations - the main character is provided with such items of 'personal development' like a virtual-dream love relationship (with gorgeous Gwendoline Christie) or psychoanalysis through tele-presence (by severe Tilda Swinton). He is subjected to tracking methods that infiltrate his privacy inspired by Orwell's '1984' and Gilliam's own 'Brazil' and also terrorized by a small and despotic manager, a familiar figure many of those who worked in large global corporations may find familiar.'The Zero Theorem' is first of all a wonderful visual experience. It is also a film that does not open immediately all its secret doors, but gives the impression of depth and complexity that calls for a second and maybe more viewings.",negative
The Zero Theorem,"Terry Gilliam is back with one of his better films in recent years. It's also one of his more philosophical films, as it grapples with many deep questions, including the meaning of life itself. Gilliam calls ""The Zero Theorem"" the third instalment in his dystopian satire trilogy, which began with ""Brazil"" in 1985 and was followed by ""Twelve Monkeys"" in 1995.""The Zero Theorem"" follows the story of Qohen Leth, a number-crunching programmer at a large corporation called Mancom. While struggling with life in general, Qohen is given the job of solving the zero theorem, a mysterious mathematical equation that continually eludes his grasp. The task is complicated by some new personal relationships when he meets Bainsley, a tempting Internet stripper, and Bob, the 15 year old, genius son of the CEO of Mancom. Have they entered his life to help Qohen, or are they merely unnecessary distractions from his work? Qohen is often unsure about the answer to that question.The world of the film resembles that of Gilliam's previous two dystopian satires, but this is its own film and it deals with some new themes and conflicts. I'd say the themes and questions are even deeper here, because Gilliam is struggling with the meaning of life itself. Anyway, it all works and leads to an intriguing and visually engaging story. ""The Zero Theorem"" gets a big thumbs up from me. You should definitely check out this one, especially if you're a fan of Gilliam's earlier work.",positive

"I, Frankenstein","There's something to be said for big, dumb blockbusters featuring immortal creatures of the undead, gargoyles, demons and a whole lot of CGI. That's especially true now, during awards season, when the cinemas are otherwise crowded with Important Movies that might be worthy but difficult to watch. I, Frankenstein even lurches into cineplexes with a bit more credibility than is typically attached to C-grade movies: usually reliable character actors Aaron Eckhart, Miranda Otto and Bill Nighy have signed on to rain hellfire (or something) down on one another. It's a shame, then, that the overly dour film wastes rather than benefits from their talents.Forced into a shambling semblance of life, Victor Frankenstein's dark, brooding creation (Eckhart) stalks bitterly through the centuries. He's hunted mercilessly by the forces of evil - flame-streaked demons led by the nefarious Prince Naberius (Nighy). On the side of good are the gargoyles, a peaceable clan who enjoy the blessing of the heavens and are led by the beautiful Queen Leonore (Otto). Bequeathed the name of Adam by Leonore, Frankenstein's creature soon discovers that he is the factor that could tip the scales in the immortal battle between the demons and the gargoyles.I, Frankenstein is entirely too grim for its own good. Kevin Grevioux's screenplay, adapted from his graphic novel of the same title, marches forward in workmanlike fashion. Plot 'twists' can be seen coming from miles away - see the sassy blonde scientist (Yvonne Strahovski) directed to investigate Adam's origins grow increasingly fascinated with her science project! There are precious few shades of complexity to be found in the film, the characters never really breaking free of their archetypes - beyond the fact that the good guys morph into huge, stony, winged gargoyles that aren't particularly pleasing to the eye. Fiery explosions and bone-crunching battles abound, but they never amount to very much in emotional terms.The unexpectedly good cast liven things up a little, though not by enough to drag I, Frankenstein out of the doldrums. Eckhart storms stoically through the film, a singular grave expression carved into his features like so much rigor mortis. Nighy seems to be having fun even while phoning in his performance. As for Otto and Strahovski, both actresses are competent but largely colourless in their roles.Genre flicks like this one don't usually have to check a lot of boxes to be fun nights out at the cinema. The Underworld franchise - from the same producers - proved just that, spinning its surprisingly rich tale into four films that haven't been critically successful but have nevertheless cultivated their own fans. On the strength (or lack thereof) of the gloomy, predictable I, Frankenstein, it seems unlikely that it will kickstart a new franchise in quite the same way.",negative
"I, Frankenstein","Don't get where all these negative comments come from. I, Frankenstein isn't that bad.I very much liked the new take on the story but it seems like a lot of you guys just wanted to see a remake of the original. Well just watch the original than. Aaron Eckhart plays the role of the tormented monster excellent. I also liked Yvonne Strahovski's performance. Overall the cast was very good.The special effect where great what makes watching the fights very entertaining. I read a lot of reviews where they say that it all looked very fake and copied. Well it did't to me. In my eyes it was worth watching and deserves an 8/10. If however you hope to see the tale of Frankenstein like it was in the original movie this maybe isn't for you.",positive
The Girl with All the Gifts,"I know many of you reading this probably won't care, because of the praise this movie is getting, but this is one of the most blatant rip offs I have seen in recent memory.Let me recap: The story involves a post apocalyptic setting where a strain of Cordyceps fungus has mutated. Infecting most of the population, turning them into violent mutated zombie like humans who attack and eat anyone and anything. The fungus is transmitted through bites, but the longer humans are infected they can begin to spread the disease by becoming immobile and beginning sprouting pods that shoot spores into the air, spreading the fungi even more. But years after the infection begins we find a girl. A special girl who is immune to the effects of the fungus. A group searching for a cure learns of the girl and wants to bring her to a center/base to use her to create the cure. She has a protector that starts off looking after her as just a job, but begins to care for her. But then her protector learns that creating the cure with the help of this special girl involves killing her. Now they have to decide if they can live with sacrificing her to save the world. And now you have the full plot of The Last of Us. A critically acclaimed and award winning video game that came out in the summer of 2013. A full YEAR before the book was even published. Could this be a coincidence? Sure. Maybe. But come on...This gets a 1 star for being a complete rip off and doing it worse than the video game. If it wasn't a rip off it would be an OK movie at best.",negative
The Girl with All the Gifts,"I remember once having a ridiculous drunken dispute at a works Christmas party many year's ago that went along the lines of ""if you had the chance to save the world, but had to kill your child to do it, what would you do"". There's a variant of this conundrum at the heart of this brilliant new film from Colm McCarthy, best know for his TV work on shows like ""Peaky Blinders"", ""Sherlock"" and ""Dr Who"".As most people already realize, this is a 'Zombie film' (cue, a number of other single blokes in the cinema) and illustrates the dangers of not treating that Athlete's Foot as soon as it appears! I would normally provide a quick synopsis here, but I really think this is a case in point where it is best to go into the film as blind as possible to the story and let it envelop you. (This includes not watching the whole trailer if possible.) To merely set the scene, we open with a morning school ritual like none you've seen before: children strapped to wheelchairs by heavily armed military in their cells; wheeled to an underground classroom; then made to sit in serried rows being taught by their teacher Helen Justineau (a deliciously un-made-up and natural Gemma Arterton). What IS going on? Who ARE these children? WHY are the soldiers so scared and dismissive of them? The ever-great Paddy Considine (""Pride"") plays army Sergeant Parks (who also has a bit of a crush on Helen) and Glenn Close plays Dr Caroline Caldwell, who is studying the children in more ways than one.This trio of stars, supported notably later in the film by Fisayo Akinade as the trooper Kieran, turn in what is a superb ensemble performance. As for Glenn Close, I have never quite been able to shake her awful ""silk blouse"" performance in ""Air Force One"" from my mind, but here she is quite mesmerizing in the role of the Doctor on a mission: I would suggest a career best. Her final scene reflects such a complex range of emotions, and is brilliantly executed. And Gemma Arterton pulls out all the emotional stops in what is also one of the performances of the year.But good as these performances are, they would be nothing without the central performance of young Sennia Nanua as the titular ""Girl"". I have made the point before that there should be an Oscar category for ""Young Actors"" rather than pitch them into the adult categories like Quvenzhane Wallis and Anna Paquin were (successfully). Here in her debut feature performance Sennia is just mesmerising and (provided this film gets the recognition it justly deserves) she should be a shoe-in for the BAFTA Rising Star award next year, if not an Actress nomination. A young lady most definitely to watch.Also assuming a starring role is Chilean-born composer Cristobal Tapia de Veer's astonishingly effective music which drives up the tension superbly. This is his feature film debut and another name to watch.The screenplay by Mike Carey from his original novel is beautifully crafted, with some great one liners dropped in to ease the tension a notch. And the story adds a level of emotional depth and angst that surpasses other films of this genre, at least as far back as the ""28 Days"" films.Astonishingly, the film was made on a budget of 4 (FOUR!) Million Pounds, giving it a 'BvS quotient' (see bob-the-movie-man.com!) of 2.1%!! Every penny of that budget is up on the screen, and whilst you might like to pick at a few of the matte paintings and effects, it is a remarkably achievement in special effects (Nick Rideout is the SF supervisor) and production value.So, its great! Go see it... but with a few caveats: it is a zombie film, and it ranks about an 8.9 on the splattometer scale, which might not be to some tastes; definitely don't go to see it if you are pregnant (though I am constantly reminded how I took my heavily pregnant wife in 1989 to see ""A really great film called 'Alien'""); and you might want to avoid it if you are a great cat or dog lover, or indeed a pigeon-fancier. Other than that, get yourself down to a multiplex and see this great British film: surely a classic to be recognized for years to come.(You can read the full graphical version of this review on bob-the-movie-man.com.

2:22,"Although production values were fine, the story was confused, evolved far too slowly without a sense of progression, and ultimately never came close to an ending that merited the tedious slog through the movie.My companion for the evening is a big (and tolerant) sci-fi fan, but she was fidgeting early on in the movie, and when a character utters the words, ""I'm so sorry about tonight"" I could only turn to her and repeat the line.If you're looking for a thought-provoking sci-fi movie, you can skip this one, and if you are expecting a romance along the lines of The Time Traveler's Wife or The Lake House, the story and performances are just not compelling enough to pull that off.Sorry, but give it a miss.",negative
2:22,"I don't know why this movie has such a poor rating. Then when I read those reviewers who rated this low, I understood. They rated it such because they didn't understand the movie. Figures, when you don't get the movie, you bash it? This movie requires a broader, keener mind to appreciate it. This movie actually reminded me of Frequency, where a cosmic occurrence triggered supernatural events. Sure, it also had a sci-fi feel to it, the past colliding with the present. It wasn't confusing for me at all. Everything was connected, and maybe only a few people can see that.I think the reviews would be better if they had bigger-named stars, but because the cast are more B-list, somehow the bias is a low-budget film can't be good. But that is not the case here. Story is good, directing is good, cinematography and editing were stellar, and the music is awesome. Did I say the music is awesome? I'll say it again: the soundtrack is AWESOME! Very few movies had me googling the tracklist as soon as the movie finished. The music fits the movie perfectly.Sure, there are parts where it could've been better, but as it is, I really enjoyed the movie and I think it deserves a higher rating.",positive
The Wandering Earth,"I'm baffled by this film and the positive reviews. Despite the fact that it's packed with big set-piece moments, it's dull and hollow. The characters are cardboard cutouts and virtually every element is derivative of American blockbusters. It's Armageddon, Interstellar, Gravity, 2001, and 2012 all mashed up into a barely coherent pastiche.There is only the thinnest veneer of characterization and it's incredibly cliche. There is a rebellious kid who misses his father, a wacky weird side-character with funny hair, a father who had to leave his son, an army guy bound to duty, a comedic genius computer guy. Except none of these characters have chemistry.The premise is so absurd there is little point in explaining it.I'm confused how something like this got green-lit because it isn't even good as propaganda. It is surprisingly devoid of culture. Sure, there are Chinese flags, and Chinese people everywhere, and they celebrate Chinese New Year, but it hardly 'sells' Chinese culture (fashion, music, art). In fact, it just waters down Chinese culture to make it internationally palatable.Everything feels like it's from a checklist, as if they know they have to hit certain notes to imitate a masterpiece, but don't know how to string it together. The CGI effects aren't even good. It's just an assault on the eyes of how much stuff they can cram on the screen.The sound design and sound mixing is also terrible. There is a lack of sound effects and music needed to add depth to the world. It sounds empty and cheap. The music itself is terribly derivative of an American blockbuster.The high user review scores are disappointing because it sets the bar very low for Chinese blockbusters.",negative
The Wandering Earth,"This is so far the best scifi Chinese movie i have ever seen. Honestly speaking, this movie is far more better than similar hollywood movies. if you are not sinophobia and can accept mostly chinese (with subtitle), it will not not let you regret.",positive
Cell,"First... I did not know anything about this awesome, and I can't say that enough, awesome book becoming a movie. I have had to read this book at least 10 times over the last few years and some of my most favorite life quotes came from this book. So when I saw this as a movie and John as the main role I knew it was going to be amazing. I mean if I could cast the main character myself it would be John.BUT... Well, if the director had made a movie out of the book, it would have been amazing. If the movie had any of the most notable and required pieces of the plot it would have been amazing. If the director had even read anything to do with the book, even the dust jacket, it would have been amazing. But he didn't, he didn't, he didn't.SO... The movie sucked. I don't like to use that type of ""language"" when reviewing anything, but there is no other choices here. Everything about the movie was wrong and I gave it a lot of room, a lot of space to make errors and not flow the same. Because ultimately you want to be surprised by the movie. You ultimately want the director to make it his own just a little bit, put his spin on something and have it shine even more. And I did, I watched the movie to the very end. Checked behind the credits and everything. And now I wish I would have gone on for the rest of my life without knowing this movie existed. IF... Now one might think by my review that had you not read the book, you might have liked it but sadly that is not true. This is not only the worst adaptation of a book ever, but it is also just poorly put together, scripted, acted, and there is no redeemable quality anywhere.Such as... The sound effects were horrible, the video tried to be dark and creepy, but it was just bland. There was very little action or scare factor other than some BOO moments from the ""zombies type people."" If you didn't see something coming from a mile away it is because it made no sense. The ending was a little baffling on how horrible it was. I mean I am actually trying to think of one thing. Just one that I can say and would take this movie from a 1 star to at least a 1.5 star. But I can't. I can't think of a single thing that I can look back on and say that was cool/nice/awesome/not terrible.Lastly... So I will leave you with this. I am actually praying that I reach you before you watched this movie. I am hoping one of your not nice friends didn't play a prank on you and made you pay for this movie. It is my desire that this review has reached you before you have wasted one single heartbeat within the vicinity of this horrible, horrible film mistake. And I thank you for reading my review and I am sorry to those that I did not reach in time.Joshua Kyte",negative
Cell,"I must say I don't really understand the negative reviews. I've read and loved the book, but I was always aware that the movie was not going to be an exact copy of it. Yes, people who expected it to be will be disappointed, but don't spoil the fun for others who just want to see a good movie - because it is still a good movie in itself. Giving a movie a bad rating just because it didn't meet your personal expectations is kind of stupid. You should always try to see the movie and book separately. Some scenes, when translated to a movie screen, just don't come out the same way. What sounds amazing in a novel doesn't need to look fantastic in theaters. And that's coming from a writer.Of course, it is a lot harder to make you feel for the characters on a screen than when you read about them in detail. I still felt for the characters. I like that the movie changed a couple of things, but still kept stuff that will remind you of the book (Alice's white dress, the ice cream truck etc....) Some of those book references were used in a different way, but it made me smile. The new ideas were pretty unique and I don't want to spoil the experience. I think the most important parts were still well performed and - last but not least - it was entertaining, interesting, different, suspenseful. 8 Stars - I take two stars away, because some improvements could have been made.",positive
Equals,"This is SUCH a tired theme... sterile emotionless future society, yet two people are different, fall in love, and fight the system... When George Orwell did it in ""1984"" it was still reasonably fresh, but that was almost 70 years ago.""Equals"" stars Nicholas Hoult (the creepy kid from ""About a Boy"" grown up, and even creepier) and Kristen Stewart (known catatonic) really have no chemistry and the movie gives them no reason to be together except they're both ""different."" Watching on DVD, I saw a lot of visual ""banding"" issues, and the audio was largely, well, inaudible. And this universe is all touchscreens and barcode scanners that constantly ping and whoo, which becomes really grating even 10 minutes in... ick.Instead of this, I'd suggest ""Gattaca"" -- http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119177/ -- That was 20 years ago, and the premise was already getting threadbare by then, but at least there are some interesting stakes and twists and performances from Jude Law, Alan Arkin, Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke.Or maybe ""The Island"" -- http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399201/ -- yes, Michael Bay, so plenty o' 'splosions, but at least it's a decent premise and has lots of good twists.Even good old ""Logan's Run"" -- http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074812/ -- handles this material in a more interesting manner -- it's pretty cheesy in terms of effects and costumes (it was 40 years ago so cut it some slack), but much more fun.The commentary on the disc tries to position the film as some great love story that just happens to be set in this cliché future, but there's almost nothing there. Skip it, or at least lower your expectations.",negative
Equals,"I don't think this film deserves the bad reviews it is receiving. Of course everyone has different opinions on a great film. Personally, a movie is good (or great or excellent) if it sticks with me for a while after. I found myself thinking about the main characters for a few days after watching it at the Toronto International Film Festival. This film made me feel many emotions for the characters -which is very ironic considering the main theme of Equals. I thought Kristen Stewart and Nicholas Hoult had excellent chemistry and portrayed their characters so wonderfully, and that's an impressive accomplishment if you remember the characters for the most part are supposed to be emotionless.",positive
Men & Chicken,"As funny as ""Blinkende Lygter"" (Anders Thomas Jensens directorial debut) is, it's difficult to find anything funny about this retarded turd of a movie.The movie deals with bestiality, genetic splicings of humans and animals and violence. These things would be fine in movies like ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Wrong Turn"" and ""The hills have eyes"" but not in a comedy. Me and my friend laughed a little but when the movie finally ended we were glad we had not wasted money watching it at the cinema.I can't think of a single redeeming thing to say about this braindead movie. Just avoid it. If you didn't like ""Adams Æbler and ""De grønne slagtere"" you will definitely not like ""Mænd og høns"".It's funny how the professional danish movie critics always say, how movies like this one is a fresh of breath air, amongst all the serious dramas, that Denmark is mostly known for. When the truth is that movies like this one suck even more than the boring dramas and as a viewer I get the feeling that those critics have been paid by the producers of the movie to say nice things about it.Because if they really praise a movie like this they're clueless when it comes to recognizing good movies.",negative
Men & Chicken,"OK. Admittedly, I'm biased. I'm an enormous fan of Anders Thomas Jensen's movies and pretty much adore everything he's ever made or been even tangentially involved in, but up until now I was very firmly of the belief that 'Blinkende Lygter' was and would always remain my favourite of ATJ's movies. That was until I saw 'Mænd & Høns' and fell completely and traitorously in love.A perfect balance of black (oh god so so black) humour and pathos, this movie is a testament to ATJ's wonderfully deft touch with both. The characters, surreal and ridiculous as they are, are played with such humanity and conviction, that one cannot help but love them all, every last weird, disgusting one of them. As dual-lead, David Dencik is both loathsome and pathetically lovable as Gabriel. Nicolas Bro is a delight as always as the loquacious over-sharing Joseph, as is an almost unrecognisable Søren Malling as Franz. However, whereas it's normally Nicolaj Lie Haas that takes the comedic football and runs uncontested for the touchline, 'Mænd & Høns' is (definitely) Mads Mikkelsen's movie. As the compulsively masturbating, bombastic Elias, Mikkelsen reaps the lion's share of the comedic lines, delivering them with such incredible timing and bravado you can't help but think he missed his vocation when he opted for a career as leading-man heart-throb over bumbling idiotic funnyman.I can't say enough good about this film. Watch it as soon as a UK release is available. Talk about it until there is. Petition your local cinemas. Buy 'Mænd & høns' t-shirts and bore your friends. I know I will.",positive
Fahrenheit 451,"If I could insert the ""ironic"" meme that uses Palpatine from the Star Wars prequels, I would. Ray Bradbury's classic book was about how media dumbs down the populace and how books were censored to keep people from thinking freely, which is exactly what the makers of this movie did. They dumbed down the themes of the source material and put them through the PC spin machine to create a film that exemplifies exactly what Bradbury warned about. It only got more than one star because of the great visuals and acting from Shannon.",negative
Fahrenheit 451,"This was going to be bad.... The line "" you dream of running from me, you wake up and apologize"" (Or something like that) made me think that I didn't know if I could make it through this movie. Which is a shame because I really like both lead actors. Maybe the director just didn't direct them correctly but Ray Bradbury must be turning in his grave at this retelling. I've seen the movie Equilibrium which is loosely based on the book, and while it's no masterpiece it is boatloads better than this",positive
The Space Between Us,"Is there anything more infuriating than people who know nothing about science trying to make a film/write a book about science? It seems like they didn't have a single person on board who knew anything about ANYTHING. I'm not even a scientist and I could have come up with a dozen ways to work around all these ""issues"" that were driving the story onward.This film is a plot hole after another plot hole, the most infuriating part being that the whole story didn't need to happen.!!!!!Here come the spoilers!!!!!!:1. There's no way the mother would have passed the health checks while being pregnant. They're pretty thorough. Not only that, she appeared to be a good 5+ months pregnant when the mission started - absolutely no way in hell no one would have realised (even discounting the vigorous health checks).2. WTF did they feed the newborn baby? The mother died, and I presume no one thought to pack baby formula for the astronauts to drink.3. They could have brought the child back when the mission was due to return. First of all, 2/3 gravity isn't a big enough difference to even on its own to cause irreparable damage. I'm certain they could have helped get his body used to a higher gravity by exercising him and making him wear weights or something. Even without all that, they could have simply helped his body and his heart adjust to Earth's high gravity by for example putting him in a freaking water tank, idk. There are ways.4. He (Gardner) has instantaneous communication with earth, and access to the internet (and presumably everything it has to offer), he's apparently a genius, and he was indeed raised among humans - even if they were only ""scientists"", rather than ""loving parents"" who would teach him all about life - yet somehow half the time he's acting like a socially retarded 5-year-old who has never seen even a picture of horse?! Uh-huh. This whole person-from-a-different-time-or-space-is- overwhelmed-by-the-present thing has been done a million times before; it's an old joke, and this time they failed massively.5. Even though he's now old he could have still done the physical therapy I mentioned earlier. Better late than never!6. I love how in the beginning of the film they make a point to mention that Earth's resources are pretty much depleted and all that jazz, but then 16 years later they can afford to send a rocket to space just to send a Martian and his father back home. You know how many resources it takes to build a rocket and fuel it? Even if the rocket was part of a mission that was already going there (conveniently leaving so soon after Gardner nearly died), those seats are valuable, and there are no spares.Alas, that's not even all of it, but those are the biggest, most glaring plot holes that drove me nuts due to the fact that they rendered the whole film pointless.And all this is ignoring the generally poor story line, shallow character design, crappy writing, and mediocre acting. Ugh.",negative
The Space Between Us,"Some of the reviews I have read must have come from those without a beating heart. I finally took the time to watch this film as the reviews were not great. I had an understanding it was a little sci-fi and a lot teenage love story going in. I found the screenplay to be brilliant by such young actors. I also understand there should be some fantastic things in a movie that includes sci-fi so while some of what the teenage couple set out to do seems unrealistic, it fits for what story the director and writer were trying to give us. I wish more adults could express the feelings this movie tries to tell us not to hide, and to enjoy every moment of life that is afforded to us. I found this movie not only heart warming but uplifting and inspiring. Thank you for such a much need film of this type. It has been a while. Take the fantastical with a grain of salt and pay attention to what it is trying to share, we may just all benefit from that thought process rather than the cynical one.",positive
The Void,Spoilers ahead. None of the plots are ever explained. Why was the first couple in the farm house being hunted by the 2 men? Why couldn't one of those men talk? He was silent the entire film and it never said why. They set the girl on fire? What did she ever do? The guy said he went there just to do some drugs so that made no sense. Why was the cop car moved away from the hospital by an extra 100 feet? He still had the keys on him. The cop chopped up his wife with an ax then it shows him in his same cop uniform while she changed clothes holding his hand in the end. Never shown what happened to the Doctor once he entered the void. Why did anyone else need to go into the basement besides the cop looking for his wife? The Asian girl who stayed up top was the only smart one.,negative
The Void,"I saw this movie at the Festival du film Fantastique (Gerardmer, France). We were watching 6 movies per day for 3 days in a row, ""The Void"" was the last movie we were going to see for the day and I had absolutely no idea what it was about. In fact I thought it was a sci-fi movie when we stepped into the theater, and boy am I glad we did not know more ; we were in for quite a ride.If you plan on watching the movie, I strongly advise you to stop reading/watching any type of review, teaser, trailer or any form of info about it. Not that I am going to spoil anything here, but I believe this movie is enjoyed much better if you know absolutely nothing about it. If you've seen the poster you already know too much. OK you might be wondering ""What if I don't like the genre ? I want to know what this is about !"". It's true that this movie is not for everyone, and I can understand that some people will strongly dislike it. Well, just know that if you appreciate the kind of movies John Carpenter was delivering in the 80's, this is for you. Now go !Personnaly, I absolutely loved The Void, it has been a very long time since I felt so much tension while watching a film. The buildup is very well done. This is no ""jump in your seat"" crap. It is the kind of movie that makes you hold your breath and make your blood pressure go up, the kind that makes you feel like you are in a nightmare. The Void will get the same kind of cult status as movies like Event Horizon or In the Mouth of Madness did.",positive

Colossal,"--- Spoilers below (I guess?) ---I continued watching this with the hopes that it would eventually make sense and turn out to be a good movie.I was wrong.The characters all had unrealistic psychotic tendencies that weren't funny or even shocking -- it was just bad. Don't get me wrong, I think the actors made the best out of the crap they were handed, but the awful dialog followed by sudden dark character twists reminded me of watching bad improv comedy that bombs on every attempt at a joke.If you watched the trailer then you saw most of the scenes with the monsters already. The rest is really odd character development that drags on for an uncomfortable amount of time.Don't waste your time on this one.",negative
Colossal,"This is not the movie it was advertised to be. Or the synopsis portrays it as. It is amazing, but it is not a comedy.This is a movie about stalking and domestic violence and the hatred that some men have towards the women they want to control and can't.

Spring,"Have you ever seen a movie that is at the same time romantic drama, comedy, sci-fi and a horror movie with some historical elements? Spring is not a drama with other genre *elements*. This movie is at the same time all of the above. Now that's a crazy combination! Spring takes things slowly. It is not fast paced horror movie primarily focused on delivering terror and creeps. Scary scenes are nicely distributed through the whole movie. In between them we enjoy romantic moments. Historical elements play a really important role in delivering the last few key moments. I found this movie pretty funny. Comedy is not by itself obvious (even though the main premise is pretty hilarious when you think about it); those having a peculiar sense of humor will surely appreciate ""hidden"" humor. Just look at a few quotes on IMDb page.When I first had seen the movie I gave it a six. Now I give it an eight. This is one of the most original screen pieces I've ever seen. Different genres are balanced very finely.Spring is going to disturb you, make you laugh and most importantly make you think about what gives life a meaning. Is it really important how long one lives? And the final scene? It gives meaning to the whole movie and provokes answers to existential questions. Just wait till you see it!",negative
Spring,"A hidden gem and easily one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The acting, writing and directing are all seamless.I admit there were moments, such as when our poor protagonist reacts to the truth about his girlfriend, which stretched the bounds of plausibility, but aside from those few scenes the film was incredibly real and fresh throughout.The film's brand of dry, intelligent humor was a lovely surprise. I buckled in for a thriller and found myself laughing many times instead. I also highly commend the snippets of philosophy, morality, mortality, religion and science which were sprinkled throughout the film and delivered with just the right amount of wit and depth by both actors. It really is a wonderful blend of romance and sci-fi, and this is coming from someone who loves sci-fi and has a pathological fear of chick flicks. I highly recommend it.",positive
PK,"I did not feel offended by any of the things related to god.Everyone has a perspective of looking at a religion there is nothing right or wrong in that.My main concern was the movie as a whole.It felt as if this movie was made to give a Tribute to Aamir Khan.For example Boman Irani is such a great actor but he was only like a prop in the film. There was nothing in the movie which touched by heart as a whole unlike other films of Rajkumar Hirani which kept me thinking about it even after going out of the movie theater.There were some scenes which were irritating and not even funny and were just put to show the whole world of why Aamir khan is such a great actor.The songs were like children's poem.I just want to tell everyone that don't blindly appreciate whatever he does,he is not always right and perfect.If this movie was made with a new comer it surely would have bombed at the box office.The movie didn't have a particular story to keep you edged at the seats,things just kept happening with a few laughs here and there.There are so much better movies made which don't get that appreciation because of the small star cast and low marketing.",negative
PK,"To make this short and quick, PK is a movie which includes drama and comedy. It focuses on a very serious topic using those two categories to further advance the plot. I recommend this movie for anyone who has watched any other movies of Rajkumar Hirani's, as well as to any one who finds satirical comedies interesting to watch. Once you watch the movie for yourself you might agree with me, that the movie delivers on what it has to offer.",positive
Dark Skies,"Scott Stewart's work is really lacking in execution to me. Legion and Priest were both really nice concepts but they were not brought to life in a way that captured or kept my attention, or rather, just as Dark Skies, they left much to be desired. In this film, we avoid the dreadful build-up and anxiety, and we jump straight into the oddities, which is a great thing as most of the screen time in other sci-fi films is taken up be long-winded scientific explanations that turn out to be false. Another good thing is that this film isn't about some made-up conspiracy that's hard to swallow, no, it's a documented experience many Americans have had, and something the US Government is had has been heavily involved in...so there's a great reality factor there. But, this film is lacking something, just as all his work is lacking in some area. The acting is solid, the story is okay, but something is missing.Perhaps it's the patchwork revelation of ""the signs were right in front of you,"" and ""you should've known all along."" Or maybe its the fact that he employed a series of mini-flashbacks to explain the ending...which leads one to believe that his plot development was off a little. I think what was really missing was any real conflict. Yeah, that's it. There was no solid, actual conflict. The encounters, the actual climax, none of that presented any real tension or suspense or just plain old conflict. I liked this movie and I don't think I wasted my time by watching it. Nope. I enjoyed it. I just wouldn't watch it often.",negative
Dark Skies,"Can a science fiction film be given the horror treatment? This isn't something new, like The Fourth Kind, but unlike that film, this one is truly terrifying, especially when you least expect it to be. Granted its credits never fail to remind you that the producers here were also behind Paranormal Activity and Insidious, but look hard for that ghoul set to spook, and you'll never find it. Instead it deals with alien abduction, and boy, has it never been delivered this good, and scary.Written and directed by Scott Stewart, this is a definite improvement from his earlier efforts with Legion and Priest. Dark Skies lulls you into some complacency, introducing the audience to the Barrett family, who may seem like the typical all American one living in the suburbs, where dad Daniel (Josh Hamilton) is in between jobs, and mom Lacy (Keri Russell) supports the household for the time being as a realtor to keep the mounting bills at bay. Sons Jesse (Dakota Goyo) and Sam (Kadan Rockett) are the typical teenager and toddler growing up, with a little bit more focus on the former as he hangs out with relative geek company, and is on his first romantic brush with the daughter of his mom's best friend.Then things start to go all strange, and at times begin to feel like Paranormal Activity in treatment for just a bit. Lacy finds herself inexplicably waking up in the middle of the night to encounter things like having her fridge raided by someone unknown, or seeing her kitchen wares and containers stacked in a geometric pattern. These are the more benign encounters, until flocks of migrating birds start to violently converge at their house, and each family member start to behave as if possessed, losing track of time, and being subconsciously unaware during their awake hours. Worse, they also seem to bear the marks of physical harm, and it's not long after that CCTV cameras got placed around the house.But no, we're not given any found footage treatment or first person perspective, because that would be pushing the envelope of familiarity. Instead, Dark Skies relies on good old fashioned storytelling, with a fair bit of conventional devices, techniques and styles to amplify key moments in the narrative that will make you cringe at your seat, or be tightly grabbing onto that armrest when Stewart deftly builds suspense. The horror imagery got strongly built into carefully crafted scenes, which made this many times more effective than the average horror film that had blood, gore and makeup as part of its arsenal, something conspicuously absent in Dark Skies, but demonstrating that it could do a lot more with less.The narrative was kept simple enough to revolve only around a handful of characters, and firmly around the family that allows it to be easily identifiable under a What If scenario, while building one's affiliation with them as they seem nice enough not to be suffering under such inexplicable terms. But what worked wonders here are the technical aspects, from its steady cinematography which is minus all the trappings of badly formed habits that would have made this a blur to follow, and solid editing that instills fear especially when transitioning between lost time. What stood out will be the brilliant sound design of course, adding that layer to bring that shiver down your spine. Watching this with the volume turned off would have neutered the film, and that's testament to how important, and effective this aspect was to the movie.The finale is set to ruff a few feathers, although it may be a stretch to suggest that there would be doors left open for a follow up film. The cast delivered top performances, augmented by technical competency to make this the perfect blend of science fiction with horror sensibilities that puts many contemporary horror films of late to shame. A definite recommendation if you're looking for that heart-thumping thrill ride that's lacking in recent times for the genre fans.",positive
IO,"I forced myself to finish this movie in order to feel okay about writing a review; however, I really wanted to step away after the first major factual inaccuracies presented themselves in the first 5 minutes. As an environmental engineer, I feel more than qualified to comment on these inaccuracies. I'll outline several of them from throughout the movie for you here:1) ""... to harvest geothermal energy from other planets."" (00:01:20)
The prefix ""geo"" is defined as ""relating to the Earth""; therefore, ""geothermal energy"" refers exclusively to thermal energy from the Earth. You cannot ""harvest geothermal energy from other planets"" anymore than you can harvest solar energy from a lightbulb.2) ""Sample 181B. Drawn from the sediment strata, should confirm or disconfirm the presence of bacterium able to use ammonium as a main oxygen source."" (00:04:46)
This quote contains two errors, so I will refer to them as ""2a"" and ""2b"".
2a) Ammonium consists of only Nitrogen and Hydrogen, so it could never be a ""main oxygen source"". In the unlikely case that by ""ammonium"" the writers were implying ""ammonium oxide"", it would be within the realms of a science fiction piece to make this claim. However, the fact that this is an isolated use of the term ""ammonium"" in the movie (the writers prefer ""ammonia"" in every other case, which actually is a different chemical compound), along with a later inaccuracy I will address, make the loose inference of ""ammonium"" to ""ammonium oxide"" very unlikely. What's more is that it is not a new concept that bacteria exist which can respire in such conditions. In fact, we have known that they exist for a long time and rely on them in many ways. I will mention this later on as well.
2b) In this quote, the singular ""bacterium"" is used in the plural sense. It's interesting that the writers were even familiar with the singular form when ""bacteria"" is colloquially used in the singular sense, and ""bacterium"" is almost exclusive to scientific literature and dialogue where it is always used in reference to a single bacterium or singular strain of bacteria. Later in the movie, another character makes the opposite but more forgivable mistake when he says, ""Was it a bacteria?"" (01:15:46)3) ""Anaerobic reproduction in a water-striding insect colony."" (00:08:56)
To my knowledge, there is no such phenomenon referred to as ""anaerobic reproduction"". That is not to say that this is impossible or does not exist. Let me explain. Anaerobic simply refers to processes which occur in the absence of a common electron accepter (e.g., nitrate, sulfate, or oxygen). Many organisms, such as anaerobic bacteria, do in fact reproduce in these conditions. However, this is not referred to as ""anaerobic reproduction"" because neither anaerobic nor aerobic conditions lend themselves to a specific type of reproduction. More than likely, the writers actually meant ""anaerobic respiration"". This makes sense in light of the ""scientific"" premise of the movie, which is the struggle of life on earth to adapt to an atmosphere contaminated with ammonia and implicitly low oxygen. The reference to anaerobic conditions also discredits the notion that the writers implied ""ammonium oxide"" when using the term ""ammonium"".4) ""We filter our drinking water through sand and charcoal. It's all it needs."" (00:26:55)
Assuming the water is contaminated with ammonia (like the air), sand and charcoal would do nothing to purify it. In wastewater treatment, where ammonia removal is a necessary process, nitrifying bacteria are used to nitrify ammonia. That is, they ultimately convert the ammonia to nitrate, hydrogen and water. This is a very complicated, multi-step process that involves balancing pH, dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen demand to achieve the desired effect. Had the writers suggested that Sam harvested nitrifying bacteria (likely quite common on an ammonia-rich Earth) and used them to treat her water, this would have been within the realms of a science fiction piece. But sand and charcoal would do nothing for ammonia.5) ""It's only cloudy like that because of the charcoal."" (00:26:49)
Charcoal filtration removes particles from contaminated water through adsorption. Most household filters use activated charcoal to improve the aesthetic qualities of their water (look, taste and smell). Implying that the charcoal would actually discolor the water is a major inaccuracy, since it would in fact do the opposite. Now, if the process actually added charcoal to the water instead of filtering the water through the charcoal, this would discolor it, but it would do nothing to filter the water. However, I doubt that is the implication when the ""treated"" water has a light brown hue. Charcoal would have turned the water gray or black, depending on the amount added.6) ""You'd think they could live up high like us."" (00:30:27)
This quote implies that the surviving humans were able to escape the contaminated air by living at a higher elevation. However, ammonia is lighter than air, meaning the ammonia concentration would likely be higher at an increased elevation, not lower.7) Throughout the movie, Sam regularly monitors the air quality by sustaining a flame and observing its color. In the movie, a purple flame is supposed to represent contaminated air, whereas a yellow/orange flame represents clean air. When ammonia burns in the presence of oxygen, the flame is actually yellow, not purple. But let's look at this a little deeper. Ammonia has a flammable range of 15 - 28%. This means that ammonia will not ignite at a concentration of less than 15% volume of air or a concentration higher than 28% volume of air. According to the CDC, ammonia is ""immediately dangerous to life or health"" at just 300 ppm, which is just 0.03% volume of air. A concentration of 15% (150,000 ppm) or higher would not just be damaging to the eyes, nostrils and lungs, but also to the skin. The character would need to wear a fully-enclosed, airtight suit to protect herself against harm.I understand that science fiction writers are not scientists, but the premise behind science fiction is to provide a somewhat plausible scenario that is at least loosely based on some scientific truth. Even fantasy pieces, which delve into realms far beyond the scope of even pseudoscience, do not attempt to rewrite or misrepresent well-known, established scientific fact without some sort of explanation (even if it's something as ludicrous as dolphins that suddenly bound from the ocean into deep space because of their sentience and connections to other-worldly beings).It's quite disappointing to think that so much money and effort could be put into a movie on the part of writers, producers, actors, videographers, and visual effects specialists (to name a few) and yet they didn't think to have somebody with at least the qualifications of a middle school science teacher read over the screenplay.",negative
IO,"I really enjoyed the slow pace and contemplative mood of this movie. If you don't necessarily need any starship battles, aliens or futuristic tech stuff in a sci-fi movie and you appreciate characters that don't fit the usual hollywood template for that genre I'd highly recommend you give this a try!",positive
Freaks of Nature,"Some movies have so many talented people working on them that a Movie Fan can't help but take notice. Take the horror-comedy ""Freaks of Nature"" (R, 1:32) for example. For starters, its screenplay was written by Oren Uziel who wrote ""22 Jump Street"", a rare sequel that was as good as the original, if not better. Then there's the cast: Denis Leary has voiced characters in ""A Bug's Life"" and the ""Ice Age"" movies, been a supporting player in the 2012 and 2014 ""Spider-Man"" films and starred in the TV series ""Rescue Me"" on FX. Joan Cusack has a similar resume, which she has been building since 1980. Ed Westwick starred on TV's ""Gossip Girl"" and ""Wicked City"" and played roles in movies such as ""Children of Men"" and ""Romeo & Juliet"". Vanessa Hudgens was a Disney kid in the ""High School Musical"" trilogy and then graduated to more adult roles in ""Spring Breakers"" and ""Machete Kills"". Bob Odenkirk is a comedian who made a name for himself as the morally ambiguous lawyer in ""Breaking Bad"" and ""Better Call Saul"". Keegan-Michael Key is known mainly for his comedic work on TV, but began appearing in multiple movies per year starting in 2010. Mae Whitman well, you get the point. And in this movie, the relative unknowns at least look like movie stars. Nicholas Braun resembles a young Jim Caviezel, Mackenzie Davis made me imagine a taller Zooey Deschanel and Josh Fadem calls to mind one of the Coreys from the 80s (although I still can't tell my Feldman from my Haim). You would think those kind of looks and that kind of talent and experience would practically guarantee a good movie. You would think.""Freaks of Nature"" takes place in the fictional town of Dillford, Ohio (""The Home of the Riblet""), where humans, vampires and zombies live in relative harmony. Key plays a high school teacher who, as a vampire, has been at the school for 97 years, and he's sick of it – every bit of it. Westwick also plays a vampire, but one who (type-casting alert) uses people for his own selfish goals! Whitman's character plays a zombie who makes zombie life look and sound more pleasant than you'd expect. Leary is a self-made (human) man who started the riblet plant which put the town on the map – and he never lets anyone forget it! Hudgens' character smokes marijuana (a lot) and uses a classmate's house as a place to hide her stash. Cusack and Odenkirk (also human) are the hippie parents of Braun's character, Dag Parker. Two of Dag's classmates, the pretty but insecure Petra (Mackenzie) and the brainy outcast Ned (Fadem) decide to become a vampire and a zombie, respectively, which means that Dag is now friends with a girl who wants to drink his blood and a guy who wants to eat his brains. Well, maybe ""friends"" isn't the best word to describe their relationship. In this small town, these three have known each other their whole lives, but aren't as close as they might have been as kids. Circumstances force all three to get reacquainted, but fast. Their lives, and possibly the lives of everyone in their town depend on it.The uneasy peace amongst the mortals and the undead is shattered by an alien apocalypse. You might think that the town's three main groups would band together in the face of a common enemy, but this alien invasion (which results in a force field being created around their town) just brings up long-held prejudices and suspicions, leading the vampires, humans and zombies to start fighting and killing each other. Dag, Petra and Ned find themselves in a situation that provides them temporary safety, which allows them to calm down and become level-headed enough to devise a plan to save their small town.""Freaks of Nature"" has a premise which sounds fun, but fails to deliver on that promise. Too many of the characters are unlikeable and the jokes aren't nearly as funny as in the similarly-themed ""Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"" (which, by the way, manages to be far more entertaining with far fewer well-known actors). This movie's problem isn't just that the actors and the script are uninspired, but the set-up of the story and some of its developments just don't make any sense, comedically or otherwise. For example, the zombie teens attend high school even though they lack any real language skills or intellectual abilities, the vampire teens also manage to go to school even though it's during the day (in the sunlight? hello!) and the humans (both the fictional characters and the actual filmmakers) look to be making up the rules to this brave new world as they go, with plot points that seem to come out of nowhere. This movie looks and sounds like it wants to be a modern version of a 1980s-style B-movie, but that's too lofty a goal for this underachiever. Some viewers may enjoy the film's aimless quirkiness, but that would take more effort than this movie deserves, in spite of its accomplished cast. ""D+""",negative

The Discovery,"When the scientist Thomas Harbor (Robert Redford) proves the existence of afterlife, there is a massive wave of suicides on Earth. On the second anniversary of his discovery, his estranged son Will (Jason Segel) travels on a ferry to the island where his father lives. He meets Isla (Rooney Mara), a troubled woman that lost her five-year son, and they have a conversation; then they say goodbye to each other on the arrival. Will's brother Toby (Jesse Plemons) drives him to Thomas's real estate, indeed a colony for troubled people that attempted to suicide. Thomas discloses that he has developed a machine to record what dead people see in the afterlife. When Will walks on the beach, he sees Isla trying to commit suicide, but he saves and brings Isla to his father's house. Soon they fall in love for each other and Will shows her that his father's machine works. But when Isla is murdered by an insane resident, Will uses the machine expecting to meet her in the afterlife. Will he be well succeeded? ""The Discovery"" is a romance with an original story and a missed opportunity of making a great film. The performances are top-notch but the screenplay is messy and boring. The idea of spiritual planes in the afterlife and the consequences of the scientific discovery of the afterlife is fascinating and deserved a better screenplay. The final twist is totally unexpected. My vote is five.Title (Brazil):"" The Discovery""",negative
The Discovery,"The movie starts off with an intriguing premise, the scientific discovery of the afterlife. Good cast, should be a decent story... what could go wrong? Well, I guess a lot could.Nice seeing Redford in a film, some of the supporting cast is fine, but Mara seems miscast, and her 'leading man' has the personality of a house plant. Zero chemistry between them, and at no point do you really find their romance believable. It's difficult to figure out why the filmmakers basically decided to make the film into a love story between such boring characters when the simple premise of the film is much more interesting. Mara apparently can play just one type of character, which we see in every single film she is in -- the sullen girl. And she's paired up with the least curious, least interesting, scientist in the world. Will (her love interest) seems to sleepwalk through the movie with a pained looked on his face, like he has a nail in his shoe or he simply doesn't want to be in the film.Meanwhile they have Redford, supposedly the most important discovery in the history of humanity, and they end up with a looping love story more reminiscent of Sisyphus than anything else.Anyway, the science of course is hokum, but there are several large plot holes. Like giant gaping craters. Afterlife proved incontrovertibly would seem to imply peer review and other scientists being involved. Then why does the film act like Redford's character alone can do this research? Why do they pretend like if he hides his findings it will even matter? Surely someone else in the World is doing this same research.Instead of tackling the subject head on, the film veers off into little adventures, like finding a corpse -- which of course is a great opportunity for our lovebirds to bond.After a weak middle, the film takes a turn into stupid, with our previously never-curious scientist doing the death dance himself. This results in a final explanation of how the afterlife works ... which feels like the film ran out of ideas and wanted to wrap things up real quick.Personally I would have preferred they simply went with the idea that the research was flawed, humans look for meaning and patterns where there are none, and that Redford's character was responsible for millions of deaths. Not exactly a crowd-pleasing ending, but it's better than what they came up with.",positive
High-Rise,"A nice idea gone awfully wrong. The first 20 minutes are actually quite good: the art design is worthy of all the prizes you could award it, and the director builds a growing tension that keeps you interested, although you already know, from the first five minutes, that the likely outcome is that everything will fall apart, since ""the building"" is clearly a metaphor for ""modern"" society. However, even predictable plots can be interesting, and initially this seems to be the case.Then, the film loses its grip and very quickly becomes an endless repetition of chaos. By the 30min mark the director has made his point: society sucks and if things continue as they are, we will all descend into primitive behaviour and act like barbarians. Nothing wrong with that message per se, but the film gets stuck on it like a broken record and treats the audience to an endless stream of pointless violence, mindless sex orgies, rapes, more violence, looting, social chaos, still more violence. It's like beating a dead horse and then continuing to beat it until you are beating the skeleton of a dead horse (and you continue beating it).It seems that the writer and director were so in love with the core message that they could not quite get around to developing it and finishing it properly.I saw this at a cinema in London; some people left half-way into it (most seats were empty anyway). I managed to sit through the whole thing, hoping that the movie would redeem itself towards the end; it only got worse. This might be at the top of my ""worst films of all time"" list.The acting is not bad, the cast is good, and the art design is still deserving awards; but the overall result is just appalling. It would have made a great short film, if they stopped it at 30 minutes. The way it was released, at 119 minutes, it is 90 minutes too long.",negative
High-Rise,"My first taste of this year's BFI London Film Festival was Ben Wheatley's High-Rise, a film based on the 1975 novel of the same name by J.G. Ballard. High-Rise is one of the more bizarre films you could wish to see but its perfect blend of out-there characters and devilish humour make it one of the most mesmerising films of the last few years.In 1975 London, Dr Robert Laing (Tom Hiddleston) is a young doctor seduced by the lifestyle in a high-rise, created by Anthony Royal (Jeremy Irons) as an isolated community cut off from the rest of society.Laing meets many of the high-rise's residents and soon realises that normality isn't something easy to find on any of the floors. One of the residents, Richard Wilder (Luke Evans), who works as a documentary filmmaker, takes it upon himself to expose the class injustices that come as a way of life in the high-rise, causing a dangerous social situation to arise and social groups breaking up into violent tribes.Believe it or not, High-Rise is the first Ben Wheatley film I have seen however, if this is anything to go by, I will need to check out the rest of his filmography right away. Wheatley has that rare quality as a filmmaker to make a film feel unique within its genre, with High- Rise being quite unlike many thrillers I've ever seen.The film is brilliantly written by Amy Jump, a long time collaborator with Wheatley, with the twisted characters clashing throughout with the equally twisted screenplay devilishly weaving its way from floor to floor. The social commentary that both the book and film delves into regarding the developments in technology warping the human psyche is such an interesting aspect of the story and one that resonates very loud and clear in today's world.The performances in High-Rise play a massive part in making it such an engrossing watch. Each and every one of the actors delves right into the psyche of their respective character and look like they're having an absolute blast taking them on such a downward spiral. Tom Hiddleston just oozes class and yet again delivers a fine performance, though for me, the most impressive performance comes from Luke Evans as the mentally tortured Wilder. The film is also shot incredibly well, with Mark Tildesley's production design being brought to life through some wonderful cinematography from another long time collaborator with Wheatley, Laurie Rose. Clint Mansell's menacing score really does bring that sense of impending chaos to the fore and accompanies the film's visuals very effectively.Of course, with any film as bonkers as High-Rise, comes the chance that audiences may feel alienated from the plot and characters however, if you are willing to switch your mind to escape mode, High-Rise may prove as captivating to you as it was to me.",positive
Z for Zachariah,I love the book. I read it a dozen times a year. It's my favorite. When I heard they were making a movie I was super excited. Less than 5 minutes in I could tell the movie had departed from the book just like the space shuttle departs earth.It's almost like they had filmed the hobbit in downtown New York City.I struggled to keep watching until the third person came in. It was too much to bare.The disc and the box are now at the bottom of my garbage bin. It's not even worthy of being in the recycle bin.Don't buy this movie. It's garbage.,negative
Z for Zachariah,"Z for Zachariah is a parable of postlapsarian loss. In a verdant valley miraculously saved from a nuclear apocalypse a young woman and her dog are joined first by a black engineer and then by a young white miner. Together they convert the girl's father's church into a water wheel that will use a radioactive waterfall to generate electricity. The wood from the church will help them rebuild human society. But the new world perpetuates the tensions of the old, including romantic emotions and racial tension.The radioactive water points to mankind's corruption of the source of life, the poisoning of purity. Indeed director Craig Zobel converts a survival novel into a religious drama by adding a character to the original two-person novel and developing the religious imagery. The title recalls a book that engineer John Loomis takes off a shelf: A is for Adam. The film dramatizes the end of that Biblical story, replaying the myth of Eden after the apocalypse. Zachariah is the prophet murdered between the temple and the altar, the last of the killed prophets, so the name embodies the new narrative as a whole.The heroine Ann Burden carries the burden of innocence and faith when she struggles alone with her dog to survive. When she finds engineer John bathing in a radioactive pool she nurses him back to life. They develop a relationship of respect and interdependence. Drunk on beer, Loomis briefly confronts Ann with his vulgar carnality from which he retreats apologetic. Through the sacrament of wine Ann approaches John on her own terms and invites an intimate relationship. But John retreats, desiring her closeness but fearing the change that a sexual relationship would make. He's inhibited by both their age and their colour difference. The scene in which Ann comes to him and he embraces her with a tender self-denial expresses the desire for a deep connection through the body but not carnal.The serpent in Eden — added to the source novel — is young white Caleb, whose ""Mr Loomis"" is a condescending formality by which he insinuates himself between his two hosts. The scene in which Ann chooses Caleb over John begins with their excessive use of wine, non-sacramental, and another baptism parody when the three cavort in the water. John is finally moved to confess his love to Ann, but when she comes to him he's drunk and unconscious. She surrenders her purity to Caleb instead, waiting when he comes out of the shower. This scene parallels her finding John under a waterfall and parodies their truer love scene, a literal purification parodying the authentic. Margot Robbie marvelously suggests her character's transition from Innocence to Experience. After Caleb, her eyes are darker, more knowing, her carriage heavier under the burden of experience, and we know she cannot revert to her earlier self, nor to her earlier relationship. In the last scene she plays a dirge on the church organ while John sits earnestly listening, his hands clasped in prayer as if in futile hope to recover what he had with her pre-Caleb. But you can't recover a lost Eden. After sampling the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil innocence is gone. One by one the male figures drop out of Ann's life. We see less of her dog after John appears and nothing at all with the arrival of Caleb. Caleb — named after one of Moses's advance spies who encouraged the invasion of Canaan — becomes the animal figure in Ann's life despite his pretence at being her fellow-believer, in contrast to the agnostic John. After losing Ann John arranges for Caleb's disappearance. But he can't erase the change Caleb wrought upon Ann.",positive
If I Stay,"When I first saw the trailer for If I Stay back in April, I got chills and it quickly became one of my top five most anticipated movies of the summer. From then on, I stayed away from all other trailers and clips so that I could see the movie knowing as little as possible, to the point where I'd put the TV spots on mute and run out of the theater when a trailer came on. Based on the trailer I saw, I honestly expected something similar to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, or a dramatic Inception. However, after having finally seen it this weekend, I am sad to report that If I Stay is nothing like that at all, and is instead probably my most disappointing movie of the summer.If I Stay follows Mia, played by Chloe Grace Moretz, an 18 year old girl who likes classical music and cello, and who's still not quite over her ex, Adam (Jamie Blackley). Then on a snowy day, her life is completely turned upside down when her family and she get into a deadly car crash, sending her into a coma. In this coma, she has an out of body experience in which she needs to decides either to die and go up to heaven or live with the physical and emotional repercussions, all while flashing back to the relationship she and Adam had.The movie is primarily made up of flashbacks to the relationship that Mia and Adam had, and the chemistry that the two of them share isn't very strong and can be described as okay at best. Chloe Grace Moretz is a talented young actress who really gives it her best in this film, whereas her costar Jamie Blackley ranges from decent to mediocre. The relationship between their two characters is cute and sort of fun for the first half of the movie. However, in the second half when their relationship slowly starts to go downhill, Adam becomes a jerk and is unlikeable and unreasonable, which made me have a tough time feeling bad for him when he was an emotional wreck. Also, with Adam and Mia's relationship, something felt missing. Rather than true love, it felt like a typical high school relationship where the two people think they're love, then someday breakup and later realize that they never actually were in love.Then all the other characters are either annoying or underdeveloped. Mia's parents are somewhat likable, however, most of their jokes and dialogue come off as either flat or cringe-worthy. Then there's this couple who is close friends to Mia's parents, and they are present in the hospital for most of the movie and in many of the flashbacks. In one scene they talk about never wanting to have children, but then they are later seen in another scene with a baby (referred to as their son) who is then never referenced or seen again afterwards. The one exception to all this would be Mia's grandfather, played by Stacy Keach, and he had one scene in particular that I did really like (those who have seen the movie can probably guess what scene it was). Perhaps I am just being biased since I do enjoy Keach and his acting, but I do think he gave a good performance.Now I have some things to say regarding the ending. I'm not going to outright say any spoilers, but I'm kind of going to imply what happens in the end. Therefore, if you do not want anything spoiled about If I Stay, skip this next paragraph.Mia makes her decision to stay or leave based off of a five minute speech that one character makes to her, and then the movie ties itself up really nice in a bow and leaves everything real hopeful and bright for the characters. While I do like happy endings, I felt in this case a less hopeful ending would have been better suited to really make her decision difficult. Not Requiem For a Dream level hopeless, but rather cutting the whipped cream and cherry on top. However, I do have to say that with the route they chose, the last ten seconds of the film were perfect. The place where the last shot cut could not have been better.In the end, If I Stay is just another average teen romance movie, and it's not even all that interesting. The trailer makes the movie seem like a tear-jerking drama that takes place all in her mind about her decision to live or die, when in reality, it's a high school love story consisting of 70% flashbacks that only spends a small portion with her out of body experience. I REALLY don't want to give this movie anything below a 6/10 because of how much I had been looking forward to it for so long, but I have to give it a 5/10. It's even possible that in the future my score will go even lower. While it is somewhat entertaining, If I Stay is a rather weak romance movie for teens and is overall very forgettable.",negative
If I Stay,"Anyone interested in this film already knows the premise by now if they have read this far, so I won't rehash it.All I will say is that this film could have easily been contrived and cheesy and hokey and clichéd but rather, the end is result is truly one of the finest, most real representations of youth and love I have seen in a long time. And the fact that it seemed so genuine is exactly why I have not cried in a film so much since....""The Perks of Being a Wallflower."" Chloe Grace Moretz has already proved she is a force to be reckoned with, but by an accomplishment like playing the key character in a film that was made to be a tearjerker without coming across as completely laughable shows what a strong actress this young woman truly is.Excellent, relatable script, wonderful direction and perfectly edited, the fact the a bunch of tween girls went ""Huh? What? That's the end?"" when the credits began to roll proved that R.J. Cutler knew exactly when to end this film at the precise moment. There was no need to overstay the welcome.Make sure you have some Kleenex.",positive
The Purge: Election Year,"This film was god awful. I expected it to be at least a little entertaining but its not. The trailer for the film pretty much spoils the entire movie. The acting is the equivalent to a pornography film and the cinematography is beyond terrible. It's a cliché cash grab that is not worth the money to see in theaters or buy on blue-ray. I even found myself laughing at how bad some of the scenes in this film are, specifically the ending where the whole thing is predictable. Hell even in the second act of the film, they introduce these ""Candy Bar"" girls who not even kidding try to kill a main character for a candy bar. The script is lazy and not engaging in any way. The tension completely drops as you realize the protagonists will always find a convenient way out of a bad situation. Deus ex Machina. Do not see this film unless you want to have a laugh with a couple of friends over how bad it is. It's really not a good movie.",negative
The Purge: Election Year,This movie is similar to anarchy but improves on some stuff to make it better. I like how it shows that the rebels (what i call them because i have no idea what they're called) are becoming more and more like the purge which in the end redeems them to not be like the purge they want to destroy. The pacing can be kinda bad and sometimes its hard to determine if this movie has a main villain or not. I like how the masks are mostly based on actual people which makes it feel more realistic and colorful instead of blank basic masks. The action here is pretty good. I also think it's a bit ridiculous with the huge year gap which is pretty unrealistic with the characters looking the same that it would be better if it left that out as it wouldn't change anything at all.,positive
Turbo,"Just because there is a wealth of animated feature films out there does in no way mean all of them are worthy of our hard-earned bucks. Only a few are exceptional, a few more are decent, while most just float on the surface of pop culture for a few weeks as a true homage to mediocrity.The newest DreamWorks Animation production, ""Turbo,"" directed by David Soren (""Madly Madagascar""), fits neatly into this category.A paper-thin plot, but with enough vivid visuals and over-the-top action to distract the little ones during its 96-minute running time, Turbo is decent family fare — if the adults in that family are not asking very much to challenge their intellect or arouse their interest.I suppose I could be more positive, however, and describe this picture as the ""Citizen Kane"" of movies in which a cartoon garden snail dreams of racing in the Indianapolis 500, but I will skip the hyperbole and just write that this storyline, while patently ridiculous, has been done — in other forms — many times before.Poor, poor Turbo (voiced by Ryan Reynolds, ""Safe House""), a snail who hopes for much more in life and strives to be fast. But alas, like most of his species he is burdened with a lack of speed and is hampered with a big brother, Chet (voiced by Paul Giamatti, ""Rock of Ages""), who just doesn't understand his wishes.One night, however, after breaking a television set and visiting a highway overpass, Turbo is sucked into an engine and overdoses on nitrous oxide. His dream of being the swiftest snail alive has come true.Infused with such speed, he is able to save Chet from a murder of crows, but also peaks the interest of Tito (voiced by Michael Peña, ""Gangster Squad""), a truck driver and taco salesman whose hobby is snail races (yes, just repeat that line a few more times and let it sink in . . .).As he uses his mutation to defeat others in this enterprise, including Whiplash (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson, ""Django Unchained""), Angelo (voiced by Luis Guzmán, ""The Last Stand"") and Smoove Move (voiced by Snoop Dogg, ""Old School""), Turbo somehow communicates to Tito how much he wants to enter the Indianapolis 500 (even though that is a race for automobiles and he, of course, is a well, you know, not an automobile).In an attempt to cash in on his popularity, if not his ubiquity, Turbo also features Ken Jeong (""The Hangover Part 3,"" among several hundred other movies this year) as the voice of an old Korean lady friend of Tito's who puts smug human drivers in their place. How DARE they not accept a shelled terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk into their midst? How it concludes is no secret, nor is the fact that this effort does not nearly rise to the level of ""Despicable Me 2,"" or ""Monsters University."" Not even a healthy dose of an extra special 3D treatment adds to the enjoyment of this production (so save your money). There is an upside, however.After viewing this with your children, you can always save the experience for that one day when you can say in a guilt trip situation, ""Look what I've done for you kids, I took you to see Turbo and stayed with you the whole time.""",negative
Turbo,"At glance, there's already a sense that Turbo suffers of being unoriginal. It is yet another ""inspirational"" film of an underdog trying to make his impossible dream come true, and the fact that the concept is about a snail wishing to be as fast as a race car, it's obvious that it's trying to resemble with Ratatouille. In execution, Turbo results differently. It's shallow when it's trying to be inspiring, but there's another message that can be much interesting than the iteration. Turbo is never ought to break some grounds nor bring any powerful drama, but it has its unique charm and humor that people may adore.Turbo may not have the smartest idea, but it tells a somehow compellingly fun story. It mostly makes fun of its own conceit, because seriously it does sound like a big joke. The plot itself is just basic storytelling where it simply explores around the characters and pull off some random humor. It hardly gets to show much originality. The central message in the end is pretty much too familiar in this time. Other than those generic points, it's actually a large satirical meme, where bigger fame and money mostly goes to the weirder talents. But for a good cause; the real heart(yet still a joke) comes to the fact that the people who supports Theo/Turbo would actually risk their lives taking him into the race, because his dream is probably the absolute hope for saving their businesses. The film usually plays like that, there's a point when it sounds preposterous even if it's supposed to be heartwarming. It's strange, but that is one of the charms of the film.The voices behind the characters can be too recognizable, but they're not distracting anyway. They all brought enough personalities in their animated counterparts. Although the story doesn't require any extraordinary or groundbreaking visual features, the animation still manages to display a lot of stylish spectacles. You can see them in the final race scene, the power line race, and the snails' imagination while slithering through their mini tracks. The 3D works great too, though it's not going to be too remarkable.Turbo is never destined to be the best. As long as it's as humble as its scale and as its main character, it's all good. It's kind of hard to get over the lack of originality unless you're honestly entertained throughout the experience. The real point of the movie is to present how ridiculous the world they made where it mocks on whatever nature and today's society do, yet scatter some thematically endearing subplots. Besides, this is from Dreamworks. They are usually known for pop culture references and inevitable slapstick humor, but here they used those elements in a smarter way. The film still has the heart that good animated movies have and when it goes there, it tends to be sweeter.

The First Purge,"Loved the original Purge movie, but this one was just so horrible. Seriously... the big neighborhood drug dealer is the good guy hero (""Make way for the King!"") and all the white people are bad & evil. I kept hoping I was wrong, but it just kept getting more and more obvious. What's the message here? Just a movie to feed the racial divide with stereotypes all over the place. Incredibly disappointing.",negative
The First Purge,"Worst purge movie ever? Ehh no. Best purge movie ever? Definitely not. I might come off biased since this is the first purge movie I ever saw (only one I saw in theaters as well). Skeletor's acting is over the top and crazy that it makes it fun to watch him. The pacing is extremely fast in this movie and even with it being almost an hour and 40 minutes long, the purge event feels too quick. Just a reminder this movie came out about 4 or 5 months after Black Panther which shows how inspired they are to have black males as the leads and factions like corrupted cops and other hate groups. At least election year being political made sense because election year got rid of the purge. This movie is only political about racism because of the time this movie came out. I wouldn't say its better than Anarchy or Election year but it is WAY better than the original (the one that came out in 2013).",positive
I Origins,"40 minutes into the movie the religion is served to you nice and warm, fresh, and ready to eat. You are told what to think, given biased views, and plenty of illogical premises, mmmm!

How can this be a religious flick?Just enjoy the show my friend... no more religion, we're so sorry.1:15:00 in, and oie, one of the lead roles suddenly believes in religion for no explainable reason other than to drive the plot, which has now crumbled, ever forward, toward Sunday school.Your choice of a Cesar's things to Caesar Salad, or an unlimited amount of Breadsticks and Fish, oui misure?Now you're forced to choose something else entirely, as after this point, the religion is thrust down your throat nearly every scene, until at 1:26:00 we're faced with a religious debate between our scientist and some lady that logically pummels him using illogical reasoning, and clearly, somehow, the music tells us that she pwns him with something that is apparently supposed to make logical sense but keep in mind this is a work of fiction.It is apparent that this moment is ""the point"" of watching the movie, because from this second on, you can practically describe every next scene in complete detail. They are just going through the motions; The scientist becomes adamantly religious, because lo and behold... science has proved religion is actually true! Love prevails! Science bad!

Brit Marling seems to choose her films very carefully, and I'm coming to suspect that anything she's involved in is going to be different, and very well done.This film is inspiring - not just because of it's content, but because of the way it's made. Hollywood can NOT make films like this. They can do a lot of things, but they can't seem to write scenes, scenarios, and certainly not dialog like this. This feels like real life, and because of this, it really effects you and draws you in. You really get to know, understand and care about the characters, in a way that just doesn't seem to happen in 'Hollyweird' films.I don't want to go into any detail about the film here. I just want to say that it is truly amazing, unpredictable, beautiful, powerful and worth your time.IMPORTANT: Be sure not to turn it off as the credits roll - there's a great little additional scene at the very end, which ads another dimension to the way the story wraps up.Truly excellence in film making.

If you've seen a lot of movies of this genre then do you really need to see 2 kids playing in one room for over an hour? The acting is like what you may get in a casting call, which us too bad because Robbie does all right in Code 8. It's Groundhog's day without the jokes and without Bill Murray. Not even sexy.

ARQ,"I'll start off by saying that this movie is an excellent thriller. It bends the rules of timelines by using time travel. This results in a series of scenes in which you genuinely have no idea what's going to happen next.The development of the movie is very fluid and the way the movie addresses plot centers allows the viewer to gradually get more involved with the characters.The movie questions multiple aspects of time travel in a fresh but familiar way, while developing strong characters.

After Earth,"This film is about a space craft that crash-landed on a dangerous planet called Earth, and the only two survivors have to struggle to stay alive.The first few minutes of ""After Earth"" already look not so promising, and it only goes downhill from there. Acting is consistently bad by Jaden Smith, he is so annoying as a teenager who constantly freaks out. Will Smith is supposed to be a fearless commander, but his supposed bravery makes him so wooden as if he was a wax statue.The plot is simply ridiculous. There are so many plot holes that are so obvious, that they simply should not happen. For example, if Will Smith is such a great commander, how could he not command people to wear seat belts when they were about to hit a meteor shower. And the masks are not even connected to anything!? The whole story, from the macro level to the micro level is very poorly written and makes no sense. The supposed emotional climax is so weak, that I wonder if that scene is really supposed to make me feel proud of what is shown on the screen.""After Earth"" is a terrible mess. This time, believe the critics.",negative
After Earth,"After Earth should be retitled After Birth, because that is exactly how sloppy and dirty this pathetic excuse for a film is. Gross analogy, I know, but trust me, a delivery room after a woman has given birth is a better produced show then this. I honestly don't even know where to start. The film decided to market itself as a Will Smith film, which was the only way to get people to go because of how silly its plot is. Even the Will Smith fans were let down because all he does is sit in a chair the whole time and speak to his son in an over-serious and unintentionally hilarious monotonous voice. He easily gives his worst performance to date, but it is not quite the worst acting in the film. Jaden Smith gives a Razzie worthy performance as an underdeveloped character with a useless upsetting past and an ear-cringing accent. He whines and makes the most stupid mistakes a film character has ever made in the history, provided by the horrendous Shamylan-Esq screenplay where you can't tell if its supposed to be funny or not. ""He let me borrow the book Moby Dick, he even let me hold it.""""Hold what?"" ""The book...dad"" Word for word. This comes off as a terrible joke some sixth grader tries to make, and there are many nonsense lines like this crammed into the ridiculous plot with gaping and obvious plot holes. Why is he making a fire when he's right above a geothermic vent? Why in the heck did the bird who just tried to eat him save his life? Why is that oxygen mask working when its not even attached to anything? Why did Jaden need to get higher on the volcano to send out the transmission when he was just getting closer to the ""radioactive cloud""(dafuq)? A ton of these mistakes are so obviously scattered throughout the terrible script. It really just makes it funny. If you enjoy being entertained by stupid movies, I definitely recommend you check this out because it is so bad its funny.GRADE: D- (The only reason I'm not giving this piece of crap an F is because it's still not as bad as Last Airbender, so you need to give Shamylan some credit)",positive
Despicable Me 2,"CAREFUL! I went to the cinema yesterday to watch this movie because I liked the first part and because I trusted in the good rating here on IMDb which was a mistake. Maybe you like Despicable Me 2, but if you are looking for a movie like Despiceable Me 1, I want you to know that THIS MOVIE IS NOT COMPARABLE TO ITS PREDECESSOR. I liked the predecessors extraordinary and impressible sense of humor - which has become damn silly in part 2. I also liked the story and its message in part 1 - which has become ordinary and cheesy in part 2.

On the other hand this film is completely memorable and so enjoyable.I saw the preview and I absolutely loved it. I was worried that all the good bits were in the adverts but the film was full of exciting and hilarious parts that aren't in the advert. The minions are so funny, I was actually crying with laughter at some parts. In fact, I enjoyed it so much I am taking my little brother to see it again (mainly so I can see it again!

Cargo,"When I saw the trailer I was a little weary about this film. I wasn't sure if it would suck like many other indie epidemic survival movies that have been released in the last 5 years. But thankfully I was not right, this film was very good and not your typical infection film. Its about a couple and their infant child dealing with the end of civilization, where a massive epidemic sweeps across the land. I found this to be less about the disease and more about the relationship between parent and child, and the parent doing absolutely anything to help there baby. This really comes through in the film, you really feel the desperation and love, that often is very intense. Very emotional and had me on the edge of my seat a few times. Not to mention the great acting that only adds to the intensity of any given scene. I've always loved Martin Freeman, another great performance from him.The cinematography is absolutely wonderfully done, and is complemented by the beautiful Australian outback. Whoever did the location scouting for this deserves more than A+. You could almost feel the heat, the thirst, the dryness. I cant describe how well the film portrays helplessness and desperation in such times as a massive epidemic, the emotions come through perfectly. I felt connected to the characters, as little as they are, and I was interested until the end of the film. I also worried it may become too slow, but even in the ""slow"" parts were interesting and kept me invested in the story and characters. I really was surprised how much I liked this film, it was a welcome change of pace from the typical Walking Dead rip-off junk.Watch it.",negative

Tau,"Psychological thrillers centered around artificial intelligence are some of my favorite movies, the genre has so much potential to explore artificial minds, as well as terrify with their capabilities. In order to do so, they require very fleshed out and smart writing, when comparing the writing of this film, especially the writing of the A.I. to that of films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Her, and Ex machina, the writing falls very short. It has a very difficult time fleshing out the protagonists relationship with the A.I., leading to many scenes that feel undeserved and forced. They wanted emotional scenes, but they didn't earn them. This on top of very mediocre performances, and character decisions that don't seem near as reasonable as some other choices they could have made. There were also a few things that weren't logical from any standpoint, but I'm willing to suspend that disbelief. I very much enjoyed the set itself, it did a good job selling itself as a futuristic film, and also made for some very pretty cinematography, using different colored lights and displays to illuminate some shots and scenes. Altogether, I liked the concept, disliked the execution.",negative

The Host,"The current score on IMDb is too low. This is a fairly good film. It's worth about a 7.5. To see the true IMDb score, click the link for the number of users and look at the bell graph. Eliminate the 1s and 10s, and you'll see that what you're left with is a solid 7.Saoirse Ronan was perfectly cast for this role as the sensitive, conflicted alien slowly gaining the trust of the human survivor group. Diane Kruger and William Hurt were also good. (Once again, I'm struck how so many Hollywood movies lately have non-American actors playing Americans. What's that all about?) ""The Host"" is part of a new genre I would call ""sci fi for chicks"". If it bothers you to see a ""soft"" science-fiction film with love-sick young people, noble suicides, impossibly handsome young men, aliens with emotions, etc., don't go see this one. It's the old male v. female dilemma: Should we kill the hated aliens or coax them out and make friends with them? There was not enough exposition at the start about the horrors of the alien invasion. The writers and producers seem to have assumed that moviegoers would understand why the characters want to ""remain human"" and why they would refer to a human-hosted alien as ""it"". Perhaps it was better explained in the book.The device of Melinda's consciousness remaining fully alert, and Wanda and Melinda actually talking to each other for our benefit, might put some moviegoers off. (I'm not sure. I haven't read the other reviews.) However, once I suspended my disbelief, I was able to go with the flow.They threw the male viewers a bone: Kruger and Ronan, to start. there were a few car and motorcycle chases (involving futuristic-looking chrome vehicles), and shoot outs. Hey, this is a Hollywood movie, after all.The theme of humans hosting aliens is not original, but they took the concept in a different direction. The movie is slick and well made, but there were a few clichés and many, many aspects of the story that were glossed over, left unexplained or just not realistic. The survivors here were mostly young Hollywood pretty boys, not a ragged group of tough survivors (like on ""Walking Dead"", for example.)Still, I appreciated some of the details of the ""good alien"" theme, like a society of honest and trustworthy aliens that doesn't need cash to function, or where they will simply give you their car if you need it, or where everyone drives at the speed limit. (God forbid we should have a society like that! Kill them!) And I liked the part where the other seekers looked at the evil seeker (played by Kruger) and pointed out that she was getting a little too obsessed. After all the aliens saw themselves as the good guys. There are many species that coexist in symbiosis. It's interesting to think that maybe it would do our species good. This is actually a very old theme. There's not much difference between ""her body has been taken over by an alien"" and ""she is filled with the Holy Spirit"", or even ""she is possessed by a demon"".",negative
The Host,"Outside of The Twilight Saga, The Host is Stephanie Meyer's biggest novel and since the success of her supernatural series, her sci-fi novel has been adapted. There is a stronger cast and director for The Host, than the Twilight Saga, but how does it fare on its own terms? In the near future, Earth has been conquered by a parasitic alien race known as The Souls, who implant themselves into human bodies. Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan) is a member of the human resistance who gets captured when she tries to protect her younger brother, Jamie (Chandler Canterbury). Melanie gets implanted with a Soul, called Wanderer, with the aliens planning to use Melanie's memories in order to find the human resistance. As Wanderer explores Melanie's memories, she finds out about Melanie's lover, Jared (Max Irons) and the pair plan an escape to the desert to find the resistance camp. Within the camp, Wanderer falls for another human, Ian (Jake Abel), causing problems for all of them.Let's get the comparisons with Twilight out the way; yes there is a is love triangle (or should that be a love square?), The Host has a much better lead actress with Ronan then Kirsten Stewart and has a stronger supporting cast, with the likes of William Hurt and Diane Kruger. Andrew Niccol also gives the film more creditability behind the camera, acting as both the writer and director. The Host has interesting ideas that had many potential avenues to explore: but unfortunately it focuses more on the love story instead of all of the other aspects that could have lead to a much more meaningful film.Ronan does rise above the material and gives very strong performance, as you would expect from her. This is even more remarkable that she has to argue and talk with herself, like Homer Simpson arguing with his own brain. Whilst there was the potential for themes of locked in syndrome as Melanie is trapped inside her own head, fighting to control her own body or going through a more literal, internal conflict. But it turns really silly when she argues with herself over two men, as opposed of having a much more difficult time of having a stronger conflict within her character. Ronan gets battered and beaten throughout the film as she gets hit, verbally abused and discriminated against and yet, still persevere through everything she's up against.Whilst Ronan does a good job, the two men she is meant to be conflicted about are blank stales. Neither actor has much of a personality or character and they are very indistinguishable from each other. Ronan has no choice but to carry the film, considering that there was nothing going for the main love interests. At least Hurt and Kruger looked like they were having fun with their roles and were highly professional with their performances.The idea of some sort of insider for an oppressive regime having an awakening, usually because a love interest and ends up turning against their own side has been used before. We have seen it in novels like Nineteen-Eighty Four, Fahrenheit 451 and We and films such as Metropolis and THX-1138. The Host does twist this age old idea in sci-fi, even if the execution was lacking.The Host had a really strong premise with opportunities to explore multiple themes. They could have been themes about identity, the battle within the mind, split personalities, trust and how humans would survive after this invasion. But like Twilight, the film only touches on these concepts and puts all of its focus in the wrong places.Much like Twilight, The Host has been criticised for its dialogue and being unintentionally funny. It is true that the film has some bad dialogue, but with some of the moments that were comical that had be intentional, with some of its moments of cultural clash and the bickering between Wanderer and Melanie. There are also some dark moments and there were really refreshing when they do come around.Niccol is known for being an excellent writer director, making Gattaca and Lord of War and was nominated for an Academy Awards for his screenplay for The Truman Show. The Host is his first adaptation and it felt very rigidly close to the source material. What it results to is a bland experience that has episodic nature, having mini-plots with some developments, instead of a larger overarching story. Looks wise, the film is pretty flat and dull, using nothing but silver chrome for the alien technology, concrete and glass for the buildings and the humans are based in an empty desert environment. The cinematography and the special effects were solid but, Niccol was coasting and he is much more capable then this.Currently on Rotten Tomatoes, The Host has an 12% rating and seemingly on course to be considered one of the worst films of 2013. Whilst it is hard to argue that The Host is a good movie, it is certainly not terrible: its crime is merely being mediocre, dull and forgettable.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",positive

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,"What on EARTH are the people who have raved about this film watching? Anything other than a co-ordinated, presumably paid, campaign of solicited positive reviews seems improbable to me.I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I loved the opening movie of this new take on the franchise for it's original and thoughtful way of kick-starting an updated 21st century imagining for the birth of sentient apes. I read Pierre Boulle's ""Monkey Planet"" in the 70's, and loved the original series of movies (even the naffer, later ones after ""escape""). This may be largely influenced by my youthful age at the time and general love of science fiction.I have no problem with the willing suspension of disbelief or escapism. A film doesn't have to make perfect sense in ""the real world"" for me to appreciate it. What i do have a huge problem with, however, is the lazy and cavalier way this movie utterly cuts loose from the premise so carefully set up in ""Rise"", and which i was intrigued to see explored further in this plot less, pointless travesty.There is so much wrong with this movie that i am simply unable to catalogue it, however, here are a few pointers.......1) it is set just 10 years after ""rise"". Yet, in this time, the West Coast of America has in the main turned into jungle. Old petrol stations are shown looking as overgrown and integrated into the greenery as various Inca ruins look today, surrounded by mature trees that tower above them.2) There is a massive population of smart apes who can use sign language, and some talking apes living in the jungle. Far more than the indigenous population of the west coast could ever explain (though only (count 'em) one Orangutang, called Maurice, in the film's only nice touch - a nod to Maurice Evans who played Dr Zaius in the original). He, at least, can also write, scribing ""Ape not kill ape"" etc on rocks, which the baby apes can presumably read??? Are you chuckling yet? In just ten short years since ""rise"", 100's of thousands of years of evolution have been spread liberally, though very unevenly, across this vast ape population, who presumably flew over to the states when they heard how cool the west coast was to hang out at these days. Though, even the apes who can't talk yet, sort of grab that extra bit of evolution needed to get a bit shouty when some ""dramatic"" piece of ""plot"" development spurs them individually on....Actually, i am losing the will to go on, since i would run up against the 1000 word limit long before i ran out of ire at the lazy, trite, inconsistent, banal, clichéd ""plot"" so i will limit myself to one more observation.3) once the apes grab automatic weapons, as they invariably must, they become instantly proficient in their use and have the supernatural ability to summon UNLIMITED AMMUNITION from the same mysterious realm that transported them all in, forged their tree dwellings and bypassed Darwin so succinctly. Plus, they get the ability to put tanks on autopilot.And i didn't even start on the humans tale.....what the hell was Gary Oldman thinking of, appearing in this pile of chimp manure. Or the overblown schmaltzy soundtrack, which ""helpfully' illustrates important emotional, or dramatic ""events"" in the film.Truly, this is an experience beyond parody. As Charlton Heston would undoubtedly have commented to the director and writers of this movie ""You maniacs! You blew it up! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell""1/10 for very fluid CGI, though in 2014 i begin to question whether this warrants any points, such is the accepted state of the art?",positive
The Signal,"Aliens with incredible technology abduct humans and relocate them to a spaceship floating in space.( dark city, cube etc)but the humans can freely escape and wonder round the ship and hide away on a completely pointless recreation of area 51(like a dad joke) then they are shot with a human handgun. when the film reveals whats going on in the last few seconds then you realise the plot was just a load of garbage taped together.A film all about appearances, but ultimately a hoax.A 4 MILLION technical showreel for the filmmaker. A film that is much less than the sum of its parts. Technically excellent, editing, cinematography, acting etc, looks like a much bigger budget. A derivative film that uses the exact same ending and premise as many other films but could have been cut in half for viewing time and edited in reverse fashion for an honest delivery. it strings you out to the end to deliver the tiny amount of substance this film contains, but its definitely technically excellent, and its this aspect that fools the sci fi hungry viewer.in the end its a stupid ripoff on numerous levels.

One advice I would give is NOT watching the WHOLE TRAILER form the movie. After 1:30 minutes it shows too much and could spoil a lot of surprises. Just trust that the first part is to make contrast with what is coming next. I loved the photography, was the best from the movie by far. The story is good, and it develops interestingly.

Home,"What baffles me more than the movie itself is the fact that there are so many ten star reviews of it on this website. Do you people like watching crap? Do you enjoy having your soul ripped from your body, mangled, then shoved back in? Are you all mad?This movie isn't the kind of blatantly bad movie that you walk out of snickering to your friends about. This is a new kind of bad; one that I have never encountered before. There is something so sinister, so manipulative about the way this story was executed that I left the theater confused and horrified.The movie starts of with our main character, Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory, talking in stupid grammar. Then he meets Rihanna, who is even worse at voice acting than he is. Badger from Breaking Bad is also in there somewhere. Steve Martin also joins this baffling cast, sporting a disturbing mustache. While the latter two did a good job with the awful lines they had to read, our two main protagonists, Sheldon and Rihanna, could not read lines naturally to save their lives.The plot was really strange; easy to follow, but strange. There was definitely something wrong with the editing, and I wouldn't be surprised if the editor wasn't even fully conscious when he was cutting and pasting the scenes together. The pacing was all over the place. The movie felt like it ended three times before it actually ended. The action scenes had no tension. The emotional scenes came out of nowhere and confused me with their weight. The jokes were forced and felt flat on their faces.The biggest and most glaring problem with this movie is the music. When they weren't playing EVERY RIHANNA SONG EVER, the movie treats us to the worst orchestral score I have ever heard in my life. Every time a song played, it felt inappropriate. The action scenes were either accompanied by bafflingly quiet Dubstep, or strangely quiet orchestral music. Every time an action scene started, the music got quieter. You don't DO that! Did the aliens IN the movie make this movie??There are so many things I want to say about the movie, so many questions about WHO made these creative decisions and WHY they are still allowed to roam freely on this earth. This was just abysmal! It's terrible! There are very small fleeting moments of genuine emotional weight, and there are a few slightly clever lines, but it's all wrapped up in a flurry of terrible jokes, and terrible music, and terrible voice acting that it's CONFUSINGLY bad. I wanted to like the main characters, I really did! And there were moments when I did feel genuine sympathy for them, only for all that sympathy to fly out the window and into space because the editor quickly cuts to a completely different scene with a very different emotional feel to it. Or a terrible Rihanna song starts playing and ruins the mood. The one good thing about the movie is the animation. I enjoyed the effect of the aliens' skin color changing based on their emotions. I liked the design of the ""evil"" aliens, for the most part. The main character girl's hair was very well rendered. The movie looked beautiful, just like a turd looks beautiful when you polish it.Overall, this movie is an absolute train wreck. It's kind of funny how Rihanna voices one of the main characters, and most of her music is featured in--WAIT A SECOND. BACK UP. BEEP BEEP BEEPRihanna plays one of the main characters and her music is featured prominently in the movie. HMMMMMMMMMMM SEEMS A BIT OF A STRANGE COINCIDENCE, DOESN'T IT???!!I digress.

I found the movie throughout entertaining and very often funny.The Boov's are just too funny in particular Steve Martin as the voice of Captain Smek, whose firm leadership of the Boov people is undermined by his ridiculous fascination with human artifacts such as bubble wrap . He reminded me partially on King Julien from the Penguins of Madagascar.But even if you are not touched by the great story you will certainly love the Soundtrack. The whole movie was perfectly set and is for me the best Dreamworks movie since a long time. Take your kids and watch it on the big screen, they will love it! and you too, guaranteed.Verdict: A great story meets perfect cast and nothing can go wrong on this alien/ human road trip movie.",positive
A Wrinkle in Time,"I ignored the bad reviews and went anyway. Disappointing is probably an understatement. This movie is a disaster. Not only is the acting incredibly awful, especially from some otherwise accomplished cast members, but the original storyline was all but abandoned. I read the book several times, and even I was confused what was going on in this film. There was no explanation for any of the concepts, character development was nonexistent, special effects were plentiful but meaningless. The most fascinating parts of the book were eliminated, or only presented so quickly that it was difficult to understand why they were happening and how they related to the story. This movie could have been SO great - there was incredible potential here, and Disney and the director literally wasted it all.",negative
A Wrinkle in Time,This movie has nothing to do with the books I enjoyed as a child. In fact it was so poorly adapted that to even call it A Wrinkle in Time is an insult to the original book. If only I could fold time and go backwards to get my 2 hours back and the $$ it cost!! Save your money and your time it's not even worth renting!,positive
Flatliners,"There's been this trend in recent years to remake iconic or at least popular movies from earlier years. For the most part these movies have been met with yawns, disinterest and have been rightfully savaged by the critics and viewers. Occasionally you get a good movie out of it but more often then not it's just a big, costly mistake. And so to get around this studios no longer refer to these movies as remakes, but ""reimaginings"". The idea is take the concept of the movie and and try different things. This still doesn't make it a good idea.The 80's version of Flatliners was an interesting movie. The concept of a group of medical students flatlining and then coming back was original. It brought with it elements of horror, existentialism and how our choices can affect both ourselves and others. This one? I struggled to find a positive to give to it and I still can't. This is a bad movie from every single point of view I can give. It follows the same story of a group of medical students who in effect kill themselves for a short period of time to see what's on the ""other side"". Then before brain damage can occur they are brought back but each brings back with them something from their past and they are in effect haunted by this. It's really the same story as the original even if it's executed in a different way. There's nothing else that needs to be said. Same thing but worse. Save your money and rent the original if you want to see this. You'll be happier and it won't cost you as much.",negative
Flatliners,"Flatliners is about a group of students who are not satisfied with their lives and thanks to the initiative of one of them (Ellen Page) they find something beyond comprehension that changes their perspectives about life. The plot itself: Promising.The movie is half sci-fi, normal people trying to surpass the limit of science in a realistic way or at least tied to the ground which cannot be said about the other part, the horror one, where the movie takes another road, a supernatural one. But is interesting in it's on way and it's very well made, in my theater people were really scared. If you're willing to accept this two sides of the movie, you're enjoying it for sure.The acting is good enough. Of course Ellen does a great job and the other actors did a good performance with what they were given.So, why the bad reviews? Well, Flatliners doesn't have the best script and it has ""teenager parts"" but who wouldn't party after that? Anyway, this is not enough for so bad reviews. So, what is it? It's the comparison with the original one. Yes, in case you don't know, this movie is a remake of a 1990 movie. And what almost everyone is doing is comparing this new one with the oldest and it's tiring. What did I do up there? Analyze the movie I went to see to the cinema. And that's it. I don't know why they insist so much on talking about other movie.Flatliners won't change your life but it's a good enough made movie, with good acting, good plot and an excellent combination of horror and sci-fi. Go see it, ignore the critics. You'll enjoy it.",positive
Beyond Skyline,"Where to start, on a high i guess at the end... It finished with a comedy blooper reel which was the only time either someone on the screen or in the room i watched it in, smiled.
After the first film you would of thought the government would of used the alien wrecks to figure something out should they attack again, nope, they go down in seconds... though after 40 mins of listening to a baby crying a smack head in the jungle figures out how to destroy them in about 30 seconds, thou not before deciphering a childs human genome in less than a minute of course. Not that the armies advance weaponry was needed as a few jit stains from the jungle managed to kill most of the aliens with a selection of small knifes.
This has just taken over Skyline as the worst sci-fi movie I've ever seen, how they got the green light for a sequel is beyond any reasonable logic, if you like those £2 Steven Segal movies you see in bins at petrol stations, then your likely to bump into this quicker than most. And if you thought it was good, you seriously need to reassess your standards... or get some in first place...",negative
Beyond Skyline,"I read some of the reviews of this and would like to say how much I disagree. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie in the theater. I really enjoy the story and effects. Maybe it does not have a completely new idea. Invaders from space have been done many times. This one is very original in its thoughts on how a superior race would accomplish this. If you just set back and enjoy it without judging every little imperfection, you will enjoy it. And I am way over twelve. I was that age when star wars first came out. Take a look and enjoy the originality and great effects. Enjoy!",positive
The House with a Clock in Its Walls,"A friend and I saw this for fun today while our kids were in school. Thank God they weren't with us! While the child in the movie is 10, the scare level is significantly older. Only later did I find out that the director actually intended it to be a ""gateway film"" into the horror genre for kids. It lived up to it! If mine had seen it I would have them sneaking into our bed for a year, or maybe forever. Parents should know that it is not like Harry Potter. This movie very definitely includes the occult, demons, and creepy dolls that attack people, among other things. If your children are at all sensitive, or for that matter, if you are, give it a miss. As for me, I may or may not be sleeping with a light on tonight and thanking my lucky stars that, as I have boys, I don't have dolls in the house!",negative
The House with a Clock in Its Walls,"Why are people saying this movie is not for kids?
I don't understand, it's perfect for kids, we had way more scary movies when I was younger, and we grew up fine.
Teach your kids the difference between movies and real life, you'll see, it works.",positive
Hardcore Henry,"I believe this to be the very First Person movie produced for mass audiences. The trailer is enough to captivate anyone that watches it at first glance, so I was excited to make sure I watched it on the big screen because it didn't seem like the type of movie that would be worth watching at home. I didn't go watch because of the plot, I went, like many others, just for the experience of a 90 minutes of a first person action film. Where it failed: All sequences looked the same except with different ""thugs"" and different guns. It felt like the movie looped at least 4 times. I am not sure the correct word to use in this situation is ""bored"" but I was tired of the same thing over and over by the first 30 minutes I wanted to walk out, but I didn't want to miss ""SOMETHING"", which never really came. The experience was not that great, it was not like the 180 degree cinemas they had back in the days where they would put you on the seat of a roller coaster and you could really feel like you were part of it. I wasn't able to feel included, it did not really seem that immersive as I thought it was going to be. Although I didn't come for the plot, I have to say this movie was just weird. I won't get into the details but it was all over the place, a mess really. I am not sure more like these will be produced, It will all depend on how the mass audience reacts to the title, but although I do not see a future for ""first person movies"" I do think this is a gateway into 360 Virtual Reality movies, which in theory at least, sounds very interesting. I have to say, go watch it for the experience of something completely different, but don't expect anything out of the ordinary",negative
Hardcore Henry,"'Hardcore' is the riveting story of a newly-made cyborg who must save his wife from evil tyrants and...wait a minute. Who cares?? The whole movie is a blast!!Ilya Naishuller is a young director who had a very cool idea to shoot an action film from a first-person perspective using a GoPro Hero3 Black Edition camera. The proof of concept was released as ""Biting Elbows: Bad Motherf***er"". It was pitched publicly and helped to successfully crowd-fund the feature, 'Hardcore'.It's better to keep this short and sweet: the film is extraordinarily violent; not for the squeamish. It has plenty of action, free-running, stunts, and plenty of room for comedic elements. Even the opening titles give you a taste of what's to come!Sharlto Copley (District 9, and other Neill Blomkamp projects) plays the main POV's assistant throughout the film. Copley definitely gives a range of character performances and is quality. Wearing many hats, he guides you along as if you were needing assistance in a video game, which, by the way, this film makes several references to. In particular, the Chernobyl level in Call of Duty 4 with Capt. MacMillian. Even the opening scenes are reminiscent of Half-Life, and a lot of the free-running scenes are inspired by Mirror's Edge.For those who are wondering, no. You likely won't get dizzy watching a 90-minute action film from an FP perspective. Well, maybe you shouldn't sit in the front row. Otherwise, you will have a blast.'Hardcore' is an all-around fun time. Just be okay with the violence. It's only 90 minutes of your time that you'll likely want to experience over and over again. Or, you'll just want to plug in a play a few games. Either way, it's bloody fun!",positive
R.I.P.D.,"Having read some other reviews, my expectations were low. I'm so glad we took a chance on this little gem.We went to a matinée. Everyone in the group I went with enjoyed the movie. The rest of the audience in the theater was laughing right along with us.My husband was chatting with a couple of folks as we were walking out, and they were saying that they could not figure out why this movie was getting such a bad rap because they really enjoyed it too.Jeff Bridges was hilarious in his role as the experienced cop and Ryan Reynolds was marvelous eye candy. Kevin Bacon played a bad guy we all had a good time disliking.The special effects were so good that they never took you out of the movie to think about how they did it, you just went along for the ride. Some of the friends I went with can't handle 3D, so we saw the regular version.I can't remember laughing out loud so much in a theater in a very long time.All in all, I'd say we had a great time and highly recommend this movie as summer escapist fun!",negative
R.I.P.D.,"I saw he trailers and wondered if the movie would be as funny, or if they had shown all the ""good stuff"" in the trailer. Well, I'm happy to report that the trailers captured much of the essence of the movie, but the movie itself has much more. I don't know what some of the critics expect. Shakespeare? Hey, this is a comic book movie. It is a fantasy. It is not real and not meant to be real. But it IS also fun. It is quite possible that this movie will lose money, but that is simply because of bad positioning, overwhelming competition, and failure to deliver adequate advertising. But none of those things detract from the movie itself. I went to the movie with some trepidation, but found it to be funny and entertaining. It was consistent with its premise and it certainly had enough action, and even (gasp) character development. There is nothing really deep about this movie, okay? But it is good summer entertainment and definitely worth seeing.",positive
Victor Frankenstein,"Im just speechless as i saw that this movie got a rating as high as 6.2, i'm sure that most people who gave it a high rating saw only the trailer at best.let me tell you a little about this movie without spoiling and pray god that my English will be understandable, well what this movie is about is that you wait for something to happen and you wait and you keep waiting and.... it happens, but when it happens actually nothing happens, to summarize it two weirdos make something to destroy it in the end, exactly like a kid who makes a sand castle but in the end he gets bored and destroy it.This movie is a waste of time.",negative
Victor Frankenstein,"This movie is exceedingly British and I love that. I don't want to go into too much detail with this review, but there were so many great things about this movie to the extent I could write a lengthy book about the things I admired in this film.The accents were sublime and posh, the technology of the era was just about right without going too over the top and making people weird and anti-social and due to the lack of cars and relatively slow movement of people it makes me appreciate my lovely electric bike much more, when I'm doddering along at 15 mph on it I think back to those Victorians in this film who would've been delighted with such quick speeds, I fantasise about Victor accompanying me on his steampunk steam powered bike doing 15 mph and having a great laugh with him, my imaginary friend known as Victor Frankenstein wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for this film. All the characters seem so politically sane in this film which is a very refreshing breather from today's harsh, stupid political climate.Also the monster at the end of this film looks very tasty so this film always gives me a great appetite and gives me a longing for some delicious rats, balut, black pudding and mum's foot sweat every time I watch this amazing film. The scenery was truly beautiful and the scenes of London outside made me smell the sweet smell of steam power which made me nostalgic for the old steam ralleys I went to as a kid. You'll enjoy this film if you're British but I don't recommend it to Americans as Americans would probably get too jealous of Victorian London.",positive
Captive State,"I don't know where to start because this movie doesn't even know where it's going. The first hour of the movie has no action or aliens yet the trailer made it look like some cool action movie. There is absolutely no character building so you don't give a crap about the cast to the point where you don't even know who is who or what the character's names are. Do yourself a favor if you are thinking about watching this movie and don't. A waste of time, money and film.",negative
Captive State,"This is probably the best sci fi movie to come out since Children of Men. The reviews I've read from this are atrocious... Den of Geek says that the scenes just ""happen."" What?! Isn't that what a movie should be? Geekwire says that the movie lacks a presence of aliens.... WHAT?! This is a thinking man's sci fi with some of the most tense scenes filmed that I've seen for a long time. This is what would happen in a police state.... Go into it with a fresh approach and you will leave ultimately satisfied. Don't go into it thinking it's some super hero movie... Because honestly Joseph Campbell's a heros journey can only be told so many times. And in all honestly - this is the best movie thus far of 2019.",positive
The Last Days on Mars,"First off. The description for this film states that it was made at Elstree Studios, Borehamwood, England. The interiors and sound were both done at Ardmore Studios, Bray, Ireland. Just thought I'd put that out there.It's basically a zombie movie set on Mars. People develop an infection, die, come back and again and try to kill the nearest person. Who carries on in similar fashion. Never been done before so.You get the impression watching it that the director has seen a few sci-fi movies. He just doesn't have anything original to add to the genre.The script is pedestrian, humourless, predictable; with no sense of the impending doom that should have bled from the screen. From the moment the Russian guy falls into the hole in the ground, you can pretty much figure out what's gonna happen. And it does. Exactly as you'd expect it to.Films are supposed to take you out of yourself, surprise you, entertain you, immerse you in the world that they have created. This film did none of those./yawn.",negative
The Last Days on Mars,"This review is intended to win over those who love sci-fi, but feel a little wary of even viewing The Last Days of Mars due to the poor overall review ratings. There is a severe dearth of science fiction movies out there, let alone good ones, so if you're like me then you can identify with allowing yourself to relish in whatever a movie does well to immerse you and bring sci-fi to the screen convincingly.First, I'll tell you what I want to see when a sci-fi movie involves a space theme. I want equipment, vehicles, space ships and sets to look detailed, interesting and look like they belong there. I think they did an excellent job with all this. I'm sure an astronaut or annoying know-it-all snobs could point out whatever may be incorrect, but it all looked awesome to me. It made me feel like everything was filmed on mars, or in a space station etc.Long before I ever saw this movie I recall having read that it was very low budget. It never looked that way to me. Everything looked so professionally designed. To give an example, I loved how the land vehicles looked. They were a typical 6 wheeled monster, but were particularly detailed with what looked like logos of tech sponsors and flags of whatever countries were imagined to be involved in space exploration. That was some subtly added depth for me.The special effects and CGI looked flawless to me including a small zero gravity scene and flashback scenes of a space station for example. The backgrounds outdoors on mars also looked quite impressive to me as well. I've never really seen photos of Mars, but the rock formations looked foreign to me. I couldn't tell you if they were CGI composites or not. That's a good thing. Overall, I am astounded they could accomplish what they did with just £7,000,000 for the budget. I would have expected to see cheaply painted foam rocks at every turn, plain white panels everywhere and no CGI whatsoever for that price. The acting never really takes a back seat for me, but it was amazing by any standards I would hold for any high budget drama movie. The cast was absolutely fantastic including the supporting actors. The dialogue and behaviour of the characters never had me rolling my eyes either. Many of the characters were easily likable and the one that we are meant to dislike manages to be dynamic within the story line. That's rare in this type of movie. The story is zombie themed as you may have read. I'm painfully aware of how overdone this theme is, and although this take on zombies won't surprise or scare you in new ways, it doesn't ruin the movie. The reason is because the characters seem to behave believably and the zombies don't possess more power than the usual superhuman toughness you've come to expect. Thankfully, you won't see idiotic scenes that countless horror movies do with characters putting themselves in stupider situations than you could even imagine. If you must slam the story for being typical and mediocre for its story I can't really argue with you, but I sure as hell am not willing to listen to you. This movie won't ever top some of my favourites, such as Solaris (1972), or Moon (Sam Rockwell), but once again, if you want to see a movie where the sets and technology make you feel like you're in space, you will get some enjoyment out of The Last Days on Mars. The superb acting and cast is a welcome surprise bonus.",positive
Transcendence,"Transcendence had so much potential. Johnny Depp. Morgan Freeman. Big budget sci-fi thriller commenting on the evolutionary struggle between man and machine. What could possibly go wrong? Everything, apparently. There is no way that a scientist (Paul Bettany), who's been off the grid in a cave somewhere for two years, could write a virus that would outsmart a self-aware supercomputer (Johnny Depp) so advanced over the same time period that it can literally build a human copy of itself from the sands of the earth. No way. Even if the original source code was written by said cave scientist, the movie establishes that the supercomputer has been re-writing its code ever since it became self-aware. Paul's character wasn't even as smart as the human Johnny Depp, and we're expected to believe that Paul can outsmart Johnny as a supercomputer with unlimited resources? Sigh. And to the subject of national defense. A lone FBI agent, who's not even a high ranking official, makes the decision to side with a known terrorist group to shut down all networks and electricity on the planet? Seriously? The United States government, or any other world government, would sooner take out the terrorist cell (and the FBI agent) and negotiate with the supercomputer before allowing all hospitals, communication, commerce, defense and refrigeration to shut down in a moment's notice.And even if we take the premise that the supercomputer committed suicide to save the life of the scientist who wrote the virus, why would he do that? He could have easily saved the scientist, his wife (Rebecca Hall)and everyone else, by just taking the gun from the terrorist holding the scientist hostage. He can sprout nanotechnology from the ground (which is how he took everybody else's gun). Double sigh. I was very disappointed, again because this movie had so much potential. Instead of being awesome, it's just another classic example of poor script writing and relying on big names and special effects to do the job. What's worse, the makers of this film should have known better. Shame. Normally, I'd give this movie a 4/10. However, for its audacity to advertise brilliance and be anything but, it gets a 1.",negative
Transcendence,"Don't know why all the negative review about this movie, but reading their negative comment it seems to me that they expected something else and it is not delivered hence they are throwing a tantrum and choose not to enjoy the movie.While its cons might be the lack of characters development this doesn't change the fact that the story line and concept is better than a lot of other movies and it is presented well. The story might feel a bit stretched but it give us more time to think and enjoy the development of the movie.It doesn't show too much of the potential of an AI, nor it have a lot of actions scenes, but it does show us a lot of perspective and views on a single ideas, and what misunderstanding and doubt could do. The movie doesn't show you what is right or wrong, or which is the best solution, it only show us the thinking of each characters and the consequences from their actions.If you love thoughts provoking movie which leave you with a lot of thinking, you will definitely like this movie.",positive
Ice Age: Collision Course,"Original is not a word that comes to mind when watching the fifth (yes FIFTH) entry in this tired, worn, quite frankly burned out franchise.What does come to mind however is the fact this franchise has gone on for far too long.If you can't come up with any original ideas and you have to scrap the deepest barrel for the most unoriginal idea as possible, it's time to go.If you can't keep your characters fresh and funny and make them more boring, dull and annoying to watch, it's time to go.If you're out of jokes to use and you pull some random rabbit out of a hat and it's a rabbit that says ""Think of some really bad jokes mate."", it's time to go.If you have 4 (yes, I do mean 4) writers and not one of them can give any good dialogue out, it's time to go.And when a franchise that is constantly dead in the water is still going like THIS, it's time to go.I don't care if these films still make money, Fox, it's time to put this franchise on ice forever!",negative
Ice Age: Collision Course,"While trying to bury his acorn, Scrat accidentally activates an abandoned alien ship that takes him into deep space, where he unwittingly sends several asteroids en route to a collision with Earth.Meanwhile, Manny is worried about the upcoming marriage between Peaches and her fiancé, Julian, while Diego and his wife Shira want to start a family but their fierce appearance tend to scare kids, and Sid is dumped by his girlfriend, Francine, just as he is about to propose to her. During Manny and Ellie's wedding anniversary party, some of the asteroids strike the place and the herd barely escape with their lives. Meanwhile, at the underground cavern, Buck returns a dinosaur egg back to its rightful owner after it was stolen from a trio of Dromaeosaurs led by their father Gavin, only to discover an ancient stone pillar, which he takes to the surface, where he meets Manny and the others.Buck explains to the herd that according to the pillar, the asteroids had caused several extinctions in the past and with a massive one still incoming, he claims that the only place they could find a clue to stop it is on the site of the impact of the previous ones, as according to its engravings, they always fall at the same place. However, the three Dromaeosaurs, having listened their conversation, decide to stop them, believing that they could be safe from the impact, as they can fly, thus not only getting their revenge on Buck, but also killing all mammals and securing domination over Earth for their species.As the herd travels to the crash site, they discover that the asteroids have electro-magnetic properties, thus if a huge quantity of smaller asteroids should be gathered and launched into orbit, they could attract the main asteroid as well and prevent it from falling on Earth. After facing several obstacles and the interference of the Dromaeosaurs, the herd arrives at ""Geotopia"", a community of animals formed inside one of the asteroids that have fallen long ago, where Sid meets Brooke, a female ground sloth who falls in love with him. However, Shangri Llama, the leader of Geotopia, refuses to cooperate with Buck's plan to send the city's crystals into space in order to prevent the imminent impact, as they are the key to the residents' longevity, until Sid unwillingly destroys the entire city when he attempts to remove one of the stones to present Brooke with, making all the Geotopians grow old up to their real ages, including Brooke herself.Once Brooke convinces the Geotopians that preventing the asteroid's fall is more important than their lost youth, they and the herd help with Buck's plan, which is to fill up a geyser with the crystals so that the pressure launches them into space to draw the asteroid away, but the Dromaeosaurs attempt to intervene, until one of them, realizing that they will not survive as well if the asteroid falls, convinces the others to also help. The plan works, and the asteroid is pulled back into space. The herd then departs back home, including Sid, who parts ways from Brooke, but just after they leave, an asteroid piece falls inside a hot spring, giving it rejuvenating properties and making the Geotopians and Sid's granny, who stayed behind with them regain their youth. After the herd returns, Peaches and Julian celebrate their wedding, Diego and Shira become heroes to the kids who were scared of them before, and a rejuvenated Brooke appears during the ceremony to reunite with Sid.In the film's epilogue, Scrat keeps struggling to control the alien ship until it crashes on Mars, destroying all life on the planet.",positive
Chappie,"I don't usually write reviews on here, but I have to get this off my chest. This is more of a warning than a review.I saw the high rating on IMDb and gave this movie a shot. The trailer looked decent and reminded me of good action scenes in District 9. I wanted to leave while watching the movie so many times. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did... I had my hopes up when the thugs were teaching Chappie how to stab people that he'd stab them, I'd have a laugh, and we'd move on to some other characters and a better movie! But I was let down on that one. The movie doesn't go anywhere. You just hang out with the obnoxious Die Antwoord members the whole time. Others have mentioned the movie being like Short Circuit and Robocop, but the movie even adds a flare of Transcendence towards the end -- Chappie figures out how to transfer consciousness to save his maker, himself and even ""mommy."" Ninja keeps going on about a heist he wants Chappie to help him with the whole movie. The heist was my ticket price and 2 hours. I felt frustrated and let down after watching this movie.

The judgements and discussions that occurred during the film made me realize how judgemental we really all are. Even though it is very dialogue heavy, I didn't get bored.

Happy Death Day 2U,"There's a plot point in this movie where the lead character cannot decide if she should sacrifice her mom's life so she can date some random guy she's known for less than two weeks, or let her mom live and not date the guy she literally just met. Like, yeah, choose the new guy over your mom's life. There are plenty of mom's in the sea! Boyfriends are forever! And that's just the tip of the stupidberg. The science behind everything is so cartoonish. At one point, the scientist who invented it even tries to kill his other timeline self in order to stop the device from going off. That's right, he resorts to murdering his other self instead of, you know, just explaining things TO HIMSELF. But wait! There's more stupid! The timelines now get changed so much that the killer is now someone else. And this is where the movie will really piss you off most. With the first killer, the motivation worked, but with the new killer, the motivation is so paper-thin, it's like the writers had to pick someone so they rolled some dice. And if you're here for the horror, guess what? The real horror is finding out this is secretly a feel-good, rom-com. Not even kidding. The (actual) killer is rarely even in the movie. If you must watch this movie, get a bunch of friends together so you can at least share some laughs while you all make fun of it.",negative

Spectral,"I've seen a couple of straight to Netflix films and to be honest, with the exception of Bright, I've mostly been disappointed. So, you can probably understand the apprehension I had when it came to watching this film. Well, it turned out that I could not have been more wrong because, honestly, this film was nothing short of awesome. As another reviewer pointed out this is the type of film that Hollywood, when it does well, can go really well - not much story, but great action and great special effects. Well, story, I probably wouldn't say that the story was that bad either.The film is set in Eastern Europe, which honestly is a break from your typical Middle Eastern terrorist trope of late, but then again the whole Middle Eastern terrorist trope is honestly so naughties. No, now we are going back to Eastern Europe, and the not so subtle 'Russia is the enemy' again, which honestly opens up so much more for secret technological experiments that have the potential of completely overwhelming a force of highly trained US soldiers - which is what the case is here in this film.Yeah, we are in Moldovia where a totalitarian government has collapsed, but there is still fighting going on between insurgents and rebel forces. Yeah, the US is here, but they are only here as peacekeepers (which is probably a little unrealistic anyway considering that in this part of the world the US are openly sending in their troops to keep the peace, particularly since there happens to be another superpower just over the border that happens to have a completely different interpretation of what keeping the peace happens to mean). Anyway, there seems to be some strange things going on, and the government decides to send this DARPA scientist over to find out what's going on.To cut a story short, it appears in all intents and purposes to be ghosts, but there actually is a lot more behind the fact that they are basically fighting ghosts, but I honestly don't want to give too much away because that would spoil the fun (and I've already had some shows spoiled because I have accidentally read ahead while trying to find out other things). In a way though, this film did remind me a lot of Black Hawk Down, but with a much more supernatural element to it than the previous film, which was just American soldiers killing heaps of Somali's, and somehow managing to survive the encounter.Well, it felt like that in part, that is until I realised it was a little more than that, and in whole 'let's get the hell out of dodge' part of the film was probably only about a third, namely because the are actually going in there to attempt to get their wounded back, and also to possibly capture one of the ghosts. It is only when they realise that they are way, way over their head that it becomes evident that retreat is the only option.Yeah, this film actually turned out to be pretty intense, and was much, much better than expected. It certainly is one of those films that will keep an sci-fi action buff entertained for a little over an hour and a half.",negative
Spectral,"Netflix have really upped their game with their original titles lately, and this film is no exception. The acting is good, the story is relatively original (considering how many themes are usually recycled ad nauseum in sci-fi) and the special effects were absolutely outstanding.The pace of the film is perfect and there's never a reason to lose interest, especially as our cast delve deeper into the mystery of what's going on and how to deal with it. The tension themes were similar to Darkest Hour & FF:SW insofar as you never quite knew where the threats were going to come from at any given time, despite the countermeasures in place. Some people have compared the story with those two titles pre-release, and after watching you can see how it could be inspired by them, but only as much as other themes in cinema inspire each other; the story itself is very original.If you like your action with an original story and extremely well- polished, then you'll probably enjoy this.",positive
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,"This is the last time I sit in the middle of the row. Had I been sitting on the aisle I would have left long before the movie was over.Maybe if I were in the 13 to 24 age bracket and had grown up playing video games...Or maybe if I were still a little boy at heart and still played video games...One reviewer lauded the ""jaw dropping"" visual fx. Really? Was this person exaggerating or just haven't been to the movies in about 20 years? Nothing new here. Same visual fx you'll see in any 200 million movie or a video game.The bottom line is this movie is just like a big long expensive video game. If you like that then go see it. Except don't be disappointed if they don't let you have the controller.Don't get me wrong, I think it's totally cool when a bad guy can get run over by and Escalade(after having beaten up The Rock, for crying out loud) and get right back up and run away. It's also kind of cool that he can get on a motorcycle, start it, put it in gear AND ride safely away in less time than it takes for said Escalade to hit a dumpster. Also, it was interesting that Duke had the time to yell ""Incoming"" get Flint out of the way yet he sits there and takes it like a man. I guess Tatum wanted out of his contract. Maybe he saw this going the same way as Police Academy 15.I'm not sure why I expect so much from a movie based on a toy. My only question is where will they go next? They have GI Joe, Battle Ship, Transformers, Rock'em Sock'em Robots(Real Steel)... what's next? Toss Across? Battling Tops? Maybe they'll make a sci-fi flick about silly putty. (I wonder if producers read these things to get ideas)And the dialog was pretty bad. I was trying to remember one particular line that was really bad but I guess it was so disgusting that it ran screaming out of my memory. RZA was the absolute worst part of the whole thing. The Rat in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was a better actor than RZA. Where's Master Po when you need him? I'm not sure why anyone thinks Rappers make good actors. Anyway, lots of action, some way hot chicks who kick but (always cool, IMO) AND there will probably be another sequel.If all that sounds like it's worth $10 bucks to you then have at it. I wait until movies come to the $2 theater and sometimes they aren't even worth that much.",negative
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,"G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra feels like it belongs to a different age of blockbusters. It had a hard time fitting in to the modern generation thus most moviegoers never find it as appealing as the other films that was released on that year. Those rants can be true only in some reasons. The film is undeniably silly and dumb but it was never boring and has its own quality. Since people are now asking for darker and much serious blockbusters, this sequel reduces all the silliness that was displayed on the original. G.I. Joe: Retaliation is cooler and less cartoony. Unfortunately, it is also less exciting and terribly uninspired. The action may be better looking but the lack of fortitude and creativity made it fall short into another visual showcase stress.""Awesome"" is the main goal of this sequel. While the original was too corny to impress, this film darkens the tone and made it a bit down to earth. It abandons the silly gadgets and the ridiculous laws of physics that was shown in the original. But the film fails to be both dark and realistic. Not only because of those robotic fireflies and the mass annihilating missiles but the secret prisons and the government are unbelievably dumb to manage their job. Well, it's a blockbuster based on toys so it will never be too realistic. Deal with it while we are here for the fun. The dark aspects aren't dark at all. What they only do is to be serious. This seriousness blocks the potential joy and turns it into standard blockbuster bland.The storytelling is quite messy. It's like an uninteresting version of Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol with uninteresting characters. The storytelling from the first movie wasn't great either since it is cluttered with cheesy flashbacks. But it's worse here because it takes some twists that are absurdly incoherent. And so, it's all pretentious. The characters are boring and even the performances can't bring them to life. Dwayne Johnson is the only good thing among them though, Bruce Willis is trying to make fun of himself again as a crazy grandaddy, and the villains ham it up which isn't suppose to be a bad thing but they can't give enough personality to them.The action scenes are acceptable enough to call awesome at least. With all the explosions and the none CGI-ed machines, it seems to be really exciting, but it's not. It does a fine job to be pretty but there's a difference between good looking and exciting. There's only a little suspense. If there is actually suspense and joy then it would be found at the mountain ninja fight but it's just mild and still glosses some slow motions in it. For the rest of the action, the heroes are always superior. Plus more explosions and slow-mos. The action is stylishly directed anyway. The fight between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow remains to be the only action that excites and one part of the climax has a nutty scene with The Rock riding huge vehicles and shooting like a badass. The production designs, special effects, and costumes gets better. What else to talk about it?The absence of the Joes' ridiculous transportation and weapons, holograms, and other snazzy gadgets may please our modern viewers but it also forgets why this material is interesting anyway. Now we only get typical military stuff. It still has some crazy devices but it's limited compare to the first film. Rise of Cobra wasn't a classic. It's nothing more than a simple guilty pleasure. Same with Retaliation except this one can't even be completely pleasurable unless you want some endless visual coolness. Cool is not a bad thing but it could have been creative and much more exciting instead of showing off slow-mos on screen. To be fair, it's mildly entertaining and good to look at. If the film wasn't this visually awesome, it would have been an empty cinema. The series still fails to justify its source material.",positive
Penguins of Madagascar,"While everyone else in the world adores penguins, there is one group out to destroy their cuteness. Their name is... Dreamworks Studios. Even though skipper, kowalski, rico, and private are amazing characters, combining the elements of penguin cuteness, sophisticated humor, and slapstick comedy, this movie certainly did not uphold those previous character elements. The first part of the movie is a nice introduction to how the penguins became who they are now and gave a nice backstory. However, the rest of the movie (to put it lightly), sucked REALLY bad. This was easily the worst Dreamworks movie I had ever seen. The main villain looks like a cartoon version of a Tim Burton character, the plot is meaningless, and the jokes are few and far between. They could have made countless jokes about fracking, global warming, oil spills and the countless other environmental problems we have today. They could've gotten morgan freeman to do the introduction, they could have had a few cameos from the other madagascar characters. (SPOLIER SENTENCE NEXT) But instead, the main villain was an octopus that was jealous of how cute the penguins were so he captured them all and tried to turn them ugly. So they partnered up with four one dimensional secret agent characters who somehow have millions of dollars. Care to elaborate on those characters? Can we have an introduction? Maybe just something? No? Okay. I'm sorry but what a waste. Seriously the transformers movies have a comparable plot. Wait did I just say that? Sparknotes: Do yourself a favor and don't go see this movie. It honestly spoiled the Madagascar franchise for me. SERIOUSLY IT SUCKED",negative
Penguins of Madagascar,"This is masterpiece. Being 20 years old guy, i still like to watching this cartoon. Sometimes my 40 y\o father when have a time watch this. It's really funny cartoon where are different stories, like about love, about friendship, about action, about moral values! Each character full of their life way!Skipper-Team leader. Always keeps team in healthy shape. Always says what to do and how to do. He use his ""King slap"" to calm down members of team. It's really funny and by this he emphasizes his leadership. And it is ridiculous in my opinion, is when he says the name of the operation. ""Okay guys, we start operation ""******"" Let's go!"" (c) Skipper. Ahahahah :D Kowalski-Brain of team. He always have plan. Always! True scientist! His inventions strange but very interesting :D Scientist's language very funny. When Kowalski start to explain something, it's line OMG, wut :DD Which makes it really funny :) In many movies\cartoons in every team must be clever guy, i think in penguins it depicts the most fun, cool and exciting!Rico-""Mad KABOOM Guy"" I gave him this name :) Very strange one, which makes him very special in this team. He can only speak a few words, and the rest he can only make sounds. That's what makes him special :) Really funny guy :) YOu should watch him and u will understand me :))Private-cutie of team. Very friendly one :) He always finds in people's kindness and honesty (with Skipper all the way around).

Anon,"It starts out very promising. The idea is interesting, albeit very Black Mirror-esque, and the special effects are subtle enough to convey the premise well. However, it's the future and the main character is smoking cigarettes like it's 1987?There are way too many script cliches and tacky one-liners to a point it distracts from the plot. Of which there seems to be little of as the movie progresses. The promising start seems to get watered down drastically with the bad script and mediocre delivery (sometimes it's hard to distinguish which is at fault). Cheap nudity is abound, a shoehorned sex scene (Amanda Seyfried's trademark), all the tell tale signs of low confidence in the plot's interest levels. The problem with the plot is that even the gratuitous nudity couldn't keep it afloat. The dead son sub-plot was an interesting touch that wasn't explored enough. Instead of deepening the character it was brushed off as leverage for cheap tension. Somehow more hookers seemed more important to the plot's progression than building the characters.The decisions made by the main character (Sal) are at best baffling, I don't understand that character nor was I able to relate to him in any way.I will not watch this movie again nor will I recommend it to anyone.",negative
Anon,"There are not much ""Must see"" on my list. but this is one of them.
A technothriller, romance, sci-fi, ""film noir"" all rolled in one. Excellent casting, thrilling story, amazing cineo, and awesome sound design. This is a flick with the same intense story telling as gataca, another must see. Clive Owen is amazing in chillying cold abstractisness as Amanda Seyfried warm nerdiness. Apart from that a chilling cautionary tail of what lays beyond. There is a future without privacy (what is privacy?) that we will embrace and despise equally.

Self/less,"This idea, contrary to some opinions is an old one. This one is exactly John Scalzi's, ""Old Man's War"" series idea but Ol' John Perry had no idea what he was in for. In this outing of the idea Damien Hale did know at least as much as the crippled Jake Sully in Avatar knew. Figure the dates..., and Avatar was probably ""influenced"" by Old Man's War. But it is a great idea, and folks can do a lot with it. This one is a tried and true ""character quest plot"" as well, which explaining creeps into the spoiler category if you don't already know what it is. If you do, you know those are usually great stories.To me it was predictable. Not the movies fault that I've read a lot. The plot has a couple ways to go. The way this one went is probably the most popular and well liked. I was a little surprised it wasn't ""more"". I think I just was not feeling the crash, bang, boom going on. I would have liked a little more getting in touch with the ""past training"". I think that would have sold me on the crash, bang, boom more convincingly.Don't misunderstand, it is a good movie. Ben Kingsley can do no wrong by me. Ryan Reynolds is working on getting there himself, and I have a spot in my heart for Natalie Martinez from the Under the Dome days. Sprinkle in some Victor Garber and you have a set of actors almost always worth watching. I enjoyed a couple of surprising plot point twists that I didn't see coming. Movie might be worth watching for those alone. It is great when a story surprises and that isn't an easy thing to sell to well conditioned entertainment consumers.To me it is 7 stars reaching for 8 and almost making it. First review I looked at before watching the movie had me feeling like I was out in the desert looking into the night sky there were so many stars. It's worth watching. Then you decide.",negative
Self/less,"This is awesome science fiction. Wonderfully crafted.By 40 minutes in I knew this film was absolutely fantastic. A welcome treat among so many scripts that tend to walk the line of ""the ridiculously over the top.""Ryan seems to be winning me over with serious roles, more and more, as he matures as an actor. He does very well in the roll that Ben Kingsley gets started in a journey to achieve ""Immortality."" The fact that the film was shot exceptionally tastefully, had a great cast, and contained a worthy script makes it a shoe in for a good ride at the very least.You should take it.It's a return to what Science Fiction should really be. A continually changing bar or understanding of the universe as we ""dare to dream the things that might be within our grasps tomorrow.""",positive
The Titan,"What makes The Titan so bad is that it had an engaging premise, a promising first act, and decent actors. That lures you in enough to make you want to see where it goes.Well, I'll tell you where it goes. Right into the toilet.It plays out very much as if they only had budget for actors, scenery, some effects, and a decent screenwriter for the first act. Sadly, the budget must have failed then, and the janitors finished the script. (I shouldn't impugn decent, hardworking janitors that way; they probably would have done a better job.)It just completely stops making ANY sense, AND forgets the first act. Wife keeps being shocked that the husband who signed up to be transformed is being transformed. Keeps telling the doctor who warned of a bumpy and risky transformation that he'd lied to her...because the transformation is (A) happening, and being (B) bumpy and (C) risky.And it just keeps getting stupider from there on, all the way to the stupid, stupid end sequences.You're left with nothing but unanswerable questions.Like:* What did the wife THINK was going to happen?
* Why did Worthington's character suddenly totally change, bodily, after a single surgery?
* What does sitting under water holding your breath have to do with breathing nitrogen?
* How can he go back and forth from breathing nitrogen to breathing air -- shouldn't his breath have poisoned his wife and son?
* What was the brilliant wife's long-term game-plan in giving him saline?
* Why did she take along the main doctor's assistant?
* Why did the woman candidate kill her husband?
* Why is it OK that Worthington's character murdered innocent soldiers doing their job?
* What is achieved by sending a single mutated human to Titan?
* Wouldn't it have been simpler to mutate humans to be able to remain on Earth?
* What animal's genes made tentacles shoot out their hands?...and so on and so forth.Just don't be left with this question: ""Why did I watch this after so many warnings?""",negative
The Titan,"Just watched Titan and wow, it made me angry. I rarely write movie reviews, but this one moved me to action. Since Netflix no longer allows reviews on its site, here's my first IMDB review. This crappy script is a waste of excellent acting talent and awesome special effects. Kudos to the actors who did the best they could with an uneven script, faux-science, WTF scenes and progressively more stilted dialogue. The movie isn't bad for the first 45 minutes. I had figured out it wasn't going to have a satisfying ending by that point, but I wanted to see how they'd spin it, so I kept going. The faux-science was fun to eye-roll over. But then our hero soldiers finally go through the full metamorphosis (after a ""what? why did they need surgery?"" scene) and are unable to talk, change facial expressions, write, or in any other way communicate except by ""sonar and touch"".And from that point, the script went completely into a FTW-WERE-YOU-THINKING tailspin. So many stupid actions in such a short time can make a movie-watcher dizzy. The coup-de-grace was the final 18 minutes. It's like the producers said, ""Let's just do a few disassociated scenes. No one is watching anymore, anyway."" I lost track of how many times I said, ""Wait, what?"" So many times. Netflix, fess up. Is this steaming pile of a movie, and your other original programming, the reason you no longer allow reviews? If you can't handle poor reviews, improve your quality management. Now you've forced people to find other public forums to air their opinions. That probably means fewer positive reviews (because why go to the effort when we liked the movie?), more negative reviews (because we want to warn people away from bad ones) and lower ratings (because we're mad about having to click to another site to leave the review).",positive
The Silence,"You only need a blender to kill these creatures, yet they take over the world?Stupid movie, there's no reason to fear those creatures as they are easy to trap and destroy!Come on guys, this is ridiculous! Those critters are blind and hunt on sound only, a simple thing like a noisy blender would attract them and kill them easily and in great numbers, just as shown in one scene where they massively fly into a wood chipper machine and are chopped to pieces by the hundreds. Hey, a meat grinder or even a document shredder would do the job! Yet everybody has to move north to colder zones in order to survive because those little monsters can't stand the cold!Also noise can easily be used to manipulate them, whether to attract them or to lure them away, also shown in another scene, so there are so many easy ways to get rid of them that the whole movie makes no sense at all!These creatures come in great numbers, but depend on their ears to locate their prey and on their teeth to attack them. This is such a great weakness that they pose only a threat for really stupid and careless people. The army? The police? Just ran away? Got killed perhaps?The movie could have been more fun with some more realism or at least more logic, showing some creative methods to fend of a light threat resulting in a happy ending. For example a barking dog wearing a spiky armor, complete with helmet, it would attract vesps and have them killed by empaling themselves on the spikes of the armor. Also chainmail is effective against bites, especially from smaller creatures, so come on, where's the one eyed guy that is supposed to be king in the world of the blind?This movie could have been a very good one, but as usual original ideas tend to turn into completely worthless movies. This is one of them.The Tremors franchise is a lot better, at least they don't take themselves too seriously and there's less inconsistencies.The Silence is an absolute failure. Not worth your time.",negative
The Silence,"Overall this is a decent enough time killer. It's got a good cast, and some wonderful music and scenes. The problem is the story as a whole.The ""monsters"" made little sense in terms of the threat the movie wanted to make them portray. Not much thought was put into them other than ""we need a monster"". While they might be decent as a ""Pitch Black"" style swarm monster on a small scale, they do not work for what the movie intended. There's just so many things wrong with them.Add to that the incredibly bad ending, that was clearly a rush job and honestly added nothing to the movie. It was clearly a case of the writers trying to sound wise and simply failing horribly.This is a movie you can waste a bored afternoon watching, but there's far better ones out there.",positive
Pixels,"Adam Sandler is so wealthy at this point, he could about anything he wants, very well, but no.This movie should have been made FOR me. I am the target audience, I grew up in the 1980s and 1990s playing these games and I WANTED to love th hell out of this film, but this could be the worst movie of 2015. The video games attacking earth is a great idea, and execution of the game characters themselves is pretty good. The movie fails at its most basic as it is supposed to be a comedy but it's just not funny. Adam Sandler is clearly phoning it in, Kevin James is up to his usual antics, the clumsy fat guy, Josh Gad screams at the top of his lungs in every scene, and even the great Peter Dinklage is not good here, though Dinklage delivers the one laugh worthy moment in the film.I was disappointed when I discovered that Chris Columbus directed the movie, as he is usually really good.This is absolutely a 2/10 production, I'm not a hater, I wanted to love this movie so much, but the terrible execution from script to screen was too poor to even consider this as something that I could recommend in good faith. With a different lead actor/approach, this could have worked in spades, but the complete lack of effort here is the true disappointment. It's as though Adam Sandler didn't even try.",negative

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,"It was inevitable that the sequel would be imminent out within a couple of years to keep the memories of the first film fresh in people's minds.But my memories of that film were of this reboot being a complete waste of time, but with a decent set piece involving snow, and nothing more than a Michael Bay produced cash machine with no soul.The turtles face a new challenge when Shredder escapes from custody and joins forces with Baxter Stockman, a mad scientist who plans to use a serum to take over the world. Along for the ride are Bebop and Rocksteady, two dimwitted henchmen who provide plenty of muscle. Luckily, the turtles have their own allies in April O'Neil, Vernon Fenwick and Casey Jones, a hockey-masked vigilante...... As the pizza-loving heroes prepare for battle, the notorious Krang also emerges to pose an even greater threat.And this time it's pretty much the same, apart from the fact that there isn't a decent set piece in its ridiculously long running time, in fact, you'd be hard pressed to call this a actual film as it has not coherence, no narrative, it just goes from one place to another, and for a film focusing on giant Ninja Turtles, it's one of the most boring experiences I've had at the cinema this year.It's a CG nightmare, with soulless, hate worthy characters spouting and idiotic script to lifeless looking CG characters with attitude.It's as if Bay has just made one long commercial for toys, cars and clothing, and we've had to pay for the pleasure. But Bay has really outdone himself with this one, it's actually worse than Age Of Exhaustion, and by looking at the box office for this, people are becoming tired of his action movies.Really, if you were a fan of the Turtles back in the day, seek out Secret Of The Ooze, at least it has Vanilla Ice in it.",negative
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,"One year after their battle with the Shredder, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles still live in the shadows, having allowed Vern Fenwick to take the credit for Shredder's defeat. When Shredder is being transferred between prisons by corrections officer Casey Jones, his Foot Clan–operating under the direction of scientist Baxter Stockman–attack the convoy transporting him. The Turtles, tipped off to the escape attempt by April O'Neil, fend them off. Stockman is still able to affect Shredder's escape using a teleportation device, but Shredder is hijacked mid-teleport and winds up in another dimension. There, the alien warlord Krang gives him a mutagenic compound in exchange for his promise to find three components of a machine Krang sent to Earth in ages past, which when united will open a portal to his dimension.Shredder recruits the two criminals that were being transported alongside him, Bebop and Rocksteady, and has Stockman use Krang's mutagen on them to transform them into powerful animal mutants. The snooping April witnesses their transformation, and is able to steal the vial of mutagen. Pursued by the Foot, she is unexpectedly saved by Casey. In the scuffle, the vial is lost and taken into police custody. Donatello deduces that the mutagen could be used to turn the Turtles into humans, enabling them to live normal lives above ground, but Leonardo refuses and insists that he keeps it as a secret from the others. However, Michelangelo overhears their conversation and tells Raphael. Rapheal furiously confronts Leonardo for not telling them about the Retro mutagen and being honest with them, which results in Leonardo benching him and Mikey off the mission. Raph then recruits Mikey, April, Casey, and Vern to break into the NYPD police headquarters to recover the mutagen. But the Foot arrive ahead of them and in the ensuing battle, the Turtles' existence is revealed to the police, who react with fear and hatred. The brothers escape, but April and Casey are arrested.With Shredder's forces having already recovered two of the pieces of the portal device, the Turtles track Bebop and Rocksteady where they have recovered the final piece from a jungle in Foz do Iguaçu at Brazil. The Turtles intercept their jet on its return journey via a plane-to-plane skydive, and although the resultant battle crashes the jet, Bebop and Rocksteady are still able to successfully escape with the final component. The Turtles return to New York just in time to watch as Stockman and Shredder complete the portal device and open the gateway to Krang's dimension, through which his modular war machine, the Technodrome, begins to emerge. Krang immediately betrays Shredder, freezing him and locking him away with his collection of other defeated foes.The Turtles see no way to combat the threat from the shadows and must decide whether or not to take the mutagen and become humans in order to fight openly. Leonardo finally agrees to do as his brothers wish, but Raphael shatters the vial, realizing that they must accept who and what they are. Vern recovers security footage that proves Stockman and Shredder's crimes and secures April and Casey's release, allowing them to facilitate a meeting between the Turtles and police chief Rebecca Vincent. With the acceptance and blessing of the police, the Turtles go into action, confronting Krang aboard the still- assembling Technodrome. Meanwhile, Casey keeps Bebop and Rocksteady busy while April and Vern defeat Shredder's lieutenant Karai and take control of the portal device. Once the Turtles locate the beacon around which the Technodrome is assembling, they hurl it back through the portal, taking Krang and the rest of the Technodrome with it, and April, Casey, and Vern shut the portal down, ultimately defeating the alien, but not before Krang swears he will return for revenge.The Turtles are honored by Vincent and the NYPD, but elect to keep their existence a secret from the public at large, deciding that being normal isn't nearly as fun as being a turtle.",positive

Second in command is Woody Harrelson, who puts the screen on fire. In one of his scariest roles, the Thespian portrays a villain that's hard to forget. The TREMENDOUS Steve Zahn is extraordinary & adds the much needed relief in the intense proceedings. Karin Konoval, also, is marvelous. Rest lend incredible support.On the whole, 'War for the Planet of the Apes' is A Mighty Winner! Don't Miss It.",negative
War for the Planet of the Apes,"A quick look at the bad reviews shows that most of them were written around the same time, mid July 2017 and most all of them are 1 star ratings, an obvious attack on the movie makers and nothing to do with the quality of the film. I urge you to ignore these fake reviews and read instead those written after the summer of 2017!",positive
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Seriously, Michael Bay & Co. should pay me for sitting through this ridiculous pile of tripe.Grew up with the comics and cartoon show, loved the 1990 movie. Every sense I possess was repeatedly violated with this poor excuse of a greedy cash grab and pizza hut endorsement.I knew not to expect, well, anything really that has Michael Bay's name attached to it, but somehow still managed to be surprised at the sheer badness.The turtles themselves look strange, and act strange. Michaleangelo is like some weird semi-gangsta who is downright creepy in a continuing reference obsession with April O'Neil. Raphael is aloof, but exists little beyond that. That's as far as they went trying to define either one of them. Leonardo, the brave leader, was completely robbed of his personality, characteristics, leadership and anything that would define him, and has always in the past. He is instead a dissolved Bouillon cube in a large pot of water....bland, bland, bland. His voice (Johnny Knoxville) is miscast, and would've been better befitting either Mikey or Raph...that is if they'd bothered to give them any personality.The biggest violations however, lay with Donatello and Splinter, as it seems they thought that hyper-charging the characters would somehow make them interesting, endearing or watchable. ""Donatello does machines"" translates into exploiting him as a constant, textbook, super nerd. And he does absolutely nothing beyond that. Also, he looks like a Ghostbuster. Say hi to Dr. Donatello Stantz. Instead of making Splinter the wise, insightful, deep, sensei he always has been, he's instead to a cardboard cutout that does a lot of ""action stuff"". Don't get me wrong, the Splinter of the cartoon and comics could certainly hold his own, but violence was always the last resort, and had a rationale. (reminds me of what they did to Yoda in the Star Wars prequels.) And he learns Ninjitsu from a book in the sewer, gone is any mysticism or any pivotal, emotional, or vital connection to important characters in the story.Shredder is lame. There's no other way to put it. He is also a hyper charged extension ""more blades piled on the suit will make him better!"" He is unrecognizable beyond the pile of CGI blades, has no depth, no real motivation, and feels needlessly shoe horned into the ""story"" Especially since they terminated any connection with Splinter, or the long important history between them. (by the way, welcome to ""plot convenience playhouse"" when you find out that the turtles and Splinter were pets of April's when she was a girl. How convenient. The biggest human violation is no doubt Megan Fox, who continues to show she's a vapid, terrible actress, incapable of emotion, facial expressions, or the ability to close her mouth. She's absolutely terrible and is no April O'Neil. Michael Bay continues to have an obsession with Megan Fox like you would not believe. She also has no class, instead of choosing to take criticism constructively and look to improving herself and growing into a mature, capable lady, she instead publicly insults any who bashes this movie; (rightfully so) by saying ""f**k you"". Real mature Megan, and a great example for your children.The best actor of the bunch, William Fichtner. I'm still trying to figure out what purpose he served and why he's in this movie to begin with, I keep looking, but...folks, I got nothing' (why is Will Arnett even here?)There's also some defiance of physics as a mountain the size of Everest is apparently located not too far outside NYC, complete with a truck that slides down the side of it for ten straight minutes, with fast paced, confusing, unimpressive special effects. The turtles are ridiculously bullet-proof (which leads me to why are the foot soldiers carrying machine guns? Or any guns for that matter?) The answer I came up with: lazy. Why bother to have some Ninjitsu students, or experts, or extras, in your Ninja movie, when it's easier to have a stunt guy fire a gun. (That or the entire budget went to lame special effects.) Lots of low energy, thick glass shattering, metal side of van punching through escapes that make no sense at all. A yawn inducing, passionless, ""tower rolling down the buildings of NYC"" anti-climatic moments. Lame, just lame.The solution: a marathon of the late 80's cartoon followed by a viewing of the 1990 movie..just to prove that Michael Bay hadn't killed my soul completely. 1/10.",negative
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"I luckily avoid reading opinions before seeing a movie. This movie was a perfect entertainment for the less than 1h50 that it lasts. Although I had enjoyed watching TNMT anime when I was adolescent, I've never been a hardcore fan and it is true that I cannot spot any of the traits that other purists criticized about. What I certainly know is that it was a nice combination of Transformers/Batman/Martial-art material based on a plot that seemed solid and justified. Megan-April was more Megan than April, but she is the right actress for that sort of character. She is not the true red-hair girl I would prefer to see, but she is not less successful than fake blonde J.Alba in Fantastic4, or fake-redhead Scarlett J. in the Avengers. She has the right age and overall stature for the role and she is always fun to watch.The turtles were very versatile and realistic in all ways and I liked that each one got an emphasized ability (or weakness!), differentiating from the anime where all looked quite the same.The action sequences were mind-blowing, synchronized at the ultimate speed the human eye can perceive them. Unlike transformers and other movies where the action and fight are so messy, shaken and difficult to follow that you wished to just skip forward to the outcome, in this case it is absorbing, spectacular and humorous. Which is what all TNMT productions are really about.The music, production design, voices and sound are exactly as they should be to throw you into the screen.It might not be a 10, but in front of all those purists destroying franchises, 10 is the least I could give to hope for at least 2 sequels. And I don't mind who ever purist out there may just avoid it.Don't miss it!",positive
Ender's Game,"Visually stunning, well performed, but my oh my. As a small example, Ender's emails home to his sister, with whom he has a string emotional rapport and which he reads aloud, read like a dry, cold shopping list of what's just happened and what's about to happen. Like so much of the dialogue, they serve the purpose of informing the audience, and *no effort whatsoever* has been made to make it fit in with the story. It's so unbelievably appalling it actually makes you feel like the makers have a personal grudge against their audience. What's more, the movie is brimmed with premises that make no sense - and it relies heavily on these to function. For example, the essential premise that the Formic's ""can't talk"" and so humanity has never attempted communication - yet they a have huge, industrial-sized and highly technical army, that invades far-off planets - so it's clear to everyone from the start that unless they spontaneously do the same thing at the same time, then it's obvious they communicate with one another, and have done so for thousands of years. I'm not kidding - the notion that they communicate *at all* only occurs to Ender right at the end of the movie, in a somewhat forced scene that was thrown in to make the end make sense - and this fact, or the failure of mankind to realise it, is absolutely pivotal to the plot! His commander even denies out loud that it's possible for Formics to communicate - fifty years *after* they launched an invasion on planet earth!Equally bizarrely, the Formics' motivation for invading Earth is that they are about to ""breed themselves into extinction"" (sic). I can barely imagine how lazy and ignorant you have to be to surmise that because overpopulation = bad, therefore overpopulation = extinction. Give it half a moment's thought, heck, even do a little cursory research - it's just not a bright conclusion to reach, is it?Throw in some really uncomfortable lines - you know the ones - establish a strong character for Ben Kingsley (he always shines at these, I think rather he established it for himself) , then give him some throwaway line that serves no purpose except to inform the audience what's going on (again)... oh God, stop it, it hurts!As the final image faded to credits, I actually muttered ""f*** you"" under my breath, because that's truly how I felt. Kind of violated.Do yourself, and the film medium, a favour - TAKE YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE",negative
Ender's Game,"Science fiction started life around the Enlightenment as a conduit for debates about society, about morals and about what makes us human, and what the future might hold, maintaining that same role as our science and technology advanced exponentially over the centuries. Then came its poorer sibling, the sci-fi that was just about the thrills and spills and the effects and action only. The best science fiction of course is a fine blend of the two, of the cerebral and the visceral.One such novel was ""Enders Game"" by the Orson Scott Card, which used the familiar sci-fi cliché of the alien invasion of Earth and the pan- national fight back to examine a very real but troubling dilemma which affects any nation that considers itself to be ""modern"" and ""civilized"", which is that often in order to protect those very things, we, or those entrusted to defend us, have to embrace the opposite of all our values. The young men and women we take and train to kill without hesitation and mercy, to risk death and injury while taking life, then expecting them to return home and be normal. But to abandon that duty of defence may leave our values and our futures at stake, and so by doing nothing lose everything. Is there even a correct answer to this conundrum, and if not then how can we handle the conflict that arises?After many years as ""an unfilmable novel"" it finally arrives as an impressive medium budget movie. Director Gavin Hood, who helmed the mess that was ""X-Men origins: Wolverine"" 4 years ago redeems himself on the sci-fi front by delivering a film that is at once spectacular looking and narratively flowing and gripping, while at the same time not flinching from the dark, sombre heart of the story.The plot takes place 50 years after a devastating attack on Earth by highly evolved Ants called ""Formics"" who were looking for new colonies to deal with their chronic over-population, an invasion repulsed thanks to an ""ID4"" style manoeuvre by legendary pilot Mazer Rackham. What was left of us evolved into a highly advanced, but highly militarised society with interstellar capability and fleets of high tech space cruisers. The military realised that the best minds for strategy where those of children, who were gifted in intuition and daring thought lost in conventional upbringings, and so train the young at tough military academies, selecting the best for officer command. The brightest star is young Ender Wiggin (""Hugo""s Asa Butterfield) who is targeted by chillingly utilitarian General Graff (Harrison Ford) who subjects him to often horrifying mind games, putting him into conflicts with the other cadets around him, isolating him and putting his back ever further to the wall. The only one to help is psychologist Anderson (Viola Davis) who knows that she is complicit in the warping and destruction of the souls of children even if it is to a greater good. He makes enemies but also friends, chief among which is Petra (Hailee Steinfield) When he shows brilliance at the zero gravity team war games, a fight with another cadet ends in tragedy and Ender turns his back on everything, being especially conflicted by the fact that his unique understanding of Formic thought and culture makes him empathise with the very ones he is to destroy. Using his beloved sister Valentine (Abigail Breslin) as leverage, Ender is given command of a fleet positioned off the Formic homeworld, with Petra and his friends as his team, where a massive military build-up is terrifying the veteran top brass into a strategy of all out aggression. Here he is taken under the wing of Mazer Rackham (Ben Kingsley) himself. As the big attack on Formica approaches, Ender begins to feel some of the Formics are trying to communicate with him telepathically. Can peace prevail, or can only one race be left standing? And even if they win, what will be left of the soul of Ender and his team at the end of it?The special effects are impressive, even if most of the ""big battle"" stuff is in the trailer. The excellent cast all do justice to their characters and their struggles, and every part from the major to the minor are well filled and directed. The film also updates the sentiments to our current world, not hiding the obvious fact that we are all living out this dilemma right now but without giving simple answers. ""Star Trek"", which was the modern home of ethical dilemma sci-fi, attempted to grapple with similar questions in this summer's ""reboot"" instalment ""Star Trek into the Darkness"", yet did so with all the clumsiness, lack of skill and tracing paper thin profundity typical of what now calls itself ""Star Trek"". This film on the other hand treats it as the REAL series that Gene Rodenberry created would have. It also evokes thoughts of some of the higher end Japanese Manga and Anime, who use a similar set up and youthful military elite in their dark, ethically troubled tales.Not the fun, exciting happy go lucky movie for kids that some of the marketing suggests, it is instead a deep, warm, troubling, thrilling, moving, spectacular film that is suitable both for adults (despite the juvenile cast) and for teenagers and children (8+) who will hopefully be introduced to the ideas and questions it raises, and will find themselves stimulated to form their own answers, as they must inevitably do some day.",positive
Paradise Hills,"I thought the movie had some creepy moments and overall tries to build a feeling of mystery. But the ending was just terrible. We didn't see it coming and it made me angry. Wait for this one at Redbox, trust me. Save that movie theater money for something better.",negative
Paradise Hills,"This movie was very pretty to look at, but beneath it the plot was very simple. A young woman named Uma ( Emma Roberts) doesn't want to marry the guy who led to her Father's suicide so her fiance and mother send her to an island to correct her defiance and make her more obedient. She meets other young women too who families and associates send them there to mold them into their image. Arnama (Gonzales),a pop star,who wants to control her music. An obese woman named Chloe (McDonald) whose family want her to be skinner. An Asian woman named Yu (Awkwafina) who family want her to act proper or faces being disowned. She also has a cute love interest named Markus (Jeremy Irvine) who conveniently gets a job on the island. And of course Milla Jovovich as The Duchess is very beautiful. Yet it's pretty to look at but there's nothing there but feminist propaganda, LBGT agenda, toxic masculinity, and other SJW tropes. It's a simple movie about rich women feeling forced to be someone they're not, so their families send them there to be rehabilitated. Whether their families know it's a program to study their loved ones mannerisms so poor young woman can get plastic surgery to look exactly like them and replace them in their individual lives. And after the ladies are done been studied and having their identity stolen, The Duchess turns out to be an evil snake or succubus who eats them. Why I don't know since everything gets reveal in the last twenty minutes with no explanation. Markus turns out to be the bad guy and a part of the scheme because he's weak and a man. Arnama is hinted to have feelings for Uma and this is confirmed when Arnama kisses Uma goodbye on her final night on the island. Every man except Uma's dead father is bad in this movie. Markus did one redeeming good thing and that's it. The deaths of two of the children were dumb. If Uma and Chloe's process were complete and they were still alive, why not just wait until they were finish processing Yu? And Uma was so busy looking around and staring at a dead Arnama that she literally let Chloe die? The Duchess' death and reveal was so anticlimactic and ridiculous. Yet, the final scene was a nice reward after the confusing opening scene. I also like the nice twist on classicsm with their replacements. It wasn't a horrible movie but it was kinda all over the place and the third act could've been more interesting but it seemed rushed through. Wasn't a horrible movie but it could have been better. Overall, a pretty movie to look at about a not so far off dystopian world about affluent women being copied, killed off, and being replaced into their loved one's ideal version of them.",positive
The Room,"What would you do if you found a house with a room that can create anything in the world you desire? If you are a logical meticulous person, things would go as follow... Step 1. Discover the parameters of how it works: What it can create, if it can be brought outside, if it gets destroyed outside the room, how long does it last and what happens if you create things that have an online presence? Can you create a pendrive with next year's best seller? Can you create a new room in the house? These are just a few essential things you would have to know. Step 2. Live your best life, work to survive... because unless you can create diamonds that last outside the house and sell them, it is not an income source and you need to eat. Step 3. Decorate your house, create a ps4, dunno, things that enable you to do things and that you don't need to bring outside your home. Because for as long as you keep them inside, they will last forever. Step 4. Have a family, create millions of millions of dollars and hopefully, when you die, those will become real for your heirs or something (if we apply what they said in the movie and the creator's death makes someone created in the house survive outside, maybe objects will survive too).
Now, if you are a stupid person, create something that lives, even worse, create a person and things will go down like the movie. Ruin your life, your marriage and maybe leave you with huge issues for the future. The best way to thwart what could have been an awesome life full of trips to the ocean, to the forest and who knows where at your finger tips is indeed, to make it a living hell all on your own.

Extinction,"I read a few reviews people complaining about the 'twist' and thus I didn't know what to expect. I had seen the trailer and found it interesting, curious, and was impressed with the visuals but hesitant with Michael Peña's acting, but still decided to see this film.From the start, everything was on point - the directing, editing, visuals, cinematography, score and story all held my interest quite well. I was really impressed with the modern/futuristic sets. I felt some of the SFX (i.e. some of the CGI explosions) could have been better, but still adequate. The pacing felt a little slow, but started to make sense towards the end. But initially I was not impressed with Michael Peña's acting, I felt he was being lazy and struggling with his character, as was Lizzy Caplan. I kept thinking to myself that the two children where much better actors - until the 'twist' happened. Only then did everything fall into place and I understood the two lead characters performances (I don't want to give anything away) and was blown away by the brilliant concept.Finally, a sci-fi with something uniquely different and refreshing that was produced exceptionally well. I am truly blown away as almost an hour has passed and I can't get this film out of my mind and certainly want to see it again. My only critique was that I felt the story could have been tighter. I usually complain that a film is too long but for the first time, I'm complaining that I wanted it longer with more in-depth details of the back story.I get the wanna be critics slamming this film (mostly for stupid and infantile reasons), but am shocked that the real critics didn't see the brilliance this film had.I really hope the producers ignore the negativity and come out with a sequel, as this film is certainly a contender for a cult following status for the true and real sci-fi fanatics such as myself. Bravo to the entire production team and especially the writers for creating this little brilliant gem of a concept and executing it into a remarkable film.Even though at first you may think, there are no let downs in this film, only pleasant surprises if you're patient. A well deserved 9/10 from me. Please create a sequel!",positive
The Purge: Anarchy,"Murder is legal during the night of the ""Purge"". Most serial killers are law abiding citizens, just pathetic wannabes. Thanks to the ""Purge"" they can finally live their dream and kill, kill, kill. But there are like-minded souls roaming the streets and a better armed group or a sneaky sniper can stop the nicest killing spree. This is total war, like Verdun, and even the toughest soldiers hated Verdun. So actually only total nut-cases with a death wish would participate in the ""Purge"". Additionally, killing someone you know will make you the prime target of his friends and relatives, it's not ""purging"", it's stirring things up.The first ""Purge""-movie was just a run-of-the-mill home-invasion thriller with a strange background story. The second installment is supposed to flesh out the original concept, except it doesn't, because, well, it really is a very stupid idea. There are a few psychopaths killing the homeless and each other. But the main ""Purge"" participants are: a) Soldiers, sent by the white, Christian fundamentalist government to raise the disappointing ""Purge"" death toll. b) Mercenaries kidnapping random people, so rich, Christian fundamentalist whites can kill them in a save setting. c) Black revolutionaries that fight both groups and save their brothers & sisters. If the main character would have been black, constantly spouting ethnic slurs against whites, it would have been just like the blaxploitation movies from the 1970s. This will doubtlessly happen in part 3, when the revolutionary leader ""The Stranger"" will turn into a ""Shaft""-like savior.Why do people like this hateful and hypocritical trash? Is it a splendid satire on social trends happening in today's USA? Au contraire. If the really rich would want to get rid of the poor, they would start with ending the illegal mass immigration. But instead - of course - they do promote it. No administration likes heavily armed citizens. They want control, not anarchy, no ""Guns are out new gods""-nonsense. Crime is great. If you treat it in a very liberal way, it will flourish until the people will demand all the right things: the abolition of cash, a snoopier and more intrusive police, stricter gun control laws (for non-criminals) ...Is it ""thought-provoking""? Yes, everything that annoying is.Is it a ""gripping suspense thriller""? If you manage to evade the provoked thoughts, you might enjoy the ride. I actually considered part 1 to be a silly, but quite suspenseful ""Assault on Precinct 13""-version. Due to the sheer amount of stupidity in part 2, this time around I wasn't quite up to the challenge, it didn't amuse me at all.250 years ago a prejudice purported that somebody without god would just pillage and murder. As it turned out, there is no such correlation. The ""Purge"" says that without governmental control and persecution people would just pillage and murder. Again: not true. Except for those few poor souls who aren't, we, the people, are much better than that.",negative
The Purge: Anarchy,"How could a sequel to a film that was released exactly one year ago be any good? This was the question I asked myself as I tiredly sat in line pondering whether I should just go home and wait till at the very least, it's theatrical release. Especially considering the first Purge was somewhat of a let down for me. I guess it's because the first one was purely exciting and terrifying because the idea was so perverse. It was the idea that really sold the tickets, but the film itself, seemed to not deliver to the expectations. After watching The Purge: Anarchy, it became very clear why.In the first film, we were sold by all the trailers, which successfully put the idea in our heads, leaving us brainwashed and nightmare-ring about ""what would I do?"" The first film focused on a wealthy neighborhood and a wealthy family with an unlimited supply of resources. A storyline showcasing that all the money in the world couldn't protect them from The Purge But in all honestly, could the average horror viewer relate to that situation or anyone for that matter?This is where the sequel comes in to blow the roof off the first film. Where the first film failed, Purge: Anarchy not only resolves, but also opens up a whole new realm of fear I had not strung together under the circumstances. The sequel puts into perspective the idea of what the purge would look like from multiple story lines that are not only realistic and relatable but are nonstop and completely unpredictable. I was on the edge of my seat the entire film, beginning to end. Very rarely do I get scared once a movie is over, but I was a hot mess on the way home especially coming down from the adrenaline high from being visually anxious for almost 2 hours straight!There were so many things I loved about this film. The characters were all very well written, most of which were wildcards and constantly keeping the audience guessing. I was incredibly impressed that the film knew how to be violent without being gratuitous. There were so many scenes that could have easily been bloody and gross, but they kept it conservative enough that it made you rely on your imagination, which often made the film much more horrifying in my opinion.It's been some time since I got this excited over a film in the theater but I really can't say a single bad thing about this incredible thrill- ride. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND seeing this film ASAP! The sound of that machine gun still haunts me 2 weeks later GO SEE IT NOW!",positive
RoboCop,"I just came across a collection of past and present pop culture characters on a social media site and thought to myself ""Wow, there was a Robocob reboot? In 2014? How could I have missed this?"" The thing is, I didn't miss it. When I watched the trailer just now on imdb, I vaguely recalled some of the scenes about two thirds in. And isn't that really all you need to know about this remake?",negative
RoboCop,"Full disclosure: the original Robocop is among my top 5 favorite films of all time, and I've easily watched it over 200 times. With that being said, I still looked forward to this re-interpretation due to my love of the character (whose legacy had already been profoundly tarnished by the redundant first sequel and catastrophically misguided second sequel) and my admiration of director Jose Padilha's ""Elite Squad"" films (as well as his documentaries). Suffice to say, I came into the theater with a bias toward wanting the film to succeed.I'm willing to acknowledge that it may be for this reason that I found this film to be a resounding (if slightly flawed) success. Conversely, it is my belief that a large contingent of overzealous ""fans"" were hellbent on seeing this film fail, therefore had pre-determined that the movie was trash. How could it possibly withstand several years of unwavering hatred during its production and be given a fair shot? Judging by the middling 6.7 IMDb rating and the 50% Rotten Tomatoes score, many people loathed the film just as much as they'd hoped they would.This viewer simply cannot accept that Robocop 2014 is anywhere near as bad as people are rating it. For starters, the film has been bashed mercilessly for idiotically trivial elements such as ""His hand is human!"", ""His suit is black!"", or worst of all, ""I refuse to support a PG-13 version of Robocop"". It is my firm belief that all of these criticisms are merely the ravings of closed-minded fanboys who are (bizarrely) searching for the next movie to ""ruin their childhood"". It's a phenomenon that is baffling and absurd. Anyway, I rated the film 10/10 on IMDb because I wanted the score to weigh heavier in the positive direction. Truth be told, I think the film is a solid 8 and may even grow to become a 9 over time. Of course it's not as good as Verhoeven's classic, and obviously it's much different in tone. For that I am grateful -- part 2 tried so desperately to ape the original that it felt like a rather soulless carbon copy (albeit a copy salvaged somewhat by spectacular stop-motion effects and a great villain in Tom Noonan's ""Cain""). I didn't want another movie trying to mimic the satire of the original, nor did I feel that anyone could ever one-up the hyper-violence of the 1987 version, so why try?There are those that argue that this film should have simply been called something else other than Robocop if it wanted to be so different, and I get that...except the bottom line is few studios will ever greenlight a $120 million dollar film without some kind of name recognition. It's a sad truth. But in utilizing the Robocop brand name, Padilha was given the funding to acquire a brilliant cast and design cutting edge digital effects. In my opinion, a little brand recognition is a fair trade off if it helps the film achieve the look and feel of a high-end sci-fi blockbuster.Anyway, I've already babbled several paragraphs longer than I'd intended. The bottom line is you should abandon your preconceptions and watch the movie for what it is: a genuinely smart, heartfelt and wonderfully acted sci-fi featuring characters we know and love. What's so awful about that?",positive
Child's Play,"This movie is 100% garbage.I was willing to watch it even though the doll looked terrible and the trailer was so-so. I knew not to expect ""Chucky"" but more of an AI gone wrong. I also had seen plenty of negative reviews, so my standards were pretty low.I thought that guaranteed at least somewhat of a good time. When you expect nothing you can't be disappointed, right? Wrong.The movie is everything I hate about bad horror movies:1. Gore replaces originality. You get over the top scenes of gore that are so tonally off with the rest of the movie.2. Dialogue was written by a toddler. It's so generic and amateurish even for a kid's movie it would insult the kid's intelligence. That's how low it is.3. Character act unrealistically. They find dead bodies and just move on like nothing happened. No real reaction. No trauma. No long term effects.4. Another movie that needlessly adds a ""cast of kids"" to ride the wave of Stranger Things. Only these kids are generic, flat, and have zero story or any kind of objective want/need to drive their stories. They are just tools. Boring ones.5. Chucky is a mess. He sounds ridiculous. He's not funny. He's not cute. He's certainly not threatening.6. Humor is bad. Oh, plenty of laughs, but mostly at how absurd and ridiculous it was. The actual jokes rarely landed.7. The storyline is just bad. It's a paint-by-numbers story that is still off. I'm used to barely there plotlines as a horror lover. But when it's barely there, and still patchy, I can't stand it. How do you ruin ""generic"". It's generic for a reason.8. Chucky has no personality. None whatsoever. He just repeats and mimics and then randomly kills to be Andy's friend.9. Andy and Chucky share very few scenes prior to the killing, yet andy act very emotional when chucky needs to be put down. It was just so emotionally unrealistic. He seemed more disturbed by shutting down a doll he had for 2 seconds than finding the ripped off face of a human being.I don't mind bad horror movies. I do mind stupid ones that don't make sense. That are generic, and still inconsistent, and pointless.I can't think of a single positive thing about this movie. Even the acting as very basic, and not at all good.",negative

The problem is that it shows people going to retail toy stores, which, as of 2019, are almost non-existent anymore! It has all the family and friendship cliches that are typical of modern movies. The violence often gets toned down, by changing camera angles so you can't see most of the violence. When you do see it, it is either too dark to make out, or happens too fast to get more than a brief blip of it.

Isle of Dogs,"""Isle of Dogs"" (PG-13, 1:41) is a stop-motion animated adventure comedy directed and written by multiple Oscar-nominated auteur Wes Anderson and realized in his distinctive quirky style and with his usual stable of all-star talent. Anderson is best known for films like ""Rushmore"" (1998), ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (2001), ""Moonrise Kingdom"" (2012) and his Best Picture Oscar-nominated ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" (2014), but this isn't Anderson's first animated project. 2009's ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" (also a stop-motion animated comedy) received an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature. Typically unusual and eclectic, Anderson has said that ""Isle of Dogs"" is inspired both by the 1960s and 70s holiday specials produced by Rankin/Bass - and the films of legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa.In the near future, Japan's people are concerned about an overabundance of stray dogs - and the possibility of a rampant canine flu affecting humans. The leader of Megasaki City, Mayor Kobayashi (voiced by Kunichi Nomura), who comes from a long line of cat lovers, signs an order banishing all dogs to Trash Island, starting with Spots (Liev Schreiber), the pet and guardian of the Mayor's orphaned nephew and ward, 12-year-old Atari Kobayashi (Koyu Rankin). Atari then steals an airplane and crash lands (with only minor injuries) on Trash Island when he is discovered and helped by a self-proclaimed ""pack of scary, indestructible alpha dogs"", led by the human-averse Chief (Bryan Cranston) and including the more timid Rex (Edward Norton), King (Bob Balaban), Boss (Bill Murray) and Duke (Jeff Goldblum). As those five dogs fight off other dogs for territory - and some humans sent to retrieve Atari - and then lead him on a dangerous and uncertain cross-island odyssey trying to find Spots (if he's even still alive), there's a lot happening back in Megasaki City. A scientist called Professor Watanabe (Arika Ito), who has an assistant named Yoko Ono (voiced by Yoko Ono), claims that he's perfecting a cure for the dog flu, but the powers-that-be aren't interested (to say the least). Meanwhile, an American exchange student named Tracy Walker (Greta Gerwig), who stands with the city's dog lovers, develops a fascination with Atari's story (as reported on the news) - and an obsession with uncovering what's really going on.""Isle of Dogs"" is creative and attractive, but not very enjoyable. It has Anderson's trademark adorable quirkiness, but the plot is so far-fetched (no pun intended) and irrelevant to anything going on in the world that the whole thing feels like a pretty pointless exercise. Limited cuteness - and quirkiness just for quirkiness' sake - is of limited entertainment value. ""C-""",negative
Isle of Dogs,"I had very high expectations going into Isle of Dogs, being a great admirer of Wes Anderson's work, and especially off the fumes of his previous film, The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). If you look at Wes' filmography, you will notice that each of his films progressively become more focused, detailed, and ""Wes Anderson-ey"". It feels as if his films have been building to a culmination of sorts, which can be represented with Isle of Dogs.The story revolves around a young boy, Atari, who is seeking his lost dog with help from a pack of dogs on Trash Island, right outside of Megasaki City (word-play on Nagasaki), a fictional future city of Japan that is exiling dogs due to a ""canine flu"" outbreak.From a filmmaking viewpoint, Isle of Dogs has it all in spades, and more. The characters are well rounded and relatable, even though the majority of them are dogs. The presentation of the story is very fresh and unique, and the humor is always smoothly intertwined with the narrative and visuals. With a runtime of an hour and 40 minutes, it flies by, always keeping your attention and further engaging you. The stop-motion animation is very well done, and the way it is contrasted with beautiful Japanese imagery is stunning. The soundtrack is also excellent, and aids in telling the story. There are many nods towards Japanese cinema, chiefly Akira Kurosawa's films, which you can tell that Wes has a passion for. The voice cast is star-studded and wonderful as always. There are plenty of twists and surprises, and the film leaves the viewers with some important messages/themes to ponder over. It is best to go into the movie knowing as little about the story as possible, and let it take you on its journey.This film will greatly reward repeat viewings. The attention to detail in every frame is incredible, and there is always so much on the screen to absorb and process, in the best way possible. I believe that Wes Anderson has the most distinct and easily discernible style of any filmmaker to ever live, and this quality alone is something to be praised very highly.If you love dogs, Japanese cinema/culture, stop-motion, and animation in general, then you will love this film all the more so. Isle of Dogs, shows Wes at his full unfiltered creative power, stretching his capabilities, and giving us something truly remarkable.Ineffable Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls052767730/",positive
Allegiant,"I am trying to keep from falling asleep from this boring, stupid, stupid, did I say stupid movie. Asinine, ridiculous, this movie could be renamed, ""How to bore your audience to death"" or ""Movie for braindead corpses"". I feel stupid for watching this so called 'movie'. And I am watching it for free and I still want my money back. Terrorist groups don't need any old torture devices, they can use this movie. Bad acting, check. Stupid plot line, check. Very big, gigantic plot holes that make absolutely no sense, check. You don't care if everyone in the movie does a horrible, painful death, check. Through out the movie you will roll your eyes, sigh heavenly, saying things like ""Why are they doing that?"" and ""That makes no sense."", check. **Spoilers, you knew the one chick was going to die when they got on top of the wall. No bullets hit Tris or Four although they were being shot at at close range and with machine guns, and they didn't get shot as they climbed up the wall. Despite the land outside the wall being completely jacked up from nuclear war, the land is completely toxic, yet people are able to survive on the fridges in tents!!!Where were they getting food and water!!! These people are supposedly exposed to all kinds of toxic fumes, toxic land but they all look normal!!!? Oh, but the Genetic Manipulation place was able to survive the nuclear fall out and create a grass growing (again ON WHAT IF THE WHOLE WORLD IIS A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST!!!) And the motivations for the characters, stupid, stupid, stupid. David, who you KNEW and the new section were evil. Absolutely nothing shocking. You knew who was going to die, you knew who was evil. And why did Four go back to Chicago? And how did he survive walking through the nuclear wasteland with no issues!!

Finding an actual good these days is like trying to find the holy Grail or a needle in a haystack.",negative
Allegiant,"Upon seeing Allegiant, I had mixed feelings about it. At first upon seeing the reviews I was a little in shocked at how much criticism it was receiving, but sometimes your opinion can be different from the critics who review the movie. So I saw the movie, and as I watched the movie I started remembering scenes from the book, since I haven't read the book in a while. There was scenes that surprise me, which I thoroughly enjoyed because I love surprises. And although, yes the movie strays away from the source material, we as people should be more open-minded about book to film adaptations. As a fan of the books it can be nerve wrecking to have a good book turned into an awful movie, but I like to think about how much time was put into making a film. An actor/actress works hard to follow the script that is given to them, the director has a vision in mind for the film, which is hard work in itself. And putting the film together takes a lot of shots to achieve in the amount of time they are given. This is why we have deleted scenes to begin with. I praise this cast for not giving up on this project and continue to do their best to pull off a movie adaptation of a best- selling series.All in all, I enjoyed this movie and recommend it to people who love stories and fans who can still appreciate a movie despite its obvious changes.",positive

A Cure for Wellness,"I was really excited about this movie when the trailer came out, I could not wait to see it. But after reading multiple bad comments about the film, I got worried.But I must say, nothing to worry about. The movie is kinda weird maybe, but if you watch the trailer you know what you're settling in for, I suppose. The story develops itself kinda slow, but that didn't bother me cause I was intrigued by the story. The movie has good actors, a great setting and atmosphere. It kinda reminded me of Shutter Island, I think because of the whole ""mystery island with a weird cure-institution""-thing.",positive
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,"I will preface this by saying that I have not read the books. I did see the first movie and actually enjoyed it. I usually watch movies such as this with a skeptic mind and the first one wasn't bad. This movie, however, was terrible. (Heavy spoilers roasting over an open fire to follow)I've heard that the movie deviates almost unforgivably from the book. If that's the case, I can't speak for the book but the movie script looks to have been written by a high-schooler, at best. The movie is riddled with clichés: Main character with a dark inner battle raging due to prior decisions made (boring!). People (and armies) showing up just at the perfect time (forgivable once, not around the 5th time). Bad guys who couldn't hit a target 20 feet in front of them while shooting an automatic weapon (man those guys suck). And the ultimate ""faked death with poison/paralysis"" scene (wow that whole scene was bad). Throughout the whole movie the main character (the annoying tom-boy girl), Tris, keeps being painted as ""tough"" and ""deadly"". She is neither of these. In fact, she is quite laughably the opposite. Could her personal trainers not put her through some weight-training classes? (Her hairstylist was definitely present as her hair looked like she just stepped out of a Hollywood salon right after the scene where she cut her OWN hair with a pair of rusty scissors....) It looks like she couldn't even do 10 push ups yet she was fighting people and saving people falling over ledges with ease. But she looks like a huge wuss! Her little girly grunts and squeals she made when fighting or doing ""action"" made me bust out laughing. And the scene where she breaks through the glass is meant to be bad-ass and instead just left me hoping she would bounce off the glass and fall flat on her back (man, I wanted to laugh so bad). And probably the most unforgivable part of this whole movie was how POINTLESS everything was. Examples: They fight the faction-less on the train, killing several and doing serious damage to many more (not really sure how because Tris fights like a sissy girl). Then the main character, Four, says his own name and the leader of the vagabonds through bloodied teeth is like, ""Oh we cool bro. Never mind you just head-butted me in the face and killed my friends."" (the Hell??) (Oh and Tris's brother is a huge pussy). They continue to fight hard and kill people to narrowly escape the perfectly- uniformed drone guards of the ""capital"" so that they can go in to hiding. Then the main character just gives herself up. I think it was because the villain was threatening to kill innocent people with her mind control devices (never seen that before), but it doesn't really matter. Then she's given the chance to escape by her double- double crossing 'friend' (didn't see that coming) and yet she chooses to stay to open the mystery divergent box. Well what was the point of anything if you wanted to open it anyway??! I was DYING to contain my frustration. (also, how does the evil capital lady have this perfectly built divergent-box-opening proprietary chamber system, complete with bulletproof glass and mystery-box holding pedestal, just already set up? Does no one question this stuff???)And to top it all off, the super-secret, must-be-preserved-at-all- costs message in the box, (the ENTIRE point of the movie): ""Divergents are cool, don't ostracize them. Oh, and the rest of humanity is living outside the wall. Cheers."" What? No one has bothered to check this whole time?????? Gag.Enough roasting. To conclude, lots of movies, even good ones, have clichés and information that you are just supposed to assume. But this movie was genuinely terrible. Maybe all the people reviewing this with an 7/10+ saw a different movie than I did.",negative
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,"Oh dear god why'd I go see this movie?! If I wanted Hunger Games: Catching Fire, I should've went to see Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Wait! No, I take that back. If I wanted Hunger Games, I should've watched Battle Royale 2.Cause if I'm honest, this movie is a copycat of a copycat. Oh how I miss the good old days! The good old days where if you went to see a movie set in a dystopian future where a corrupt government put its citizenry in peril on a whim, it was rated R because it contained great special effects, gritty foul language laced dialogue, and contained adult themes. But this! Okay! I understand the concept of movie studios dumbing this type of film down so tweens can partake in something that makes them feel like they are cool, or makes them feel like their rebelling.Even though they aren't really, they're just soaking up things that have been rehashed from what was cool 25+ years ago.

The Giver,"I shall start this review with the staple comment. I loved the book. This movie is awful. And I don't mean ""they changed a couple of things and now I feel it is true to the original"". I mean, they changed a lot, including the subtext, it has internal inconsistencies, and it is no longer the same story. I couldn't even stay to finish the movie, and below I will state where I departed. For this reason, I give it the score as low as possible. Please don't continue reading if you do not wish to be exposed to the spoilers below. To start things off, what is the first colour that Jonas sees in the book? Red, he sees a red apple. A little bit into the story, after they have described the setting of the community to help people understand what the world is like. A description they have skipped over in the movie, they just show funny shaped houses, funny shaped bikes and a futuristic community. Weird. And Jonas ""always knew he was different"" since he has been seeing green tree leaves... Well, that is a departure from the original. Not ruinous, until he then sees Fiona's hair and gets all moon-eyed at her. The impending love story crushes my hopes. Then, they skip RIGHT to the graduation ceremony and kind of blur over the sheer doldrums of the event, with a witty joke told by the Chief Elder who LIES to them, although she immediately comes clean. So lies aren't allowed except with humorous exceptions... Oh, and Asher the best friend is now a drone pilot, so that will explain how he and Jonas will fight for the girl, even though Asher has no feelings, so the jealousy he keeps showing is... well, impossible, but definitely present. The Giver starts sharing with Jonas (thankfully, the sled is the first memory) they choose to omit the poignant fact that the giving removes the memories from the Giver, so only the new Keeper has them. Then, as Jonas gets more memories, he tries to share them with the girl he is falling in love with... wait, that didn't happen and if it had, as a drone of the society, she would have turned him in. He also shares things with his sister and Gabe sleeps in her room because nobody realizes Jonas can calm him. The Chief Elder sees some of these interactions and becomes paranoid that Jonas is also reacting to the sharing of memories, just like Rosemary (who is now the daughter of the Chief Elder and the Giver). OK, I can go on and on, but I will skip ahead to where I had to leave the theatre. The Chief Elder sends her military police force after Jonas, then after the Keeper, whom they zap with their batons, something that shouldn't be acceptable in their anti- violence and war society and here is about where I left, as the Chief Elder directs Asher to fly a drone after Jonas to ""lose"" him, which seems an odd colloquialism for ""gone elsewhere"" that the story has used to that point. So all in all, the society eschews war, but not the chief elder (somehow), feelings abound even on the feeling dampening drugs the society takes, and people are fine with violence from the military police. Not the story of struggle against a world so absorbed in being the same that feeling and being different are something to hide until one can escape to freedom outside the community. It is now a horrible love story, a horrible love triangle, and a story of a mother who hates the father of the child she lost. What a garbage rendition. They should have let any of the other films with these plots continue to tell them instead of corrupting this story to the point of unrecognizability.",negative
The Giver,"I have seen reviews comparing the Giver (unfavorably) to other teen dystopian movies like Divergent and Hunger Games. That's actually a compliment, the Giver is not more of the same stuff, The critics seemingly can't accept that people are smart enough to get the point of Lois Lowry's book, and that people aren't smart enough to enjoy, much less understand, a character study and a societal study. Mindless action, needless violence, and transforming robots are all absent here. I have a feeling though, that people are smarter than they think. The book has been popular for at least 30 years, why would people balk at the movie adaptation? The Giver is a project that has been in the back of every movie maker's mind for years, now it's here. Go see it and judge for yourself.",positive
Despicable Me 3,"Despicable Me 3This movie was weighed down by a lot of problems, but before I get to that I will say that I did not hate this film by any means, it's just not very good.Problems:1. The whole ""brother"" concept is good, but it shouldn't have been set up in this movie. It should have been set up in the first one, or the end of the second at the latest.2. This problem I refer to as ""the politics of film,"" because the studio did not acknowledge that they are going to far with this series. The minions stole the show in the first one, however the studio kept pushing it on audiences by over-commercializing them. They somehow became the face of Illumination Studios, and they somehow managed to get their own unnecessary origin story movie. Universal should've stopped while they were ahead with the first Despicable Me. 3. I do not like it when a series will reuse jokes, in this case the ""unicorn being so fluffy I'm going to die."" It was funny in the first one, but in this one it felt forced.4. The villain, Balthazar Bratt, felt way too underdeveloped. He got about four minutes of an origin, which resulted in vague motivations and just another generic, one-off villain.Overall: Save yourself from this mess",negative
Despicable Me 3,"The first two films were exceptional, and were always going to be a tough act to follow, but I thought they were followed particularly well with this one. It was huge fun, wonderfully over the top, great laughs for kids and adults. A bonkers plot which was loaded with jokes, and the introduction of his brother provided most of the laughs, the Minions were great fun as usual. Very touching at times too. I've read a forth is in the pipeline, I wonder if that will be it, they've been great. 8/10",positive

How It Ends,"I watched this BECAUSE of all the bad reviews, not despite them. I've often found that my tastes aren't in lockstep with the ""blockbuster"" crowd. And I was not disappointedwith my instincts on this film after reading several IMDB reviews.
Everyone has a different idea of what a movie should be. This one is NOT a typical ""end of times"" movie. It doesn't lay out exactly what is happening as it happens, bringing with it what I saw as a more realistic perspective of how things might be in such times.... no communications, no power, sudden chaos. We don't know any more than the characters do... just as it would be.
If you're looking for a beginning with ""once upon a time"" and an ending of ""and they lived happily ever after"", then move on.",positive
The Cloverfield Paradox,"Well, maybe I didn't have very high expectations or my inner cynic has taken a holiday, but unlike the bulk of critics and reviewers here I found this to be a perfectly serviceable piece of pulpy sci-fi/horror entertainment. It's no '2001', granted, but it's a very good looking film with nice visual effects - especially considering the budget - with solid performances by a talented cast, and it doesn't bore you for a second. I'm willing to bet most genre geeks like me (by which I mean people who have a soft spot in their heart for any halfway decent looking sci-fi or horror B-movie), would describe this film as fun.And while admittedly about as scientifically credible as a superhero movie, it's not quite as dumb and far-fetched as many of the most scathing reviewers seem to think it is. What quite a few people apparently didn't get is that 'The Cloverfield Paradox' riffs on the very real hysteria that broke out a couple of years ago when the CERN in Geneva (Switzerland) conducted an experiment to find the Higgs Boson (aka the ""God Particle"" - which incidentally was also the film's original title.) The CERN scientists hoped to find the God Particle by simulating conditions in the Large Hadron Collider - the most powerful particle accelerator on Earth - that were supposedly similar to those in the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang.A lot of people worldwide got scared shîtless by that idea, because they thought such a simulation could have unpredictable and possibly catastrophic consequences, and a couple of scientists even tried to stop the experiment by filing a case to the European Human Rights Court. The wildest theories started popping up in the media, like the experiment would cause black holes that would suck up Earth or open doors into other dimensions; heck: even a portal to Hell was considered a possibility, allowing demons to roam the Earth. So of course it was only a matter of time until a genre film would exploit the idea of a particle accelerator accidentally causing a rift into other dimensions and parallel realities across the space-time continuum.And let's be fair here for a moment: in the history of stupid ideas for movies - especially genre pictures - this certainly isn't the dumbest concept ever to base a sci-fi/horror film on. Also, by putting a Cloverfield spin on it - which, btw, actually is kind of fitting given it offered the chance to explain how the creature from the first film ""stranded"" on earth - the filmmakers managed to get the film a kind of attention it otherwise certainly wouldn't have had. It was a smart marketing stunt (as was selling the movie to Netflix) and probably crucial to keeping the film cost effective and being able to put as much money as possible into the visual effects (the budget for the whole film was only 25 million, and practically the only P&A costs this film had was the Super Bowl ad).What I also don't get is why people expect ""hard"" science from the kind of pulpy sci-fi/horror movie 'The Cloverfield Paradox' clearly is; there's obviously nobody who knows what would or wouldn't happen if other dimensions and parallel universes existed, let alone how physics would behave if they somehow ""crashed"" into each other. And of course it's all speculation and characters behaving erratically: that's part of what makes those films FUN. And believe it or not, that's exactly what I had. But don't take my word for it, make up your own mind; chances are, if you're into genre picutures (where solid entries with very decent visual effects are few and far between), you'll experience a similar sensation.P.S.

The Cloverfield Paradox,"I swear this was written by a 10 year-old. A few quick examples roughly in order of occurence:1) ""The world is almost out of oil and everyone is going to die if we don't find this theoretical energy."" I guess solar, geothermal, wind, and hydro-electric solutions don't exist in this universe. Plus it's the future, these technologies would almost certainly be much further developed/implemented by then to boot.2) Within 10 minutes some random dude pretty much says, ""If we conduct this experiment we could have monsters rise from the sea in the past!"" Uh...kinda specific there, buddy. Almost like you've seen Cloverfield.3) After the experiment goes awry and all the station's systems shut down, they can't detect Earth...and half if not most of the crew of scientists automatically assume it's because Earth disappeared. Not because, you know, the systems are down.4) After confirming the Earth was gone they didn't think to use the stars to find their location until way, way later. Maybe I just don't know what scientists are.5) When the Russian is thrown on a table and immediately dies, you hear a flatline. He was never connected to any equipment. This is one of the only enjoyable scenes.6) Many drug trip-esque random events that have nothing to do with anything and don't even jive with the ""different realities smashing together"" theory. Example: a guy for some reason gets his arm sucked into a nonsensically morphing wall, the wall takes it off painlessly and spits it out, then the arm comes alive with a mind of its own ala The Addams Family (or Evil Dead 2), writes down ""Check the dead Russian's stomach!"" and in his stomach they find the exact battery they needed to do something.7) Example 2: a tank full of worms loses only all the worms and they suddenly appear inside the Russian, killing him as mentioned from before. This, and many other stupid things, aren't ""random events"" but would take intelligence (or stupidity) and coordination to pull off. Though the woman appearing in the wall was kinda cool.8) Wall Girl, who suddenly appeared from another universe, has to wear another dude's uniform because hers got chopped up in the wall's wiring. Good thing it's fitted perfectly for her size and shape. Future clothes rocks.9) Wall Girl doesn't know Asian Girl because SHE (Wall Girl) is the alternate universe's Shepherd (experiment name) engineer. But later she (Wall Girl) says that Main Girl was never on the ship in her alternate universe because she (Wall Girl) went on the mission in Main Girl's place. Main Girl and Asian Girl have completely different jobs. This one's a thinker but it's a nice fat plot contradiction, even in a movie with alternate universes.10) Favorite line: ""Shepherd smashed a Higgs Boson, overloaded, somehow ended up here."" I bet they just looked up trending science topics on Twitter and injected them randomly in dialogue, because these are just words.11) So why did the metal glue grab the guy and stick him to the wall? And don't say the unexplained magnetism because that was pulling consistently in one direction and to achieve what happened it had to succumb to the magnetism then (after grabbing him) somehow completely resist the intense magnetic field and suck him to the wall like a monster, even though all the other metal did not experience this effect.12) A room filled with water is instantly completely frozen when exposed to space, but a room filled with air exposed to space doesn't see as much as a speck of frost although water's thermal conductivity is way, WAY less than air's. Go science!13) A group has to manually eject a giant spinny thing so the ship doesn't explode. The commander heroically seals himself in with it to eject it easier. A crew mate yells, ""No! We can do this remotely!"" I love it.14) The miscalculated Shepherd experiment makes a bunch of random chaotic things happen including sending their ship to a different universe. How do we get back? Press the button again, make more more random chaotic things happen and of course it'll perfectly transport us back to the spot we came from but change nothing else.15) Main Girl, before transporting back to her original universe/Earth, sends a message with constructional and operational plans for the Shepherd machine (what they're in space experimenting with) to hopefully save that alternate Earth's fuel supply. Though Wall Girl from that alternate universe/Earth is there to begin with because she's on the same mission, in the same space station, with the same device that malfunctioned. I think they forgot.16) And best for last: They never say what ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" is. Do they mean the chance of multiple universes colliding? Because that's not a paradox, it's an effect. This supports my hypothesis that they just picked fun science words to scatter about.",positive
Life,"This has to be the worst sci-fi movie I have ever seen (and trust me I have seen a lot). It is an insult to anyone with just half a brain. But let me give you a little taste of this gem:It starts off with a capsule with a soil probe from Mars on its way to Earth that is out of control due to a crash with little meteorites. The ISS, where the probe should be processed, has to catch it manually, which they do by means of an extendable arm. Okay. I wont go into the physics off this, but if you have ever seen how much energy is set free when a car crashes into something with 100km/h relative velocity, you should know that such a catching maneuver is bound to go south (not even talking about the problem of maintaining a space station in geostationary orbit with nothing but little jet nozzles whilst trying to get it into a configuration such that it has low relative velocity with respect to a capsule that is headed straight for Earth with something like 20000km/h). Mind you, at this point we are 5 minutes into the movie and the science was already thrown out of the window.Fast forward. We are in the CDC approved lab, which is a plexiglass shielded section of the ISS with nothing but a plexiglass door without any further safety precautions. Inside this section is a glove box, where they keep the probe. Turns out the probe contains life which has been idle for about 4 billion years without decaying (obviously entropy doesn't apply to aliens). Well, how about we try to wake it without further investigation? Yeah, let's do that.Fast forward. It has grown to a hand-sized organism, but has fallen into a slumber again. It's still inside the glove box and attacks the biologist who tried to wake it by electrocuting it. It breaks his tool and his hand, which causes him to faint, and leads to its escape from the box by means of using the broken tool to cut open the glove of the glove box. (yeah, it only took earth's organisms like 3 billion years to learn to use tools, this thing does it in less than 12 hours). But fear not, whilst the life form is busy eating a rat, a colleague hops in the lab and pulls the biologist out. Surprise, surprise, the organism latches on him, so that the other guys have to seal him into the lab. He tries to burn the organism with an oxygen torch and with a flame thrower (which they obviously have ready to use on a space station, ofc). Welp, it doesn't help, this carbon-water-based organism is immune to fire (hey, because chemistry doesn't apply to aliens, didn't you know?). Subsequently, the organism kills him and eats him from the inside. The fire has caused the air vents to open, which somehow can only be closed one by one, and gives the organism time to flee.Jup, we are not even 20 minutes into this masterpiece but the stupidity is mind-boggling. I could keep on writing about a lot more of this utterly dumb movie (like the organism being able to survive in space for prolonged times, the space station being out of fuel just at a time where it is convenient for the ""plot"", the organism drinking toxic liquid coolant, the space station going on a descent right after it has been pushed outward on an ascending course (because screw logic), etc.), but let me finish by saying that in the end of the movie this organism has figured out how to read instruments in an escape pod, how to steer said escape pod and how to safely reenter it into earth's atmosphere, all whilst fighting the astronaut in the escape pod. (Which was tried to be masked as plot twist. but you could see that one from a mile away). And although it has killed every astronaut basically on sight, it decided to leave this last one in the escape pod alive with itself latched to him. Wanna know why? Because it has anticipated that, despite it successfully completing the landing of a space ship, it won't be able to open the door of the escape pod and someone on the outside has to do it for it. Which some fisher men actually do, despite the fact that they can clearly see that inside the pod there is a bloody, heavily injured astronaut with a man-sized alien octopus attached to it.I urge you to not go to watch this movie. Waste of time and money. I have suffered through it. No need for you to suffer too.",negative

If you want to watch a sci-fi alien monster movie that's 'realistic', go watch some NASA documentaries, don't come to the cinemas.Another reason for all the bad reviews seems to be that it 'tries to imitate Alien but fails'. Well, f**k, then no one else should ever try to make another space monster movie ever! Lets just keep watching the 1979 'Alien' again and again........seriously.....So, why do i think this movie is so much better than all the negative press it is getting ? Well for a change it's set on the ISS, not a fictional planet or space-ship floating around 100s of light-years away.....(implausible they say). It has people who seem to be astronauts, dealing with a growing life form, rather than space heroes shooting space guns at space monsters (unrealistic, they say). The horror, suspense and intrigue (which critics say stems for unrealistic situations) is in my opinion a near-perfect example of Murphy's law in action. Then, the acting (another prickly point for the critics) is actually very well done given the situations the characters find themselves in. Reynolds, Gylenhaal & Ferguson all deliver solid performances in an era where all the 'acting' talent is reserved for sentimental Oscar-bait movies. As for the plot? strong, fast-paced yet coherent enough for us uninitiated every-day astronauts. And a SOLID twist at the very end.So, all-in-all, ignore the hate and give this movie a try \m/",positive
Downsizing,"This movie is a complete waste of time. I feel like unfortunately Matt Damon is now just trying to make money no matter how awful the script is. His last two movies (Suburbicon and now this, Downsizing) have been awful.I watched this movie for free and I still want my money back. It was extremely long, boring, no storyline, no plot. After the first 30 minutes, everything seems 'normal sized' like in any other movie because you are just in the downsized world so everything seems 'normal'. There is no contrast between the real world and the downsized world because they completely stopped showing the real world.I don't know what the point of this movie was. The premise was clever but the execution just wasn't there. Seems like they got a good idea and forgot to write a story.Some things to think about:
If in the real world, your $1 can be $10,000 times, then why are there still 'projects' and extreme poverty stricken people in the downsized world? How did they get $15,000 regular money to get the procedure done only to become downsized and remain in their awful conditions? And if they had even $100 saved up, that would be equivalent to 1 million dollars so why exactly are they so poor?",negative
Downsizing,"So many people giving this movie a bad review, don't listen to them! This movie is phenomenal. I was expecting what all the people giving bad reviews were expecting, a silly, comedic, over-the-top movie with SNL alum. What I got instead was far better. The movie is still very funny; just with a more intelligent sense of humor. The central message of the movie is not actually an environmental tree-hugger propaganda film, like many have suggested, but instead is a message about growing where you are planted; and about realizing that while some seek to do things that might change and save the world, without being willing to help those around you; what is the point of anything else? This movie is funny, heartwarming and impactful. Those that are hating on it are hating on it because they lack the ability to see the depth of this truly amazing movie. It has made its way into my top 5 movies; I hope it does the same for you.",positive
Elysium,"This movie was such a colossal failure on so many levels. I don't usually write reviews for movies, but this monstrosity was so atrocious that I felt compelled to warn unsuspecting potential viewers of the steaming pile of sewage that is referred to as ""Elysium"".Where to startFirst off, the plot was a laughingstock. Even if you can ignore the choppy camera-work that looks like the doings of a toddler with a buffed up camera, there's no ignoring the plot. Some examples of the numerous holes in the plot 1) Apparently, if a grenade gets blown up inches from your head, your brain is still intact and it can be repaired at Elysium. 2) If Carlyle could make the code to make Jodie Foster president, then why didn't he just make himself president or give himself all the power, by implementing the code himself or subtly adding a nuance in there? Not the sharpest tool in the shed. 3) Where are all the satellites to help track down Matt Damon while he is fleeing the villains? It seems some of the technology 100+ years in the future has actually regressed. 4) If the medical terminals can literally give a person a new head, through repairing a ""brain"", why can't they disable the sociopathic tendencies of characters like Jodie Foster on Elysium? Once again, only certain technology has evolved for the director's benefit. 5) In order to let one spaceship enter Elysium, you must allow all spaceships to enter too by taking down the no-fly zone. That makes total sense. 6) Last but certainly not least: the ending. Apparently everyone is going to live happily ever after on Elysium now? Every rich person on Elysium just wanted all those poor people on earth to suffer! But now the world is sugar plums and everyone lives happily! Yay!Secondly, there was never any point in the film in which I felt connected to the characters in any matter. Why was this? Well, none of them had any depth. The dialogue was one cliché after another. The primary villain in the story appears to have some sort of speech impediment, because for most of the movie he is inaudible. A well-told story will also have a villain that has deeper complexities as to his/her background and motives. This character was just a bumbling moron. Matt Damon and Jodie Foster did the best that they could, but their scripts were so poor that it would have been more interesting had they been reading off the menu at a local Olive Garden. The exchange regarding the hippo between Damon and the little girl that is dying of seizures had me cringing in my seat at the awkwardness of the whole matter. I should have walked out then and there.Also, why was the best look we ever got of Elysium one where we saw a few trees and a woman swimming in a pool? Would looking at the inner workings of the politics and lifestyle on Elysium simply have exposed this film for the fraud that it is? I'm not going to go too deeply into the themes of the movie, as everyone has their own opinions, but it doesn't take much to realize the hidden (and rather misguided, imo) opinion of the director in this one. The message was about as subtle as receiving a ton of bricks to the head. View at your own risk for your blood pressure will likely rise after watching this one, as it objectively is a pathetic disgrace of a film.",negative
Elysium,"Can't tell you how great it is to see someone capable of filling Ridley Scott's and James Cameron's shoes! Blomkamp has made the best movie yet this year. I was intrigued by District 9. It made me think, but this self-assured and skillfully crafted effort is taking his game to a much higher level.It's been a long time since I was in awe of both the script and the direction. To see they both came from one guy, Neill Blomkamp, is wonderful if a little unnerving. Do we really have to rely on foreigners for biting social commentary?This film is much more clever than most reviewers are letting on. One reviewer said it's a bit melodramatic, but, frankly, I don't see a subtle treatment getting to first base with most Americans. This puts a lot of troubling issues in sharp relief in an artful, very watchable format whereas most of the arguments about immigration, healthcare and the rich versus the poor are in dense, boring prose.I was warned that Jodie Foster's performance was marred by odd accents, but I barely noticed. I thought she depicted a kind of sharp edged conservative that should be readily recognizable. Sharlto Copley is great as a vicious soldier and Matt Damon is the likable center of the film, as called for. The supporting actors including Braga, Luna and Fichtner, to name a few, all add much to the whole enterprise.This is definitely a go see and I wouldn't hesitate recommending it to anyone, including pre-teens and up.",positive
The Endless,"I feel it is not really appropriate for people to review films where they essentially got bored and their attention wandered off. sometimes some people are just not wired to like some films.
the problem here is while I did in fact lose interest in this film, I continued to force myself to stay on to it.
First off, it takes a full 1 hour and 20 minutes for the film to get into its ""real"" plot with sci-fi/horror elements. Up until then, we are stuck with two protagonists, formerly a part of a UFO Death Cult, who inexplicably get sent a goodbye video from the cult indicating the cult is still alive. So they go back to the cult and just start squatting and paling around with their old cult friends, all while dryly navel gazing and having some of the most broad, non-specific, generalized conversations possible to convey drama without actually giving us any real substance behind it.
At no point throughout the first hour and 20 minutes do I ever figure out who these people are, what they are, why they have come back, or anything at all about this supposed cult. At no point does any of the meandering dialogue ever approach anything resembling the plot at this point. The only thing we get is that one of the two friends feels at home back in his cult, and the other one doesn't. The only thing overly unusual is the appearance of two moons in the sky, which one of them coyly responds is an atmospheric effect of some sort. It takes a full hour and 20 minutes to get that far and literally no further.
After a full hour and 20 minutes of NOTHING, the movie starts throwing baffling sequences that make no sense, random discoveries of tapes and computer harddrives, implications of a time paradox or the like, and constant mentioning of a ""loop"" which, as minutes tick past and the film rolls on, reeks copiously of Telling, and not Showing.
what basically destroys this movie is it pushes its sci-fi/horror/mystery all the way literally to the very last 30 minutes, and spends the first ONE HOUR AND TWENTY MINUTES not only never even coming close to its ""Loop"" storyline, but settling on a character story between two characters who have no personalities and literally no meaningful interactions with anyone in the entire film. Everyone acts like they never really left the cult because they are such wafer-thin non-entities that they may as well have not been in the film at all. they could easily be replaced by any random duo, even Laurel and Hardy, and have absolutely nothing meaningful change in any way.
By the time genuinely interesting head-spinning stuff starts happening, it's too late. The film has already wasted all its time and instead just taunts us with some genuinely intriguing and compelling imagery, like the fractured remnants of a far superior film that ran out of money 30 minutes in and had to be filled in with cheap, hastily written nothingness.",negative
The Endless,"Sci-fi isn't just Stars Wars/Trek+Marvel with big stars in flash outfits , jetting around the universe in huge space ships battling intergalactic bad guys with big, set piece special effects every 15 mins to hold an audiences attention.

Transformers: Age of Extinction,"Ahhh where to start. I usually don't write reviews. But yesterday's disappointment in watching this had to be expressed either through punching an anvil, or writing this review. But i need my hands this week so I'm going to write a review.I am a fan of transformers, i loved the cartoon series and the first and second blockbuster hit. I saw quite a substantial amount of plot holes in the third installation and I knew it was going to go downhill from there. I had hopes that the age of extinction would clear some of the plot holes i saw from the dark of the moon, and after seeing the movie trailers I became somewhat excited and felt all warm inside.I brought my two boys with me, bought some overpriced pop-corns and sugar drinks to stimulate my mind so that my brain could focus and absorb the new concept of the story, hoping to satisfy my hunger for unanswered questions that left my joy decimated at the last series.I like Walhberg during action scenes, but not when he starts making lame dialogues. And those lame dialogues deviate from being a bit funny, to just stab me in my thighs, depending on who wrote the script. Lame dialogues pervaded the whole friggen movie! There are countless, pointless, perpetually boring ass things that prevented the story, or just the movie as a whole from being appreciated. The characters were annoying, namely Lucas, Tessa and that friggen Shane who is nothing but a disrespectful little sh*t to Walhberg and exhibited this attitude throughout until third quarter of the movie. I'm a dad alright, and I just wanted to punch him the f**k out! And Walhberg should've done the same, what the hell? Few good actors, but the characters were weak. Every time i thought that the movie was trying to make people laugh, I look around the entire cinema and see people staring at the screen, not laughing. I look at my boys and they're not laughing, and they're the type that laugh at anything that moves. I'm not laughing because my mind is struggling trying to keep that hope alive while at the same time enduring the thought of another ominous outcome, ""when is this going to end?"", ""stop doing stupid things"", ""stop trying to make me laugh"", ""just stop talking"", ""OMG what am I doing here?""I finish the giant popcorn and my big tub of sugar drink after an hour. I thought that if i just go out for a smoke, maybe i'll be able to appreciate the rest of the movie because my mind will be refreshed. I'll take my time, maybe say hi to that nice ticket collector and make small talk. That's 10 minutes to recuperate. It couldn't be that bad.I get back to my seat. Nothing changes... Every new main event that was introduced in the movie was not properly explained in the end. In other words, it just came out of nowhere and went nowhere. This just piled up leaving me with more and more questions. It seems as if plots were inserted in holes and the viewer was left to create his own resolution of it. The story is incongruently incoherent. Why after all this time, can't Bumblebee talk? With all the autonomous robotic, high alien-technologically advanced race systems that are available that they can't rectify his voice box?? I wanted to see more of the dinobots. And why were they in the... never mind, no spoilers.Yes most of the action scenes were great, but come on, don't make it lame by adding something that doesn't belong there, like another horrific comment, phrase or something that isn't funny. It destroys the entertainment. In fact, just don't even talk during the action scenes please!Graphics are awesome. That's the only thing I appreciate. So unfortunately i left disappointed once again. More than disappointed, irritated and frustrated. I asked my boys what they thought, they said ""ummm... awesome?"" as if that definition has lost it's meaning and they weren't entirely sure how to make me feel better. I wanted to research on the writers and directors who created this movie to try and figure out how they defiled a great science fiction theme, but I couldn't give a cross-bun anymore. I'll let it roll this time. I feeling a bit better now.In the end i figure this movie suits those who don't care too much about story lines and great characters and dialogues. Mainly those who like to see giant robots fight. but the movie is rated for matured audiences and robot fights only took place during half the movie. So then I question what are the creators of this film trying to achieve? Use the name for profit and create something primarily for entertainment purposes. But today's audience are rational thinkers who want more than just action scenes and loud explosions. So...",negative
Transformers: Age of Extinction,"This movie has to be the last nail in the coffin for Micheal Bay's Transformers franchise , the over use of lens flare is super annoying in 3d and gets old very fast , the random explosions that go off time and time again get old very fast , the use of particle effects is very cool in this movie and certain points it works very well but ... there is times in the movie where the particles kinda take over the screen and just distract you from the movie.The amount of random chase scenes is insane and in my opinion their not done well at all , the tracking on them is done so bad that you get the feeling that the characters can teleport from one place to another.Im not one to right reviews to movies but in the case the movie made me so angry I had to .",positive
Hotel Artemis,"The premise to this film sounded like a lot of fun.. take the criminal hotel from John Wick and set it in the near future with a quirky Jodie Foster in charge.Unfortunately what follows is a mess of a film that tries it's hardest to be a Quentin Tarantino-esque character piece but completely devoid of the interesting characters or snappy dialogue that makes the QT films work so well.It's a shame really as the cast is really good but they never rise about the mundane script which just drags. Sequences happen for little or no reason, character interactions seems oddly improvised and boring instead of fun. There's also a number of plot holes and character inconsistencies which just make everything seem like a total mess.I was literally counting the ceiling titles when Jeff Goldblum showed up.. I was hoping he would bring some of his magic to the film but unfortunately his contribution is more or less a brief cameo.Ultimately I found this film to commit the worst of all movie sins -- it's boring. There's really nothing here that's compelling as it fails on almost every front. The premise (while a bit derivative) had a lot of potential but you need a good foundation to make it work. Unfortunately the script here is so bad it makes the film almost unwatchable.I rarely give movies such a low rating but had I not been with a group I probably would have walked out. I should never be this bored at a cinema.",negative
Hotel Artemis,"From the soundtrack, to every moment of each actor on-screen, LOVED it. Seriously, there was not one actor that was off. I fell in love with Dave Bautista's character (and it was great to see him out of GOTG makeup). I knew he was pretty good in other things, but this role just fit him so well. Jodie Foster was fantastic. So much so, in fact, that I wondered whether she actually moves like she did in the film, in real life. Sofia Boutella is just gorgeous, and I really liked that her action scenes were fantastically choreographed, without being over the top (say, as the scenes with Theron in Atomic Blonde which were just a little much). Sterling K. Brown brought a depth of character I had not seen before from him, and Jeff Goldblum ... well, is there really any role he's played where he's not a favorite? As for the premise? Why NOT? In most 'futuristic' movies one must stretch to suspend belief in order to be carried into it. This one was really not that far off, so it was easy to believe from the get-go.I think, based just upon one watch, that it has gained a place among my top ten movies of all time, and the fact that it only scored a 6.2 on IMDB BAFFLES me.",positive
The World's End,"The Cornetto series continues with nothing short of what you'd expect from Wright, Pegg and Frost. Delivering top laughs with great action and a little bit of romance to suit all audiences. The film's visual style is quite appealing. The only downside to this film some may see is that the gore is not traditional (being robots). The style of violence in Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz shine through with just a bit of a blue tint. The characters are just plain lovable and hilarious in their own ways. Most of the laughs in this film came straight from dialogue of characters rather than visuals. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed this film, a fun comedy with nothing to pick on whatsoever A top film just like the others!",negative
The World's End,"The Smashing Pumpkins may have mused that 'The End is the Beginning is the End,' but Edgar Wright knew better. He knew that for his beloved 'Cornetto Trilogy,' he would need an ending that could somehow tie up all of its strains of manic, voracious genre pastiche, savage wit and silliness, and, most importantly, its symphony to the reluctant aging of the schlubby, post- Shaun adult male. He knew he needed to do something special.So, in the words of Shaun, ""what do you mean, DO something?"" Well, getting the old gang together for a nostalgia-fuelled 'one last job' pub crawl, charged with more emotional weight and subtext than meets the eye should about do it. In this regard, Cornetto #3 is by far the most personal, mature, reflective, bittersweet and cognizant film in Wright's oeuvre. It knowingly winks at his past works (don't forget to say hi to Brian, Marsha, and Tires, listen for the fruit machine, and enjoy an appropriately sly Cornetto cameo), while introducing some of his most hysterically snappy wordplay yet (""maybe it's a windoor...!""). And, as no Wright film could ever be that straightforward, it's also, naturally, about the end of the world. Duh.To some, The World's End will be a cracking sci-fi pastiche - Invasion of the Body Snatchers handled with the chilly British terseness of The Day of the Triffids. To others, it's a riotous, boozy action-comedy with a kickass set of tunes, and prime viewing before hitting the pub (or several) with your mates. All of these things are true. But for me, it will always be a film about growing up. A film about finding closure, and purpose. A film about coming home and moving on at once. A film encouraging the Gary King in all of us to make peace with friends, the past, the future, and ourselves. It's the perfect filmic encapsulation of playing James Bond video games in my adolescent basement. And it's a film about pursuing your dreams, even - nay, especially - if your dreams are pointless, idiotic, and involve a sh*t-ton of drinking.Things get going at an almost ponderously slow and repetitive pace, forcing the viewer to be bludgeoned by Gary King, alongside his estranged high school buddies, into going on his quest with him. The tone is fun, but with a bit of an edge, Pegg bravely playing obnoxious at full tilt, keeping it unclear as to whether you can or should like him. But, upon arriving in the impossibly quaint Newton Haven (and here Wright coins the most on-the-nose term for cultural assimilation and the dearth of family-run local business: ""Starbucking"". Remember that theme; it'll come in handy later), things pick up, and then some. Here, King's raucous enthusiasm becomes almost worrisome, especially in contrast with his bemused buddies, all more content to act their ages. Thankfully, the sci-fi framework comes to the rescue right when King is on the cusp of having to be serious. The solution, like fellow extraterrestrial alcoholicomedy Grabbers? Keep drinking - to ""blend in"", of course. And, as the Doors kick in, that's where the fun really begins.Wright's characteristic swish-pans and dynamic sound effects, paired with some of the most intricately crunchy fight choreography seen in ages make The World's End thrilling in the most visceral sense. There's no purer cinematic joy than a long-take tracking shot of Pegg weaving in and out of a chaotic robot throwdown, stepping on bar stools and counter tops, sipping his pint and throwing the occasional like a tipsy Buster Keaton, and it's impossible not to share in Wright's glee. The robot designs are eerily simple, the pace and physical slapstick are howlingly perfect, while the grim, sepia lighting is perfectly atmospheric for the intensifying sci-fi peril and slurring melodrama unfolding. And the climactic, belligerent belch of a speech demanding agency on behalf of the human race? I dare you to find more galvanizing words.Gary King is a courageously different Simon Pegg than has been unleashed before, and his manic energy, boundless but strained charisma and desperate arrogance make for his most achingly human (but still hilarious) creation yet. Nick Frost also digs into unforeseen dramatic meat, pairing his juggernaut physical comedy with real pain and hard-won regret, all the funnier for being so truthful. There's also a gag involving him (literally) punching a clock which may be the funniest in Wright's oeuvre. Paddy Considine and Martin Freeman collectively ace the two sides of the middle-aged-hipster coin (post-meathead athletic emotional sensitivity and antiquated, bluetoothed tech-speak respectively), while Eddie Marsan finds both huge laughs and the most raw hangdog pathos in the sweetness of Peter Page. Sadly, in the film's only real fault, Edgar's boys club has no proper room for Rosamund Pike, and it's a real shame, as she's on typically superb form, and amiably hilarious to boot. As this instalment's former-007-turned- villain-with-uncomfortable-facial-hair, Pierce Brosnan tweaks his debonair charm and silky Irish accent to their most calmly sinister, while the inevitable Bill Nighy is deliciously bemused as a big lamp who just won't f*ck off back to Legoland.The World's End (or, as everyone should henceforth refer to it, 'Smashy-Smashy-Egg-Men'), is not only a stupendously satisfying Cornetto resolution. It's perfectly paced, technically flawless, thrilling, hugely fun, and bravely emotional romp. It's arguably the funniest and most real mediation on friends, homecomings, and befuddled male aging to date. It's a belligerently, obstinately, chaotically, damn good film. It's something truly special. So hop into the Beast, blare those Soup Dragons, and ride Wright's beautiful disaster all the way to the bitter end. Or lager end. Because, be honest: what could be a more heartfelt answer to Primal Scream's recurring query - ""Just what is it that you want to do?""-10/10",positive
Ghostbusters: Answer the Call,The women are bright and sparkly and smart and oh so tolerant of the stupid ditzy husband/man/boyfriend.What a cliche.Shame on all concerned (especially the so-called man in this film).,negative
Ghostbusters: Answer the Call,"When I heard that they were remaking the movie Ghostbusters with female cast members, I admit that I was actually looking forward to it, specially considering the four particular actresses they had chosen for the part. I understood that movie remakes are typically the greatest, but considering the fact that 3 out of the four cast members are currently or were once members of SNL, I had some hope. Unfortunately, Wigg's comedic talent wasn't able to shine with her boring character with a lack of personality, McKinnon's character was just upright stupid and unrealistic, Jones's character was just a black stereotype, and McCarthy's role lacked character as well. Many of the jokes just fell flat (Steve Higgins small role and joke with the middle finger, the won tons, Kevin's (aka. Chris Hemsworth's) logo scene, the thing with the hair dye at the end, and so on). Also, the had many references to the original ghost busters throughout the film, and yet I suppose the setting takes place in a universe where the original squad had never existed, it's like a slap to the face to the original cast. Sure they had Bill Murry and few other actors for the older version show up in a few small parts, but they play such tiny roles, and as different characters..And what's the deal with remaking older movies with female actresses or poc as the main characters. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with Hollywood wanting a bit of diversity in their work, but they're doing it all wrong. While this movie has good intentions when trying to cast female members, I guess either to have more representation for younger girls to look up to or show that women are equal to men or whatever, but when they try to do with a remake of a movie that was already amazing, it only makes matters worse. This movie will be forgotten within a few years from now, unlike the 1988 version, which most people had at least heard of reguardless of age before this one. On second thought, this movie isn't trying to create diversity, they're doing this for profit. They know that with the adults and their nostalgia these days, and with the younger now being obsessed with the classics due to them being conditioned to think that everything from their own generation sucks (which is clearly saying a lot about the older generation ironically, they're the ones whom produce our movies, not us), they can get some quick and lazy bucks by bringing back a film that should've been left alone in the first place instead of thinking up of a new script and story (that of which could also have female and/or poc leading characters), because they know people are more drawn to things that they are familiar with (as was I obviously). Whatever, I'm so done with remakes. There are many movies out there in today's time (yeah they exist) with original plot lines that are currently or were recently successful in the last year or so, so why watch a crappier version of a movie you've already seen before?",positive
Godzilla,"So, I should start by saying, I went to this move not expecting a lot. My husband wanted to see it, however, so off we go.. Dear Lord, I think I'm going to find the sappiest chic flick available (even if its torturous for me to sit through) just to get payback for him making me sit through 2 hours of this crap. At least the popcorn was good!!I liked Godzilla himself.. But, I think out of the entire 123 minutes, you see him only 20 minutes, maybe? And most of that is just watching his spiky back in the water as he swims. The rest of this movie is watching the main actor, who, in my opinion, has about as much acting depth as Kristen Stewart, look like a total tool. The shining grace, I thought, was that this movie had Ken Watanabe in it. I like Watanabe but even he looked like he was suffering from a bad case of the Taco Bell revenge and couldn't find a bathroom for the entire movie.I spent the majority of this movie picking out dumb stuff that just amounts to bad writing. Example: Okay, the two bad monsters (which, in my opinion resemble a cross between those white strider things that the muppets ride in ""The Dark Crystal"" with a bit of ""Aliens"" thrown in to make them somewhat scary?) have the ability of creating EMPs, killing all electronics and causing aircraft to fall out of the sky.. We learn this early on in the movie, probably in the first 30 minutes. Think the military learns their lesson?? Nope, lets continuously throw about 600 billion dollars worth of F-35s and Battleships in the mix just so we can have it continuously plummet into the water. Another example: They know these muppet hybrids like to eat Radioactive materials and I guess can smell it. And hey, there's one making its way from Vegas to San Fransisco. So lets strap a huge bomb on a train and slowly move it from Vegas to San Fransisco along the same exact path that the critter is going. What kinda harm could that cause? Its not like the thing would smell it on the train and come after it, right? And why is it, the military storms into a radioactive storage facility but has no clue that an entire half of mountain has just been blasted out by muppet hybrid #2 (who's much bigger than #1) and this 30 story tall critter is somehow making its way towards Vegas completely undetected? And while we're on the subject of the bomb, what the heck is up with the ""breeding"" of the two muppet hybrids anyway?? You got a male, you got a female (complete with some glowy bulging egg sac thing that they give us a really good closeup of.. They meet up to reproduce.. which involves the male giving the female the long, phallic shaped, radioactive bomb which she then rubs between her legs all over this glowy egg sac.. WtF?? How the heck did these things breed before mankind started making huge phallic shaped missiles anyway? Oh..Did I mention the acting was bad?? I don't recall liking ANY of the characters, with exception to the dad (played by Bryan Cranston) and he dies within the first 20 minutes of the movie. There are characters that seem to have no purpose whatsoever besides trying to find a way to fill a 2 hour movie with irrelevant fluff. Lil Asian boy on the elevated train in Hawaii? Didn't see any point to him.. The main characters wife and little boy?? Added nothing to the story to be honest. (And what military wife who knows her husband is in danger isn't waiting by the phone for news? Nope, phones ringing and she's doing whatever.. Or tells her co-worker she's unavailable?) The acting had no depth to it, everyone came off very flat and honestly, unlikable. There's no emotion whatsoever. Hey, a couple of muppet hybrids are destroying our city, oh well. A huge Godzilla is barreling towards our aircraft carrier? Don't panic.. lets stand at the guardrail and watch it peacefully because any emotion such as fear would be too much to ask.Pretty sad when the most exciting thing about this movie is a bird hitting the bus window.. Although, to be honest, the CGI on the actual fight between Godzilla and the muppet hybrids was nice, the whole 5 minutes it lasted. Then, Godzilla jumps in the water and the credits roll. Best part of the whole movie.. Compared to the other 121 minutes of this movie, the credits are the best 2 minutes overall.",negative
Godzilla,"Remember 'Jaws'? Remember the way you only got to see little glimpses of the shark or just the remains of his victims for nearly half the movie? Instead, you got to meet half the town first and all the main characters while fear and paranoia slowly spread across the whole community, and when the great white guy finally did make his entrance - boy, what an impact he had. Now, that was 40 years ago - but would it be possible to make that kind of movie today? To show restraint despite a budget of 160+ million dollars and all the latest state of the art CGI-effects the blockbuster factory has to offer?As it turns out, it's not quite possible; at least not as far as this latest version of 'Godzilla' is concerned - but that's probably not for lack of trying on director Gareth Edwards' part. The young director ('Monsters') has stated many times that 'Jaws' was a huge inspiration for him on this movie, and it is hardly a coincidence that the (human) hero in 'Godzilla' shares the same name with the hero in Spielberg's masterpiece (they're both called Brody).Edwards made it very clear that he wanted to take an ""old school"" approach - and as far as the beautiful, haunting build-up of the first half of the movie is concerned, he actually succeeds. The atmosphere of mystery and dread is tangible; the human element is there, the acting and the dialogues are solid, and the production design is breathtaking (especially the apocalyptic images of an evacuated city in Japan which was left to decay for 15 years, overgrown with plants and with packs of wild dogs running in the streets). The ""muto"" design - when we do get a first glimpse at a creature - is otherworldly and frightening (as good monsters should be), but as the movie progresses into the second half and the creature-action increases, the quality of the pacing, the dialogues and the acting inexplicably decreases. The movie sadly starts to feel flat, and although there is one great creature scene after another, and although those scenes get more and more intense as the storyline steers towards the inevitable showdown, it's hard to stay invested in the human side of the story.After the first act (when there was actually still some real acting required from the actors), there are virtually no interesting moments anymore when the human protagonists interact, let alone lingering scenes where the characters get to talk long enough to one another to even try to build such a thing as chemistry. So when the finale does arrive (which looks absolutely beautiful, by the way), you admire its epic scale, but since there is nobody to care about, it's hard to feel thrilled.Sure, you kind of root for Godzilla, but since you only just met the guy, you don't feel too much attached. Ultimately - despite a great build-up and a fantastic looking finale - 'Godzilla' is a valid effort but only rarely a thrilling one. Unlike in 'Jaws', there are no interesting human characters here who could help create the kind of tension-heavy atmosphere or sense of impending doom the way Chief Brody, Hooper and Quint could 40 years ago.Trying to show restraint alone is not enough to create a sense of wonder the way seventies cinema did - you also need the kind of character-driven scenes where someone says: ""We're gonna need a bigger boat!""Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",positive
Freaks,"Been waiting awhile to watch this take on ""what if mutants (X-men) started popping up in the real world?"" Suspenceful script, taut direction and an excellent cast elevate this fine indie flick. Bruce Dern and Emile Hirsch star in this sci-fi thriller and with those two you know the movie is off to a good start. The claustrophobic atmosphere and smart script literally kept me on the edge of my seat for much of the picture. Really enjoyed it, well done.",negative

Minions,"Words fail both me and my girlfriend in describing this awful piece of digested food. This movie is bad even by kid standards and, frankly, I don't think they could've managed to ruin the Minions any better. Half the dialog in this movie is in Minionese, of which nothing can be understood. The jokes are so bad, all they managed was get a single l.o.l. out of us. Nope, not a laugh, a l.o.l. The ""villainesse"" is boring, overdone and, frankly, unforgettable for how bad she is. Even the Minions are boring (how they accomplished that is beyond me). To say nothing of the way they portrayed the Queen of England and England itself. I'm Romanian and it still made me angry! If you want to watch this, just don't. Spare yourself the time, boredom and probably money and SEE SOMETHING ELSE.",negative
Minions,"I avoided watching Despicable Me for a long time. I just didn't like the look of it. But as it turned out, I loved the film when I was eventually coerced into seeing it by one of my nephews. It was thanks to him that I also liked the second movie. As for the third movie, I don't know why some IMDb users are complaining that this movie is more suitable for 'kids and families'. It seems odd to expect anything more from The Minions when that is the main target audience! I watched this film with my own family and since this was the first time I took my toddler to the cinema, it makes it extra special. I enjoyed the movie, laughed out at several points and liked it even more to see how much my daughter loved it. We all had a good time and there were no complaints at all. This one, like Despicable Me 1 and 2, was great entertainment, lots of villainy and slapstick humour. It is the best kids animation I've seen in a long time. A lot of fun.",positive
Replicas,"If you erase one kid from the other members of the family's minds , wont the other people outside the house that knew that kid start asking questions (what happened to him?)? jesus , you got to have such a low IQ to come up with this , didnt even finish the movie , half way through",negative
Replicas,"The major issue with the film was the writing - the screenplay written by novice Chad St. John (this being his 2nd only screenplay), and the story by a novice Stephen Hamel (this being only his 3rd full length film).The camera directing was fairly decent from Jeffrey Nachmanoff (this being only his 4th full length feature film, his experience mainly in TV series), but I feel he failed in directing his talent properly, especially Alice Eve, who was unconvincing and seemed like this was her first acting role.The S/VFX weren't the greatest, but for a B-grade film low budget film, they were quite adequate - not sure what some of the haters are whining about.It seems that the production itself was a little cheap (thus B-grade), perhaps meant to be a low budget (indie?) film. After all, it was purchased by Entertainment Studios for only 4m.As a huge fan of Keanu Reeves, I feel he should have just stayed on as 1 of the *gulp* 27 producers, and cast someone more fitting as a scientist. I think many decisions couldn't have been easily agreed upon with that many producers.The casting was terrible overall. Security guys with pony tails and sunglasses? The acting again wasn't as good as I expected, but I think that was the directors fault as I mentioned above. The only convincing lead was Thomas Middleditch.As a low budget B-grade film, and although there is a lot of haters out there, it was still decent enough and it kept me pinned to the screen. Had the writing been tighter, directing better, and cast a little differently, then this would have been a hit.Nevertheless, it was still entertaining and I enjoyed it. Not worth the hater's low scores, nor the fake 10's, but it's an honest 8/10 from me - taking into consideration it was a low budget B-grade film.",positive
iBoy,"Let me say from the start, this movie gets a lot of things right but screws up equally as many...First off, thankfully the movie never tries to explain his abilities in detail or justify it any further than the head wound, thus avoiding senseless pseudoscience talks. The acting is above average, the chemistry works, the cinematography is solid and while the plot of ""cleaning up the hood"" doesn't win a price for originality, they even pulled that one off pretty nicely with the rape revenge as the main motivation. The movie also does a pretty good job at showing the trauma caused to Maisie Williams character and doesn't just use her as a plot device. Overall much more than I was expecting from such a rather low budget production which was probably just pitched as ""you need more content on your page ? let me write something up real quick and see where that goes""That being said... They must have just given up writing the script after it was 2/3 done, cause the ending is horrible in every way.Its lazy, it doesn't follow the previously established rules, makes no sense what so ever and doesn't even look cool... After the ""final boss"" is ""defeated"" it gets even worse with an uninspired resolve and no follow-through what so ever.If it had ended after about 60 minutes this could have gotten a much higher rating.",negative
iBoy,"The biggest mistake you can make going into iBoy is expecting something from the Marvel catalog.Cause that is simply not going to happen.Instead what you get is a solid Brit ""estate gang"" story (like Harry Brown 2009 or a dozen others you could probably recite from memory) with some Marvel/Spiderman superhero stuff cleverly thrown in.And that is a mouthful because I have watched and reviewed a lot of films (check out my list, about 1300) and have never seen anything quite like this before.Does it work? For the most part, YES. There are some pacing issues here and there, and it takes a while for the young lead to develop a character arc that the audience is comfortable with, but the suspense/payoff is rock-solid and nail-biting; and the close is edgy but respectful and optimistic.The two best performances come from supporting actors -- another oddity.Maisie Williams steals every scene not otherwise nailed down and does so with a sweetness of character that makes you wish you knew someone like her when you were in school.And Rory Kinnear as the arch-villain almost but not quite moves into the rarefied air of a Bond film -- you keep waiting for him to say ""WHAT DO I WANT IBOY, I WANT YOU TO DIE"" -- but shows enough restraint to keep from falling over the edge.In short, given the brilliant idea, the solid execution and its ability to keep the viewer both offguard and entertained at the same time, this a fun flick deserving of a higher IMDb score than I am seeing.Recommended!",positive
Okja,"OkjaI differentiate between storyteller/filmmakers and the story itself. It isn't such a clean break as this of course; the narrative contract inveigles. But the distinction is useful here. He has a scope he is interested in which could be described as navigating the pull against a world that presents as capricious evil. In earlier films, he moves between giving us the world and giving us the struggler in a way that confuses and challenges earning the distinction as art.This time he again shows his mastery over the ability to balance environment and character. Julio Medem can do this. Kar-Wai Wong. But he picks sides from the first moments and never deviates. The engineered ambiguity is lost. It becomes a master cinematic storyteller delivering a story with impact but no value. We are always on the side of the human, never of the world.When filmmakers put us in the world instead of the character, he/she can exploit a rich vocabulary of narrative games derived from noir. We stand as collaborators in defining the world that produces the pains we observe. We become guilty. This can be the most powerful of encounters in art, so when I see someone capable of it who ignores the opportunity in the name or moral cleanliness, I get disappointed.Even Tilda is uninteresting.2 Some interesting elements.",negative

Coherence,"This is a belated review, I missed the film on first release but am overjoyed a friend tipped me to it.This review done in 2017. The reason that is important is because I recently did a review of ARRIVAL in which I reviewed the history of the so-called ""smart"" sci-fi arcs (essentially, movies that make you really really THINK to enjoy them) and concluded that, of the bunch, ARRIVAL was the best.Had I seen coherence, however, my vote would have been different. It is hands down the ""smartest"" of the ""smart arcs"" I have ever seen and likely may ever see.Extraordinary.First, this film was produced on a shoestring, with an ensemble cast, and a lot of ad-libbed dialog. Extraordinary.Second, the editing is as tight as anything I have ever seen. The more attention you pay to what is happening, the more nervous you get. Extraordinary.Third (and pardon me for bringing in this topic) the science is far from crazy. The so-called ""Mandela Effect"" phenomenon happened in 2015 to 2016 (dozens of Youtube videos) and the attempts to explain it using quantum physics are very close to the explanations in this film. (In some of the Youtube videos, sufferers of the ME are crying into their webcams because their world has been turned upside down and they do not know why.) Finally, the acting is excellent, especially the lead, Emily Baldoni, who shows that she can carry an entire film with facial expressions and empathy ... and deserves much stronger roles than she has been getting.Extraordinary in every sense.",negative
Coherence,"A mind-bending and very entertaining independent science-fiction film, Coherence takes place over a single night in which a group of old friends (an ex-lovers) gather for a party on a night when a comet is expected to pass unusually close to the Earth. One of which is played by Nicholas Brendon of Buffy the Vampire Slayer in a scene-stealing role. I missed him.At first, glasses start breaking and cellphones shatter. Then the power goes off, except at one house down the street. Then there are strange bangs on the door and bizarre notes left at the house. Things get stranger when two of them decide to go to the lit-up house to make a phone call.It's a good film to me because the science-fiction concept ends up reflecting the real-life conflicts between the characters in a very clever way. I'm still not sure how I feel about the ending, but the film is a wild and entertaining ride before it gets there. Scenes propel themselves to other scenes with fast and snappy dialogue. Though it will be compared to films like Primer and Timecrimes, it's a pretty original film overall.",positive
Code 8,Actually okay - but definately a one-timer. Nice effects.,negative
Code 8,"Code 8 is a mix of Blade Runner (for the music style and the image texture and color) and X-Men for the scenario. It's a very good movie.
It's a little bit like if the director and the producers said « ok teenagers have the X-Men saga, let's do something around the same idea but for adults ».
The are no jaw dropping special effects, mutants (called ""person with abilities"" in the movie) dont do funky stuff.. every body acts great.. it's the kind of sci-fi movie that will very likely go unnoticed and it's a shame, it deserves much much more.",positive
The Circle,"Saw this movie yesterday, left very disappointed. I read some of the reviews so I wasn't expecting too much, but it was even worse than I had thought it would be. The writing was utterly terrible, the plot was poorly done, and even the acting was only decent, a surprising result considering the well-known cast. The overall concept of The Circle initially sounds interesting, but when explored in depth and presented through the film, multiple flaws can be found and at times, it almost seems ""stupid"". As the movie progresses, the main character's choices and actions seem contradictory to how she was introduced, and it becomes hard for the audience to relate to her and put themselves in her shoes. By the end of the movie, it became quite clear that The Circle had hoped to offer some profound social commentary on technology and human behaviour, but ultimately failed to do so by creating such a predictable and ""cheesy"" film. The dialogue was almost laughable at times, and there wasn't a single character that felt complex or real. While somewhat entertaining due to the futuristic depictions of technology and fast-paced plot, The Circle offers little more than that. Rather than provoke discussion or any deep thoughts after viewing, it leaves you with a large sense of disappointment and dissatisfaction with the way in which the writing and the story were carried out, as well as frustration with the immense amount of plot holes and motive flaws. Overall, The Circle tries to make a name for itself amongst the many ""dangers of technology"" movies, but as always, lazy writing and a poor and predictable plot can only lead to the disappointing result it ends up being. See The Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 instead. Anything else.",negative
The Circle,"It might be true that it's lacking on some things, has some cringe-worthy moments and Emma Watson is not that great of an actress honestly. But out of that, it's an interesting movie and it will definitely make you think, so no, don't avoid it as some people recommend.",positive
I Am Mother,"I enjoyed this movie. The second half does feel a little rushed and they didn't need all the action to make it thrilling.I've read some reviews calling out the timeline. They say according to the dates given daughter would be 38 years old. This would be true if she was the first embryo. But as it's relieved later she is not. But Hilary swank on the other hand could very possibly be 38 which is hinted at the end by Mother saying ""do you remember your mother?"" As to people complaining about wondering how Hilary swank survived its simple, mother made it so. If Mother had this whole thing planned out from day one then of course she made it possible for Hilary to survive on the outside probably in ways that were not obvious to her at the time.This movie did leave me wanting more. I would love to know how daughter takes on her new role as mother and what becomes of the new world!!The reason for the 8/10 is mostly for the second half. The actors were amazing and the overall idea was worth the watch.",negative
I Am Mother,"The biggest plot twist which would explain the entire movie is given out right in the beginning and verified multiple times throughout, then again at the ending.The '13867 days since extinction event' in the opening sequence indicates 38 years have past. Yet the daughter shown was only a teenager. That's because the women from outside was the 1st daughter ever... let me exlpain:During the middle of the film when the current daughter takes the exam + discovers that the robot mother had lied and killed 'failed' children before, it shows that her label is APX03, and APX02 have failed (incinerated), but 3 embryos were used from the lab... get it?The women from outside was APX01, the first ""daughter"", she matches the 38 years old timeline. Remember the robot said to her in the end ""wonder why you survived this long out here as if someone had a purpose for you? Until now"" Because she is the ultimate test to see if APX03 is truly ready to take on the role as mother for a new generation of humans (she returned hence passed the test so the robot left her alone). The women's memory was clearly altered/erased, that's why she totally couldn't respond when the robot said ""Tell me... Do you remember your mother?""Some more details...
1. The women sunk into a state of confusion when she saw the tonight show playing, and said she used to watch it a long time ago - her vague memories from living in the facility. She would never have seen it if she was out there for the whole 38 years. (Due to the end of civilization)
2. The women was meant to find the facility at that moment, everything was planned, including the bio suit, which obviously didn't need to exist otherwise.
3. This is speculation, but the women's artistic abilities might've been her training as a child. Remember the current daughter started prcating dancing since a young age? The robot recognized the importance of art and tries to incorporate that into each daughter's education.I created this account cuz I couldn't stand how many morons are saying negative things about the movie... including critics, sadly.",positive
Time Trap,"Okay...why does this movie have glowing reviews?The premise sounded great. It started off with some intrigue then it swings wildly into left field. The ""archeologist"" sounds moronic, the students are even worse. Don't even get me started on the cavemen. It's like watching a giant trainwreck. It's so bad that you just can't look away and the entire time you're watching you have a WTF reaction screwed permanently to your face.",negative
Time Trap,"While not going into a lot of unnecessary detail, I, somewhat forcibly, have a lot of free time on my hands and not a lot of options about what to do with it. I know, sounds like fun. It isn't.So I watch a lot of movies. Since great movies are fairly few, I end up watching a lot of trashy movies whether I like it or not. Low budgets, low-quality special-effects, low quality acting and etc. are a daily diet for me. I'm an expert on films where someone said, ""Hey! Let's make a movie in the barn!""TIME TRAP is a real rarity. While not a summer blockbuster or awards night darling, it somehow manages to be both cheap'n'cheesy and a really good, entertaining movie. It's proof that just because you have to make a movie with your allowance money doesn't mean the resulting flick has to be unwatchable.Perforce, the plot is very simple. If you think about it, nature is full of surprisingly large-scale booby-traps. As examples: the La Brea tar pits have trapped countless thousands of animals for literally tens of thousands of years (and even one human girl). Whole valleys located near volcanically active areas have seen entire populations of animals wiped out by escaping poison fumes. Even whole large-scale dinosaur nesting sites, complete with nesting dinosaurs and eggs, have been wiped out en masse by some natural disaster or other. Sinkholes and caves with vertical walls have been treasure troves of ancient animal skeletons trapped over thousands of years.And so on.Similarly, in TIME TRAP, we have a cave system that, for some unexplained reason, has varying levels of time ""bubbles"" within which time is operating on different scales relative to the larger, outside world. Anyone venturing within the cave system becomes ""trapped"" in the sense that while they are inside the cave system they are like bugs trapped in amber, effectively frozen in time while the outside world races ahead in ""normal"" timescale. Technically, people CAN leave, but if they've been within the cave system for any length of time beyond a minute or so, the outside world will have changed beyond recognition when they return to it.Many of the situations that you might imagine given such a plot description properly play out in the movie. Characters standing outside any time bubble (or within a ""faster"" time bubble) view other characters standing in other bubbles as either frozen statues or vanishing in an instant. Moving from one bubble to the next, characters who were looking like statues suddenly start moving. Throwing an object from one bubble to another sees that object suddenly freeze in midair. Standing inside a time bubble and looking out upon the outside world one sees the sun flashing by in streaks, very similar to what one sees in any time machine movie.Fascinatingly, again like bugs caught in amber, over the eons, humans from different eras and different levels of evolution have become ""trapped"" within the system. The characters which represent the protagonists in the movie encounter everything from cavemen to people from the future. There's one particular scene which depicts an ongoing free-for-all brawl occurring within an especially slow-moving time bubble featuring and including people from many different eras. Wonderfully imaginative.There are a few relative-time errors within the movie that the viewer has to turn a blind eye to in the name of poetic license. TIME TRAP is somewhat careful in laying out the speed of the time differential between the outside world and the main bubble that our protagonists are trapped within and then clearly violates those time relationships in order to play out some poignant scenes between some of the characters that know each other. Oh, well. Wink wink nudge nudge, give the makers a break. Considering how well they did with the rest of the picture, made with $1.95, I choose to let this one go. Most movies with these sorts of resource origins have too many screw-ups to count. All things considered, TIME TRAP does a pretty nice job with its premise.I gave this movie a 9/10 which some people might interpret as my claiming that it's on a par with RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK or something, which is not my intent. I simply feel that a low-end movie that rises so far above its station should be well rewarded. TIME TRAP is what it is, and judged relative to the other movies in the bargain bin it comes from, it is a sort of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK of the stand next to the checkout counter.",positive
Pacific Rim: Uprising,"Of course it will suck. if you see anyone from the Disney so-called Star Wars endless series just avoid the movie. It is simple.

The Vast of Night,"I wasn't expecting this. I thought it will be some kind of low budget story about Roswell, New Mexico, probably badly acted and with a formulaic plot. It was none of that. In fact, I am amazed on how careful they were with the details, the acting, the production in general. It is a story of alien encounter, but slow burning, focusing on the characters and the era. Quite frankly, I was blown away. It might feel kind of slow, but get into its rhythm and you will not get disappointed. The only thing that bothered me, ever so slightly, was that there was not enough focus on the actors' faces, it kept them a bit obscured. I am sure it was by design and part of the atmosphere of the story, but I wish it were lighted differently.Bottom line: if you like good sci-fi, people doing their best to build something beautiful and a film with meaning, watch this.P.S. It might be difficult to get through the first 15 minutes, they use a lot of American jargon from the 50s, but don't worry, what they are saying is not relevant to the story at large, it's just setting things up.",positive
Midnight Special,"This reminded me of a couple of films, namely Close Encounters and Starman, but with everything good about them ripped out, thrown on the floor and stamped on.What remained was an overall joyless experience as two sullen, largely monosyllabic mumbling men drove a kid with glowing eyes home for two hours. Of course they had a couple of hurdles to overcome but at no point do you think ""Oh no, they're not going to get the glowing eyed kid home"". Where previously films of this oeuvre have employed wit, humanity and a sense of wonder to fabulous effect the director of this sullen dross did little other than smash you repeatedly in the face shouting ""I AM SERIOUS, I AM IMPORTANT"" by making the repetitive turgid soundtrack blare progressively louder and louder. It was bombastic pseudo-intellectual rubbish masquerading as serious cinema.Just because everyone looks miserable and hardly anyone says anything doesn't automatically make something good. You have to have talent to pull that off and make people care about your morose protagonists despite themselves. Whereas the only comparable thing this nonsense succeeded in doing was making me like a guy from the NSA, basically because he was the only one who seemed capable of speaking in entire sentences and looking slightly interested in what was going on.I'd rather be forced to sit and watch E.T over and over again Clockwork Orange style for a week than expose myself to this inane garbage again.

I love my apocalyptic movies and after the first 20 minutes I thought it wasn't going so bad... decent special effects, seeing what each ""wave"" was going to do and I was looking forward to seeing ""the others"", but alas that was it for the movie after that it was like opening a teen magazine while jamming a skewer up my nose in to my brain.I must say I did get a few laughs at the many clichés I called before they happened followed by my swift exit to save my brain from rotting by the absurd stupidity of it all.

Jupiter Ascending,"The movie feels like it was written by a ten year old girl hooked on drugs. Cardboard characters are so undeveloped that they should have stayed in authors womb for few more months/years. Bad acting and ""I don't care about what is going on"" attitude from the actors brings final nail to this movie coffin. There is nothing substantial in this movie, nothing that can teach us something new about ourselves or the world around us, which is quite odd for the science fiction movie. True the cinematography of the movie is first class, but it only saddens me that it is used on such bad material. In the end don't get fooled by this movie. Its only purpose is to take your money with bright lights and a false promise, but it will leave you with a mouth full of ash, wondering why you wasted your time.",negative
Jupiter Ascending,"Brilliant, absolutely brilliant! For me, this is one of the best movies in history of cinema. If you did not see it already, then go to the cinema and watch it before you read further. I apologize for my not so polished English. It's not my first language, and I'm still learning it.I went to the cinema with almost no information about this movie. All I know was its a sci-fi. I had no clue who plays in it, or who directed it. First surprise came at the ticket booth. The ticket price was around 15% higher then any other movies I have seen*. This must be a real good movie... After twenty minutes I was already bored by the clichés. East European emigrant in USA with huge dreams, became a toilet cleaner, but soon she will be saved by a werewolf and she will be some kind of princess of the ""world"". What an original idea... As some other reviewers pointed out, the movie is full of scenes borrowed from other movies and video games, as far as I see. Scenes, music, sound effects. Everything. Stunning visual effects, but shallow story and almost non existent character development. For the first sight... After an hour I could not believe that I paid for this... This was the first movie I was trying to sleep in.At the end there was a single sentence that stuck in my head: time is the single most precious thing in the universe. Funny, a film seemingly completely waste of time talks about your precious time.With friends we talk about the movie for an hour. The conclusion: it is so pointless that this must be the point.Then, next day it hit me! It hit me so hard, first I had to sit down, then I was walking around in my room for a half hour. This movie is like a huge puzzle. It makes no sense until you find the corner pieces. I think I found one of those pieces. TIME, the single most precious thing in the universe. This movie is about Us, about how we live, about how we waste our precious time. Its about the clichés filling our life.The first thought of her at morning: ""I hate my life!"" Didn't you ever thought that? Her mother and aunt works dutifully, like robots. They are the modern slaves of our days. She is dreaming about a better life, about expensive clothes, while the rich girl can not decide which cloth she should wear when her rich boyfriend will ""ask her"" to merry him. We all know this will not happen, but she believes it. She wants to be a wife of a rich guy. A toilet cleaner emigrant with brand new iPhone? We are working to get money, to buy things we can not afford. Her uncle practically try to sell her body parts – eggs- and take most of the money, just because ""this is capitalism"". Spending money before you have it. Anyone? He spends on what? Big screen TV and video games. Things he can not afford, but he thinks it will change his life. He waste money so he can wast more time. ...these are just the first few minutes!It contains countless references to movies, video games, books, to different parts of popular culture, even religions. In every scene you can find parts of other movies, games, books. Just watch it and find your pieces.We are products, just as depicted in the movie. We are just numbers on some rich and powerful peoples spreadsheet. We are money machines. Do you think most movies are made for us? NO! Most movies are made for profit. Look at the movies of the last decade. They can sell a movie with a shallow story,and stunning visuals. They can sell it with an actor. They can sell it with just a name behind it. Most people praise this movie for the stunning visuals, Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum (their bodies, not their act). Here is a movie with so deep meanings, that almost no one notices. Its not hidden. It pokes our eyes. But we can't see it. There were so many meaningless movies in the last decade, we can't see any difference. We don't even expect movies with any deeper meaning. Most of the movies and video games are just escapes from our life.I feel I need to say a few more words about the end of the movie to make it round. Did you noticed, she was smiling at the end, even while cleaning the toilet? She was not whining about her life any more. She wake up early, made coffee, and she was happier when she got that old brass telescope then when she become the absolute ruler of the Earth. She did change, but not the way you expected. She enjoys the little details of the life. Enjoys her work, even if its toilet cleaning, enjoys the morning coffee with her family, the noisy dinner. For me, it seems like, she understood that time is our single most precious thing in the universe. She enjoys every moment of her life :)As I said, this movie es a brilliant piece of art. It is about our life. You just need to find a corner piece of the puzzle. I showed one piece for you! Wake up Neo! Now go, waste some more of your precious time, watch this movie again, and find your corner pieces, make your puzzle complete :) I will do the same. I have to watch this again...Thank you for your precious time, I hope it worth reading :)PS*: probably the higher ticket price was just a coincidence. But it made more impact. The pain of wasting my time was stronger.",positive
Power Rangers,"This reboot is by far one of the worst I have seen. I grew up in the 90s and my love for power Rangers was dear. If you are an original fan please DO NOT watch. The film was sexualized and at times a little disturbing. This remake is for a whole new generation. If this is what we are producing for the next generation then this is unsettling. The audience In the movie seemed to enjoy this movie but as an original fan I had to walk out half way. The actors performed more on a chessy, no acting skills level. The villain was a tormented individual with no talent. Zordon was completely different, more of an aggressive angry frustrated personality. That alone made me walk out, original Zordon was patient, wise, and kind. I believe we got 15 minutes of fighting if that in this 2 hour movie. Everything that was once positive about the series, was completely missing in the movie. Sad to say, the new Power Rangers movie was a disaster.",negative
Power Rangers,"Anyone that was a child when the Power Rangers was on TV will be early 30's to late early 40's. Writing a review based on your memories stating that this movie destroyed the Power Rangers of old time is just sad.I actually liked it and yes I am one of those kids. The movie is very simple. They are building up the characters, each being a misfit, they are teenagers so YES you will get a lot of the teenager drama that comes along with being a teenager. It is pretty much an Origin Superhero movie, slow at start but ending with a Bang when the heroes discover their full potential.Why would anyone compare this to the Transformers? It is filmed the same way, the special effects are pretty much the same but this is because at the end of the day they have similarities (robots, transforming) and they can only show them one way. Bear in mind that Power Rangers type of series have been around since the 70s and 80s especially in Japan and China. So NO they did not copy Transformers and the first Power Ranger movie was actually done before any of the Transformers movies. Unfortunately any movie that shows big robots and morphings will be compared to the Transformers.The movie does keep true to the original series and I have enjoyed it. I also liked seeing some of the original rangers in the crowd.Does it deserve a 10? Probably not but neither does a 1 nor do other waste of time movies/series deserve a 10. Your kids will enjoy it and so will you.",positive
Mute,"Since Moon entered my top five in 2009 (it's still there by the way), I've been eagerly waiting for Duncan Jones to make Mute, which acts as a companion piece instead of a direct sequel. I enjoyed Source Code, but I gave Warcraft a miss because it's a video game adaptation, and they've never been worth the price of admission.As sublime as it is, it looks like Moon might have been a fluke. I had high hopes for Mute, but it's like Jones took a first-year student film script and somehow got millions of dollars to make it. It's a horrendously disjointed, bloated disaster whose plot would be boring in a normal setting, and is downright wasted in the world in which it's set. Is this what it was like when The Phantom Menace was released?",negative
Mute,"When I saw the initial reviews, I immediately prepared for disappointment.
Turns out, the movie was great. Easily 7 to 7.5 and maybe a narrow 8/10 for me. It is technically above average, 3/10 is plain ridiculous.I have to say this film is more drama than thriller.
And yes, it can use a bit of refinement on pacing, and does lack a bit of punch.
However, it did tug on my heartstrings on certain spots, and showcased a range of complex relationships and emotions between the characters.
It's great fun because in the end, its hard to tell who the villain is.
I say this as a person who appreciates Drama and slow tempo Art films.This film is not meant to be:
1) a blockbuster thriller
2) a hard Sci Fi that pushes philosophical questionsRather, it is more of a drama / tragedy that effectively uses the Sci Fi backdrop to highlight the contrasting character of the protagonist Leo. Who is a sensitive soul and a man pure at heart who is unaffected by all the neon signs and the madness that surrounds him.",positive

Kong: Skull Island,"I grew up watching classic monster movies at my Great Grandma's place - Wolfman, Creature from the Black Lagoon, The Blob, etc. This movie made me feel the enjoyment of discovering those movies again.I liked the fact that the movie was chronological, and made it very obvious when it changed time or place. I hate flashbacks, and am happy to be able to say that this movie did not make use of them. Thankfully, it also did not make use of the ""shaky camera footage"" that a lot of movies are using these days.Some big monster movies also tend to be kind of slow at the beginning, and hide the ""main character"" until towards the end of the movie. Not so with this - Kong makes his appearance right at the beginning. The movie also doesn't really bog down anywhere. On the other hand, there are plenty of movies that scream ""eye candy"" - where it seems quite obvious that there is not much of a plot, so they are just throwing things around to distract you. While the focus of this movie is definitely on the giant monster battles, it is done very well.Both my wife and I give this film an A+ - it's a nicely done foundation for the upcoming Kong vs Godzilla film.",positive
Criminal,"I only gave it 3 because of Gal Gadot and Ryan, otherwise it would be a total 0, if there was less than 0, this movie would get it from me.How did the producers get so many known actors to appear in this failure of a movie i cannot even imagine, and i have a very good imagination, never mind appearing, acting so terrible. Gary Oldman as the most ridiculously stupid CIA director gives a performance that is so bad, can there really be such stupid people in top CIA positions? judge for yourself - if you happen to be paid to watch this garbage.Kevin Costner as the criminal? you are joking!!!!!!TLJ as the doctor! OMG! what performance! why waste this actor on this?And the master criminal! sitting in some hole controlling the world! not even a proper chair is provided for him! in a room without walls or any furniture, like a homeless guy! and, this richest man in the world has a private plane that even starting drug dealers have better!Very badly directed by this Ariel who probably tries to build a name for himself as an action films director, and fails in every way. To sum it up: garbage.",negative
Criminal,"I despise movies where the premise is beyond credible. So after reading the reviews I decided I did not want to see another Face Off type transplant story. But wow, was I ever wrong. What I was missing is one of the best characters ever created by an actor and that was Kevin Costner's doing. He develops a totally believable and absolutely impeccable portrait of a sick psychopath who is greatly affected by an unapproved medical procedure. What is great is that he is not politically correct, weak, or conflicted. It makes him incredibly interesting in the age of weak males pandering to everyone. He gets to glimpse a normal life through the eyes of a strong man who is also moral which is the Ryan Reynolds character. He also gets to feel the love of a daughter and beautiful wife which he had never known before. All of the actors are great but Costner raised my opinion of his acting ability by a mile. The story and production is also excellent with an ending that is quite satisfying.",positive
Pacific Rim,"I went into the theater expecting to see a cartoon for adults and that is exactly what I paid for.Guillermo Del Toro is an extremely talented director, producer and above all an extraordinary artist. Pan's Labyrinth gave justice to his talents and ""The Strain trilogy"" exemplifies his talents as a creator and innovator of interesting mind-grabbing stories/plots.However, Pacific Rim was a horrible movie not only because it lacked substance (a clear plot, climax, resolution), but because it proved to audiences everywhere that Hollywood no longer requires decent actors and plot-lines to create a blockbuster movie.The only intricacies and attention to detail that could be found in this movie was in the CG design of the so called Jaegers (Robots). Yet, the movie served to ignore the basic human sense of sight when most of the movie took place in a dark setting. It was a metaphor of how the movie itself was a black hole of cash and talent with all the darkness sucking and robbing people of their investments and experiences.An episode of Beast Wars that I watched as a young child had more substance and gave more satisfaction to its audience than this movie. Pacific Rim is a destruction to the art of cinematography in that its business model lies in providing the awe-factor, shocking the audience into believing the movie is great with bling. Expensive jewelry doesn't make a woman more beautiful, it just proves that she has the money to afford it, and that is exactly what Pacific Rim accomplished.The movie is just a failure of epic proportions and the fact that it rates a 7.9 on IMDb just proves that we, the collective audience, have just stopped caring. Movies no longer provide us with mind-blowing catharsis, they are now just a means of blowing off steam.",negative
Pacific Rim,"For the first time in many, many years with this movie I was taken away from the problems in my life and went to a place where those things didn't register anymore. It was almost magical. I had to keep reminding myself about the bad things in real life, but then a new robot vs monster battle happened and all the sudden that didn't matter any more. Total escapism done with excellent design attention and detail. Thank you GDT. You have to be an artist and a science fiction geek to appreciate this. I came out of the movie and realized all my problems were still there but I was also hearing the theme music in my head. Got the DVD now and I escape that way. Channel your inner six year old, lean back and enjoy.",positive
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,"Here is a list of positives and negatives for this film:CONS:
Massive, glaring plot holes.
Unrelateable and emotionless actors.
Total genre confusion.
Plot almost completely detached from the world of Pokémon.
Constant exposition.
Mostly terrifying looking Pokémon.
Total target audience confusion.
Unresolved plot points.
Lifeless dialogue.
Flat jokes across the board.
Very little detecting for a movie with 'detective' in the title.
(And much more if I were to nitpick.)PROS
Some of the Pokémon are cute.
???I sense the majority of these high reviews are symptoms of ""I see Pokémon, I vote 10"", because even when ignoring the late 2000s looking CGI for most of the Pokémon, 'Pokémon: Detective Pikachu' is a severely flawed film with a total lack of plot, interesting characters or real conflict.",negative
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,"We saw this movie at one of the AMC early preview shows on May 2nd, and I'm so glad we did.
Why? Because ""video game movies"" are something that historically were a ""wait til it's on TV"" type of thing - no real reason to see them on the big screen; they weren't much different than the games they came from.
Detective Pikachu, on the other hand, is an actual movie. Yes, it's set in a world where Pokémon actually exist, and this one can talk to both humans and Pokémon (Doctor Doolittle, anyone?), but unlike a ""video game movie"", the plot isn't just a vehicle for the setting. It's an actual mystery/adventure, with characters you come to care about, both human and not. Twists and surprises and feels. All the parts of a great flick.
One thing that surprised me was how I was amazed by the emotions expressed by the Pikachu character - not only did he feel ""real"" in the movie, his face, ears, body language conveyed emotion clearly and strongly. It's hard to explain, it was kind of like a cross between looking at a child and a puppy... I don't know how they did it, but when Pikachu was saddened, you *felt* it; when happy, you knew it...
Finally, I also do have to say that all of us were concerned about the ""Deadpool factor"" - which turned out to be a non-issue. Ryan Reynolds is a great actor, and like any great actor, you only see and hear the character he's playing - not his past ones.
Excellent movie for all ages, even if you're not a Pokémon fan, you'll enjoy it.",positive
Riddick,"I've been unimpressed by the Riddick franchise, I think Pitch Black (2000) was both where it started and it peaked.This final entry was rather a surprise, who'd have thought that they'd have made another movie considering how badly Chronicles of Riddick (2004) bombed? Partially funded by Diesel himself it's hard to argue his commitment to the project.So almost a decade after the last full entry (Not including the animations) we pick up where we left off. Riddick is Grand Marshall of the Necromongers but things quickly go south after they turn on him and leave him for dead.The plot is actually sound as is the general creation of the movie. I found myself impressed which I certainly didn't expect. The movie is more akin with Pitch Black than Chronicles of Riddick, they clearly went back to the drawing board and the movie is considerably better for it.On a budget out about quarter of the previous movie it's shocking just how much better it all looks, in fact every aspect is superior. Also starring the excellent Katee Sackhoff I was gripped more than I had been since the first movie, it was really quite enjoyable.Fairly early on however I was hoping that a certain death wouldn't occur, I knew if it did then the movie would be damaged beyond repair and about halfway through my fear materialised. Had this event not transpired you'd have me just ranting about how much of a wonderful surprise Riddick was and how much I enjoyed it. Instead I'll say it's the second best movie in the franchise, but should have been the best. Poor decision making killed the film and has left it merely passable.Good addition despite the hefty flaw.The Good:Katee SackhoffLooks considerably better than the previous film which had 4 times the budgetWell played out storyThe Bad:""That"" death should not have happenedSets up for a sequel that will never comeThings I Learnt From This Movie:Even in the future on other planets people are stupid enough to smoke",negative
Riddick,"I really don't get some people. Everyone was saying how Chronicles was so much more different than Pitch Black (which personally I don't find a negative thing)and they should have stuck to something more like Pitch Black. Then Riddick comes out and people are saying its like watching Pitch Black again. Make up your minds people !Second, if you're expecting this movie to win an Oscar, please don't watch it. It's a sci fi movie with action, killing, fighting and blood. If you got any problem with any of those I don't know why you paid for a ticket really.The movie itself was very good. I've been waiting a looong time for this movie to come out. I've watched the other two Riddick movies waaayyyy too many times for me to remember. If you're a Riddick fan or feel like watching a kick-ass movie then I would recommend going to see Riddick. You don't really need to have watched the first two movies, but I would recommend seeing them anyway if you haven't.",positive
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"The Hunger Games story continues with the third installation, Mockingjay. And it's about as padded and needlessly long as every other two-parter we've had since the studio executives came up with this money-grabbing monstrosity of an idea.Not to say you shouldn't see this one if you've liked the previous Hunger Games films. This continues the story just fine. Jennifer Lawrence still shines as Katniss Everdeen. Her presence and talent hold us through even through scenes you instantly recognize as needless padding and waste of our money. The returning cast is also as talented as they've always been and most of the new characters are also casted without hitches. Julianne Moore is perhaps a bit too... Julianne Moore to play President Coin 100 percent convincingly, but she has certain presence as well, that cannot be denied.What bugs me is the story. The book itself was the weakest of the trilogy, though not by much, and it seems that its faults bleed into the film. Especially because the iron tight pace of the previous installations is thrown straight out of the window and we spent most of our time building up atmosphere. And building. And building. And... You get the point. There's very little bang for your buck here and even when something substantial happens, it simply lacks that edge.Plus, they had the perfect closing scene, and for some reason they decided to keep going for about five minutes. Trust me, you know where they should have ended it when you've seen the movie.This is a good movie. It still looks great, the main actors are brilliant and it has enough depth to impress through its story alone. I just wish they had had the integrity to go with one movie. It very well might have been the best Hunger Games movie of the three. It would have had two movies before it to build up momentum and steam. Instead it lifts up the pedal from the gas and decides to stroll over the finish line. Poor form, extremely poor form.",negative
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"In general, the drama part of the story is the movie. It is off by the action. Again new characters were included. The film is not able to spend permanent staff.
The song ""The Hanging Tree"" was very beautiful. Also the sarcastic bird melody is already perfect. It was a troubled film that could have been nice.",positive
Brightburn,"This pathetic movie bills itself as ""Superman gone Bad."" And when I heard that tagline I was intrigued enough to buy a ticket - something I now regret.
Because this isn't a bad Superman - it's just a bad movie.Here's the entire plot: A mindless orgy of hyperviolence and grisly murder by an alien child with superpowers. That's it. You now know the entire movie.There is no backstory, no explanation for the child's homicidal mania. He's just a crazy superpowered murder-machine. The director has no need for story. Instead, he's content to maximize blood & gore - taking great pleasure in depicting each murder with excessive detail. Amplified sounds of crushing bones, bodies suddenly blasted to pieces, close up shots of glass chunks jamming into eyeballs, death-ray vision blowing holes in people's heads.My advice is to skip this movie entirely and instead watch the terrific 1956 film ""The Bad Seed."" It's also about a murderous child, but is told skillfully and persuasively - and was nominated for 4 Academy Awards. You might also check out Episode 73 of ""The Twilight Zone"" (1961). Titled ""It's a Good Life,"" it is a compelling glimpse into the mind of an impulsive 6-year-old child with deadly superpowers. It stars Billy Mumy as the awful child, and Cloris Leachman & John Larch as his very frightened parents. Unfortunately the director of ""Brightburn"" never saw either of these two excellent productions - because if he had, he would have quickly realized he needed to include a story . . . .",negative
Brightburn,"Rating 10/10
He's Not Here To Save The World !! Surprisingly entertaining. This movie is just amazing and the acting from everyone was great. Excellent acting performance by Jackson A.Dunn a.k.a Brandon Breyer & Elizabeth Banks a.k.a Tori Breyer !! Brightburn is a strong proof that even during the crappy horror times, there comes a film to scare the hell out of you. It definitely worth to watch !!",positive
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,"I want 2 hours of my life back! It was tedious, linear, uneventful, predictable, and dialogues often scrambled. This is not the worst film I ever saw, but I've seen lots of films, and this episode is perhaps the 4th worst ever. From top of my head I can name a few more bearable things. Say, IRS. I mentioned drying paint before. Even hangover can be more fun. Or toothache. Walking the streets alone, minding my own business is immensely more fun. To spare myself from future torture, I'll make sure to check the IMDb comments first, sorting them by the ""hated it"" criterion. Why suffer? I just hope my comment will save at least one person from suffering.",negative
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,"The movie is a lot like I anticipated it to be. Special effects, plot and acting is like all its other installments, amazing. Having read the book, there are obviously scenes and parts that were 'left out' just like all the other movies that have been adapted from a novel. Especially the Mockingjay, being the last book of the trilogy, there is no room for denial that there are way too many events or scenes to incorporate in the movie. Despite that, the movie was still a thriller. Being dubbed as a war movie, there were several parts in the movie that left me on the edge of my seat, proving the movie to be action-packed. Kudos to Jennifer Lawrence for her role as Katniss Everdeen, she portrayed her exactly as Collins did in the novel throughout the whole series. The way she displayed her emotions showed no other actress could fill her void as Katniss.Part 2 however was missing a slight 'oomph' that many were expecting. Francis Lawrence wanted the movie to be exactly like the book. Yes he did achieve that, but having done that he left some important bits out. A lot of the characters in the previous movie were sidelined, like Haymitch, Effie and quite importantly, Prim. Prim was killed in the movie and her being the major reason why this story emerged, her death lacked the emotional feel that it had in the book. A possible reason behind this was because Lawrence was too focused on making this a war movie that he left behind the emotional impact on the deaths of Katniss' close family and friends. When Katniss' squad members were killed, all of them lacked the 'feel' of when someone dies, that was mainly because Francis Lawrence didn't really portray Katniss' feelings about them when they died. Yes, the movie should be as close as the book describes the plot, but to make it a better movie than it was, Francis should of shown more scenes of Prim (and of course others like Haymitch and etc) to remind the audience that she still exist and to build that tension and emotional impact we're supposed to get when Prim gets killed. In some parts of the movie when Prim or Haymitch and etc re-occurred, it kinda felt they came out of nowhere and suddenly one of them dies and I guess that sorta flawed the movie a little. On the other hand it is a huge contrast to Part 1, where it was full of emotions and less action packed, which might of been intended.On the whole, Part 2 was an amazing movie, one I'd definitely watch again, enjoyed it very much, made me proud as a hunger games fan. The twisted and depressing ending to what a lot of people thought would be a fairy tail closure is one of the many things that makes Mockingjay part 2 one of the best movies to end a franchise. Hope it smashes the blockbuster records. Part 2 ended the Hunger Games installment on a very high note. Really hoping that there's some sort of sequel or prequel!!!",positive
Gravity,"The big ""spoiler"" is that this is a big budget Hollywood move with a preposterous plot and lots of special effects. The problem here is that nobody could possible survive through any of this, and the special effects become a substitute for any meaningful plot. Even taken on its own terms, the movie makes no sense. Sandra Bullock has become an astronaut but lacks even the basic skills for that occupation. She tells us she always crash landed the flight simulator, and we find her thumbing through an instruction manual about the size of the instructions for a DVD player to figure out how to safely pilot a space craft back to earth. She even picks the buttons eeny, meany, miney, mo style. Add to this the contrived scenario that she has not only lost a child but also is ""revived"" and given a reason to live by the now dead George Clooney appearing in a dream sequence. And how great a movie can it really be where there is only one character (and almost no dialog) on camera for most of the film. The special effects are impressive, but what they've obviously done is use computer graphics to create all the weightless effects. As such, things remain weightless even when they shouldn't be, and you eventually become more interested in looking for the screw-ups than watching the movie. Please, please, please. Will someone make a movie with a clever plot that keeps you guessing to the end and with interesting and passably believable characters.",negative
Gravity,"This is yet another movie demonstrating space for many new viewers, IN THE WRONG WAY. If you set aside the horrible acting and the obviously written-in-a-day plot, all you have left is a steaming heap of special effects and sound editing that is designed to rope in young or stupid movie viewers, these days they are synonymous. This is essentially Sanctum(2011) cloned, set in space, with worse acting, and less intelligence. This movie had it's accurate moments, a rarity among cinema, but the creators also dropped the ball hard on many of the physics in the movie. Any of you that have studied physics and understand the concept of a vacuum, please stand up.Spoilers ahead!~~This genre is very hard to get followers as it is, but why oh why would you cast two of the worst possible people that could portray astronauts and then proceed to have them read lines that are most likely written by some guy that has absolutely no knowledge of internal conflict. Okay so here we go. -Does anyone truly believe that, during a SCHEDULED maintenance mission to a prestigious satellite like the Hubble, Russia would have been operating in the same level of orbit? OR if that doesn't hit it home, detonations are not executed in geosynchronous orbit EVER for fear of permanent debris OR how about did the engineers of either Russia or America randomly think that,"" hmm so we are going to blow up something in orbit(to reiterate this does not happen) and there absolutely won't be a chain reaction that causes the I.S.S. or the future C.S.S. to receive damage"" NO because this just won't happen ever. -Why would NASA, assuming this is our time line (she mentions Huston, which is mission control) have authorized this woman(Bullock) for space operations if she is so prone to be mentally disabled in a crisis?(loss of child, apparently no significant other or family, seems depressed so the psych. eval. would have failed) -Why if after being approved for a mission to orbit(which requires ridiculous amounts of training), would this certified astronaut and specialist(most likely an electrical engineer, which happens to be my profession), be so idiotic in a situation as grievous as this. I mean there are well over a dozen times that she seems to have the capabilities of a high school dropout. -I know this is a movie but damn, the cliché's are killing me softly. Ripley is the only solo-heroine of the space genre, sorry Sandra. Also the hallucination cliché ,cough, movie isn't over, cough, she gets away unscathed,cough.In conclusion, yes the special effects depict earth well and the debris/fire-in-zero-g was pretty good, it is clear that the budget went to the cg. The downfall is that space is big, this genre NEEDS exploration, not just our atmosphere! There is a big reason why media like Star Trek has staying power, and why many of the viewers and readers can obtain a lasting memory by stopping by NASA's website and read testimonials of astronauts and see pictures from satellites etc. This movie is just a hyped up 1.5 hours of cg with a terrible script and bad acting, that has nothing to give to the space genre. Sorry Hollywood, but until you give us the desire, you won't get viewers hooked on bad space movies. Sincerely yours, concerned techie.",positive
Independence Day: Resurgence,"TL;DR: It was actually boring. There was a story here that had potential but it was let down by terrible acting, bad dialog, no story or character development at all and, ultimately, no soul to this one. 3 points for above average special effects, -7 for just an awful movie. Netflix this one.Edition watched: 3D IMAXIn 1996's Independence Day, Bill Pullman's speech hit you emotionally somewhere. Even if that emotion was disgust, you had a reaction. All of Will Smith's one liners made you cringe or laugh. No matter how much you may deny it publicly, Randy Quaid's end put a lump in your throat the first time you saw it. There was soul to that movie, even though it was an ensemble cast, characters were developed, the story progressed and there were heroes you cheered for and aliens you despised.None of that was present in 2016's Independence Day. All the new actors were either bad or terrible. I didn't care if the aliens won or lost. Not only were the new actors bad but some of the dialog they were forced to work with was just terrible. Jessie T. Usher's character has a few key lines that are supposed to hearken back to those emotional one liners from Will Smith in 1996, such as: ""Welcome to Earth!"". Yet Usher delivered those lines in such a deadpan, soulless way that made me wonder if he thought he was supposed to be playing an emotionless android. Then you have my favorite emotionless android actor Brent Spiner, who is someone I know to be a quality actor, yet the dialog and scenes with him were so bad I had to wonder for a second if all his previous work was done by a twin. I could go on, but the acting and dialog were just parts of the problem. There was no character development at all. They simply tried to cram too much into this movie. From the constant pandering to a Mainland Chinese audience (unnecessary scenes that should have been used for any kind of plot or character development) to Vivica A. Fox's minuscule screen time, there was too much shoved into this 120 min movie which ended up making it a big mess that went nowhere. In the end, I formed no attachment to any of the new characters and was detached from old characters that I once cheered for.The most damning thing though is, despite all the explosions and this alien invasion, there was no excitement. I was bored. There was a girl in front of me texting and using FB messenger and I found myself involuntarily lifting my 3D glasses and reading her text chain and messenger thread till I caught myself and put my glasses back on. Her inane chatter about how boring this movie was, her cat, the guy she was sitting next to and so forth were more interesting to me than the movie on the huge IMAX screen was.As a huge fan of alien invasion movies, I walked out feeling like this was such a huge opportunity wasted. If you told me the basic story of this move yesterday, I would've been ecstatic to see a trilogy. Now I hope the 3rd one dies in production and they put the money to a Battle Los Angeles 2.",negative
Independence Day: Resurgence,"every movie must have a useless Chinese actor/actress and loads of Chinese product placement. How lame. Chollywood is so lame. I watched this until the 240-minute mark and I honestly couldn't handle anymore. I love science fiction, but this movie is even worse than the Disney Star Wars crap... such a piece of crap. The tacky Chinese chick... how do they pick them? Just plain popularity so it sells in China or do they do cheap low quality Chinese casting couch? She was such a bad pick for this. I don't even care whether or not she slept with someone because I am a man...I just care that she failed to capture the role she's playing and actually she has no role. I don't recommend anyone watches the film. Who knew China has Independence Day?",positive
Ant-Man and the Wasp,"Even though I enjoyed the first one as a comedy movie itself (and not a hero movie, more like an ""introduction"" movie into becoming some sort of hero), it was ""ok"" for me the fact that they inserted a very generic, uninteresting, forgettable villain in it (by now we always expect this kind of villain in MCU introduction movies).Well, this time they expanded the team into Ant-man + Wasp, which was nice. But that was the only main change (besides the after-credit scene). They still managed to create the same structure of the previous movie, instead of a ""hero movie""...again a comedy movie... instead of a well developed villain, again the same uninteresting and forgettable villain.Personally I think I lost money watching it since it was again more of the same, maybe I have should waited until it was on Netflix or something.",negative
Ant-Man and the Wasp,"Loved everything about this movie. I can't imagine all the negative reviews from people complaining about storyline and acting. This is a Marvel comic turned movie so what great meaningful story can you expect. This is supposed to be sheer entertainment and it checks all the right boxes. Comedy, Action, brilliant Special Effects and really likeable characters. This movie was way better than the first part.",positive
Bumblebee,Honestly thought this movie would be pretty good. The beginning of the movie is awesome but then they make 75% of the movie about the girl I went to see a movie about bumblebee not her. My favorite part was when he picked her up and put her in the dumpster.,negative
Bumblebee,"Bumblebee is the 'unofficial' sixth installment in the Transformers' franchise and it is actually a spin-off. I bought the DVD before coming back home last week, with the idea that it would be a good family movie, and I was far from being wrong. This is not only a great film to watch with the kids, but also the best episode in the saga. 'Bumblebee' takes us back to the year 1987, and it looks and smells like if it was made in the 1980s with a great cast and an awesome soundtrack. I am listening to it while I am writing this review and I am already looking forward to watching 'Bumblebee 2' in theaters in 2022.",positive
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,"A completely unsuitable lead actor ruined this otherwise great story. WHAT on earth were the casting directors thinking about when they chose this guy to be there lead actor. It's not for a moment believable that he pulls off all these brave, daring, tough guy stuff. Neither is the on-screen romance believable between this loser and the lead actress.The lead actress was also unsuitable for the role but perhaps not as bad. No body would look at these two and say ""I want to be like them or look like them or be in their shoes"" let alone wanting to follow them for two hours and twenty minutes. Surely $180 million could have secured proper casting. I am pondering for the first time about how crucial it is too have competent casting.The choice of film title was also disastrous. They should have chosen a shorter name with more impact.",negative
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,"The details, the vast city, the artwork and the effects and the beautiful girl that constantly teases us because she does not show enough skin or puts out. WOW. Deserves an 8/10.",positive
The Bad Batch,"Jim Carrey is uncredited. I wondered why. Then I watched the movie.Thing is, I watched the first 20 minutes, then put it aside, thinking that my wife's sister's family, who are fans of edgy cinema and were soon to visit us, would be down for an aprés apocalypse mindfock like this.They, like me, enjoyed the first 20 minutes. Hardly any dialogue (in a good way), some nice directorial flourishes, a more than adequate set up. Lots of promise. A good skeleton on which to put some meat.A young woman is banished to a lawless territory in the desert, is kidnapped by what turns out to be a community of iron-pumping cannibals, has an arm and a leg amputated (and her wounds cauterized, presumably so that the rest of her can also be eaten or, you know, otherwise put to use), then manages to free herself and find her way to a place called Comfort where the people eat noodles and chicken instead.I assumed what would follow would be a story of revenge and rescue, the goodies of Comfort taking down the baddies at the Venice Beach barbecue, maybe with some explanation as to how the people of Comfort get access to gasoline, photocopiers, rice noodles and all the recreational pharma you could hope for. (My guess was that there would be some connection to a group outside the lawless land, perhaps some sort of probably not-so-kosher arrangement between Keanu Reeves's Jim Jones knockoff and his inworld suppliers.)No answers came. None.Despite a severe underbite, Jim Carrey managed to chew what little scenery there was and he was still the best thing in the film by a long walk. The moment he hands Momoa a snowglobe was when I knew I wasn't coming back. The movie had left me in my own offworld without a clue where I was going or what would happen to me when I got there.Loooong story short, the girl falls in love with Momoa's Atkins aficionado after eating some Guatemalan insanity peppers and tripping out like she ate a bad oatmeal cookie at a Grateful Dead concert.There's some other stuff. A kid who likes spaghetti elbows more than actual elbows and who cries when her Daddy and her new stepmom eat her pet rabbit; a homeless philosopher dude played by Ribisi, channeling an amalgam of all those fidgety weirdos that Brad Pitt used to play; and almost no dialogue not spoken by Reeves, whose explanation of where his dookie go goes on for about nine minutes.But it is bad enough to be a fun watch with friends who like movies made without scripts by people who can't make a movie without a script. Which is most people.Seriously, I want to know the backstory to this debacle. My guess: Super-talented young director makes great movie, gets noticed, then gets one of those bags with the two dollar signs on it and access to Harvey Weinstein's rolodex while he's in the bath. But the movie has to be made in 10 days because Jim has a showing of his larger canvases at a gallery where people will hand him bags with two dollar signs on them because he's Jim Carrey, not because he's actually a talented sculptor and painter.Or Jim shook the snowglobe and handed it to the director, saying (with only his eyes), ""Before the snow has settled within, the script must be written.""",negative
The Bad Batch,"I like movies like this. It's slow, kinda. It's got cannibals, an apocalyptic-like wasteland, dismemberment, weird characters and a great soundtrack. I think all the bad reviewers watch too many Marvel movies. It's just an arty cannibal movie, with a bunch of limbless girls wandering around. Only thing it's lacking is chainsaws, but most movies are lacking those anyways.",positive
Big Hero 6,"Thankfully not the sixth film in a sextuplet, Big Hero 6 is the latest visually dazzling Disney film since the studio's resurgence. I was not a fan of Frozen, deeming it inferior to Pixar's elite animation masterpieces, and the feature- length music video to 'Let it Go' was mildly enjoyable at best. However, Big Hero 6 is much more fun, with science prodigy Hiro Hamada (voiced by Ryan Potter) forming a bond with his brother's home-made ""huggable"" robot invention Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit) and subsequently creating a team of superheroes to combat a masked villain with a nefarious motive (it's way better than I just made it sound.)The best part about Big Hero 6 is undoubtedly one of 2014's cutest characters. An ever so slightly more health conscious Groot, Baymax, your personal health care companion, is the film's highlight. He and Hiro provide both a surprising amount of emotional depth and superb action sequences which most definitely reflect the story's connection with Marvel. The supreme quality of the animation makes the action and flying scenes through the excellently-designed 'San Fransokyo' city skyline visibly awesome, cueing an unfortunately audible Neo-worthy ""Woah"" from me several times. The soundtrack is also highly recommended.Big Hero 6 isn't without its faults though. By all means don't lose faith if you need to see it with an offspring or younger sibling; it's certainly an enjoyable time. But it is not as re-watchable or fantastic as a Pixar offering or Disney Renaissance film. This is mainly due to the poorly fleshed out characters, with the exception of the two leads - the supporting characters who form the superhero team are decently done but disappear for a while before being re-introduced. Maybe I've become spoiled by Pixar over the last few years and am expecting too much from a kid's film. Probably. But make sure to see it anyway, and treat it like a Marvel film (which really it is) by watching out for the Stan Lee cameo and staying for the post-credits scene.",negative
Big Hero 6,"Please don't listen to the bad reviews and watch this yourself.I registered with IMDb just to write this. That is how much faith I have in this film. I really cannot believe some of these bad reviews.. ""Not a kids film""?? kids would go mental for this.Animation was nothing short of exquisiteComedy was extremely funny (and i'm not one for comedies)Story line was really great tooAlso made me cry a little... mehplease please please watch how awesome this is. i'm nearly 28 and I absolutely loved it.",positive
The Wolverine,"Are you kidding me??? I mean seriously almost everything out of Hollywood lately seems to fall prey to the same qualities as this movie. Completely unbelievable, unrealistic, CGI overload, cheesy, and a horrible plot that absolutely insult's the intelligence of it's audience. If you are on drugs I'm sure you will like it because it's obvious the writers wrote this garbage stoned. This is the first time I have ever written review for any movie on this site which should tell you how tired I am of seeing the same junkie pathetic movies of late. I don't know the gentlemen that reviewed this movie from LA but I can't believe he gave this 10 stars. Must have been paid handsomely.... I wouldn't be surprised if this movie was written by the same writer as the Lone Ranger.......blah",negative
The Wolverine,"I didn't much care for X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Hugh Jackman still was, and always will be, a brilliant Wolverine, but the other characters felt lackluster, the villain was weak and the storyline didn't fit well with the other X-Men movies. It didn't have the same feel.For some time it seemed that the poor critical performances of both that and X-Men 3 would mean there would be no more movies with Wolverine in them, at least in a leading role. Luckily, the film makers decided to do one more and if this particular movie is going to be the last one, I for one can move on happy with what I got.The Wolverine is a movie that works both as a continuation of the X-Men storyline, as well as a standalone movie. The focus is kept heavily on Hugh Jackman, which works for the movie's advantage. There are some callbacks to the events of the trilogy, but as a whole I think this film could have worked just as well without them, if not better, as they are a bit distracting from time to time. But most of the time the focus is on where it should be. In this movie Logan travels to Japan in order to meet an old acquaintance, who wants to settle old scores before his demise. In Japan we get some gorgeous scenery, nice atmosphere, intriguing settings, believable characters, all that good stuff.I especially liked Tao Okamoto's character Mariko, the granddaughter of Wolverine's old friend. Jackman and Okamoto have brilliant chemistry together and when the movie slows down during the second act to give them time to simply interact with one another, it feels justified. Usually that kind of slowing down in an action movie feels boring and unneeded, even sappy, but here it works because the actors have the skills to pull it off. Which is a great thing, because it gives the movie more depth and we get a chance to know Wolverine in a new way that the Origins movie tried to reach, but never could because of its lack of emotional maturity.Unfortunately this film has one major flaw and that is the unbelievably weak villain, known as Viper. Her actress, Svetlana Khodchenkova, just doesn't have the screen presence or acting skills to give the character any memorable attributes. She merely stands there, struts around in her skintight suit and spouts the dialogue. That's it. Sure part of that is poor writing, but it's still rather jarring because the two main protagonists are so damn good. If only the villain had been as good, this could easily have been one of the best Marvel movies yet made.As it is, it's still fine. The two main characters are very good, most of the side characters do a good job as well, the action works wonderfully, the Japanese setting gives the film a nice coating of majesty and even the story, while nothing that extraordinary, functions well enough for us to enjoy it. The villain is weak, very weak in fact, which keeps the film from being great, but you can overlook it and focus on the good stuff.",positive
Hellboy,"Story was rushed, very little character development, and the climax was disappointing. They should have funded a 3rd Guillermo del Toro movie instead. I try and give movies a chance, including this one, but the film was really bad. The only other movie I've ever wanted to leave early for was Dumb and Dumber To.",negative
Hellboy,Just because Del Toro isnt directing and Hellboy isnt Perlman doesnt mean this film should be getting slammed unfairly the way it is. it's a new vision and adaptation that actually works even better as far as following comic source material. The action and pacing is intense and the horror aspects are really well blended. People keep slandering the cgi and honestly its excellent cgi. The story blends many different particular comics together and it works. David Harbor gives a lot of great character to hellboy as well. Just see this and pay no mind to delusional biased critics and haters. It's a fun adaptation.,positive
Predestination,"TL;DR: Acting is very good; plot makes no sense whatsoever, even for a time-travel movie.SPOILERS: . . . The plot of the movie is this: A man travels back in time, to recruit himself from the past, to time-travel further back into the past, to impregnate himself from the even further past (when he was a woman), so that he can steal the resulting freak-baby from himself, which grows up to be himself from the even further further past - growing up as a woman and eventually giving birth to himself by being impregnated by himself.Yes ladies and gentlemen, it is that goddamn stupid.At the beginning of the movie, it sets itself up to be about the protagonist hunting a terrorist, that is called the ""Fizzle Bomber"" - which of course turns out to be himself from the future -, but 90% of the movie is spent setting up the nonsensical mega-incest-story about a man giving birth to himself by impregnating himself.Conclusion: Maybe worth the price of a rental, but definitely not worth buying.",negative
Predestination,"I just watched this movie again for the third time tonight and it blew me away just as it did the first time I watched it. And although it's cliche to say, it's absolutely true with this film that everytime you see it you'll catch something new that was missed previously. The story is brilliant and the acting by Ethan Hawke, Sarah Snook, and Noah Taylor was just top notch - each of them deserved an Oscar nomination (and no that's not hyperbole).To all the negative reviewers, who either 1. Complain they don't understand the plot, 2. Thought the plot was ""ridiculous"", or 3. Claim the ""twist"" was too ""predictable"", let me tell you why you're all embarrassingly wrong.The ""twist"" is not that the Barkeep and Unmarried mother is the same person, that was pretty much revealed in the first 5 minutes of the film when you see the burnt face of Jane in the explosion being surgically repaired to become the healed face of the Bartender. If this was intended to be the ""twist"", the storytellers would not have Jane's face be so obviously shown in that opening scene. This is where most people are wrong. Furthermore there was plenty of dialogue through the movie that slowly but assuredly reveal and reaffirm this plot point. Also the fact that he/she is the fizzle bomber is not surprising, but it was not meant to be surprising. That wasn't the payoff.The ""twist"" was when Jane's surgeon explained to her after the Cesarean that she is a hermaphrodite (which is a REAL medical condition, so no the plot is not ridiculous). That was the climatic moment of the film, the ""OMG"" moment. It was a gut wrenching scene, one that Sarah Snook did an amazing job in, along with the subsequent scene when she was learning to change her voice and realized she could no longer call herself by her name Jane. What a performance. On first viewing of this film, no one, and I mean NO ONE, could've foresaw that coming. That is the twist, the ingredient, that sets this time travel movie apart from all others and actually makes it work. As Robertson explained to the Bartender, he is special, he is nature's anomaly that enables him uniquely suited for time travel. He has ""no ancestry"" or more precisely a circular ancestry. He is his/her own father/mother/child/grandparent. His whole life, every action taken, was predestined. In a sense his existence ensured there would be no time travel ""grandfather"" paradox. No Marty McFly changing his timeline here! And that is why he is so valued by Robertson and the Bureau.While that was the most important twist in the story, there are 3 others: 1. When we see Jane's lover is herself in 1963, 2. When the Bartender traveled back in time to kidnap the baby to complete the temporal loop, and 3. When the temporal field kit suffered a seemingly unfortunate error/ ""malfunction"" and couldn't decommission. For those who are paying close attention, this was not an accident. This was in fact Robertson sending the Bartender on a final (FINAL but illegal) mission which is why Robertson left him the note ""trace the timer"". One could even take it a step further and suggest that Robertson knew all along that John is the Fizzle bomber, but that his ""terrorist"" acts are just the lesser of two evils, consequences that actually prevented even bigger tragedies and overall saving more lives than taken.Again this a tremendous, all-time great sci-fi/time travel movie, that has you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Screenplay, acting, directing, an amazing tour de force. Go see it again and again, I know I will.",positive
What Happened to Monday,"The idea behind this movie is great and could have made for a good movie. But it seems the director went so all out for edge-of-your-seat scenes that he forgot that overdoing drama can ruin a good drama.So to give you just a few examples of silly writing: 1) There is a task force surrounding the building in which the siblings live. They fire smoke grenades into the building from the ground floor. Every single grenade manages to hit its target - smashing through small windows into the apartment. Not a single miss.2) the siblings make their way through the building and use the fire escape to make their exit. Of course, the back entrance to a building is always the safe way to leave when you have a determined army looking to make you disappear. I mean, why would the army want to guard a back door? That would be a waste of men! 3) The task force who have planned this intrusion storm the building. The a sibling returns to the apartment and collects some aerosol cans and pops them in the microwave for 60 seconds. Then she breaks a gas line. Meanwhile the task force have gathered outside the apartment door. Way more than 60 seconds elapse as the sibling attends to some last minute photo transfers, then she presses send and as the microwave counts down to zero, this is the exact moment the task force attempt go to make their move, and the moment the sibling finishes her dramatic sentence. The microwave hits zero and the apartment explodes - propelling the task force into the air. (So who knew that aerosol cans take exactly 1 minute in a microwave to detonate!?). And there's enough gas in the building to completely destroy it, yet not a single member of the task force smell gas and think twice about entering the apartment4) in the very next scene, the leader of the task force, who one would have thought took the brunt of the explosion that destroyed the apartment is stood on the ground floor unscathed giving orders to his team.This is just one scene. But there are loads of scenes like this that take the film beyond credulity and, for me anyway, spoilt the movie.Shame",negative
What Happened to Monday,"How often do I get to say ""wow"" when I see a movie? Let me tell you, rarely......What Happened to Monday is really quite brilliant. It takes the serious real world issue of overpopulation and pits it against the intrinsic human imperative to protect its offspring. The inevitable collision that takes place when the need to see the species thrive at the expense of the individual, is the starting point of this film. What happens in between is a cleverly crafted mix of sci fi, masterful storytelling, well executed action with a emotional component that's genuinely touching. Noomi Rapace of ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" fame hands in yet another show stopping performance, nimbly and ably playing multiple characters, seemingly with ease. That's not to dismiss the performance of other cast members. This is a collectively polished affair. This is, for me, a ""must see"" and possibly even ""see again"" sci fi. Ten out of ten from me.",positive
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has technical merits. However, these merits are impossible to enjoy in a film drowned from beginning to end in the sickening narcissism of both its purported hero and supposedly tragic villains.I give you The Amazing Spider-Man: a hero with no principles and no goals. He sometimes cares about a girl and sometimes wants to know what happened to his parents, but day-to-day he really only cares about doing what he wants to do--which happens to be helping people, it seems, because it gives them ""hope."" And what luck! He gives them this just by being himself. Not by being a better person. Not by sacrificing anything else in his life for the greater good. Just by being strong and smart and doing exactly what he feels like doing because that's how he feels. And look: by being himself, other people want to be like him. What a wonderful message for a self-obsessed age. And watching the box office dollars roll in, it would seem that this is just what everyone wants to hear.Ah, but lovable doe-eyed Petey gives up Gwen for the greater good, right? No he doesn't. He gives her up because he can't face the guilt of having contributed to her father's death--his guilt, and his unquestioned inability to give up being a famous public figure, lead to his need to break up (And his principled stand on this issue is so strong that he will renege on it whenever he feels randy). We never see Peter torn between helping people and helping himself. We see him torn between two paths to self-gratification: the adulation of public heroism (and public vilification, which is a kind of adulation) and the love of a single woman. What about Aunt May? No, not her--she's just in the way of Spidey laundry.This is the major problem with the reboot: The overshadowing death isn't Uncle Ben's. It's Captain Stacy's. And Captain Stacy didn't die because Peter was self-absorbed. Captain Stacy died because Peter existed. So the standard for Peter being a good person or bad person has nothing to do with his character--it has only to do with his presence. During an over-the-top car chase in the first act, rather than stop a massive truck from smashing through a set of cars (which Sam Raimi has shown us he could have done, assuming equivalence between a truck and a train), Spidey ducks out of the way only to come back after the carnage. This is a hero who says, ""I'm here for you--until it's inconvenient for me, then you're on your own.""The long and short of it is that this Spider-Man is in no way heroic. Superheroes are heroic because, while they could decide that they are unconcerned with our struggles, they still feel a moral obligation to help the average Joe. This Spider-Man seems to feel obliged to help only because, as someone superior to everyone else, the world's problems must naturally fall on his shoulders. Not because someone died due to his inaction--because he's exceptional. And helping inferior people is what exceptional people do. Sometimes. When they're not busy dealing with exceptional-person stuff. Like obsessing about parents who unjustly abandoned them while feeling no responsibility whatsoever for the uncle they themselves abandoned.Add to this a pair of villains who go from being apparently well-meaning if somewhat imbalanced individuals to homicidal maniacs due to a single rejection episode, and you have a two-hour cesspool of poorly justified destructive self-obsession. Electro could have been a tragic Frankenstein villain. Instead, because a group of random people roots for Spider-Man over him in his first public appearance, he decides everyone should die. Yup--that's his motivation. You don't love me because I'm me? Well, I'll kill you all. Thank you, Columbine.Harry's the same. After a five-minute meeting in which Spider-Man refuses give him his blood--which he truly believes, based on a single night's research on a single computer file, is the only thing that can save him from a horrible death that won't happen for another 40 years--Harry decides that Spider-Man needs to die right now. And everyone who dies in the process of saving his own old-age skin is perfectly okay. This despite Harry having been Peter's best friend only 48 hours before--though not because they have a long history together, but because they talked for a few hours and remembered how they were friends eight years ago. And it's not like either of them developed any other close relationships over their entire time in high school and college. (Let that be the only mention I will make of this film's preposterous set of causes and effects--and its Attack-of-the-Clones-inspired need to intellectually dictate emotional importance rather than meaningfully display it.)The original Spider-Man had a single moment of narcissism. Count 'em: one. Only once did Peter Parker step up for glory, himself, and his own objectives, and he immediately paid for it with the death of one of the only three people he loved. This new Peter Parker steps up for himself every day as a part of his playground vision of a hero, and not a single screenwriter or billion-dollar audience member seems to care. This Spider-Man says the world should glorify you for being you, and if that doesn't happen, it's the world that needs to change, not you. And that is what truly terrifies me.",negative
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"I know there have been so many bad reviews of this movie, but I found it to be a wonderful movie. The thing I love the most about this Spider-Man series is that it isn't afraid to deal with the emotional aspects of the Spider-Man series. Anyway, I will rate each aspect of the movie below.1) Andrew Garfield: I find Mr. Garfield to be a wonderful Spider-Man. He grasps the cockiness and nerdiness that matches the comics well. He was great in this movie, carrying the emotional and action scenes like a pro. 2) Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy: I absolutely love Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone as Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey. Their chemistry is so real (love that they're together in real life), and the scenes between the two of them are my favorite. They are what make this Spider-Man series so special. 3) Villains: I did feel that although the villains in this movie were played well, that there were too many. Jamie Foxx played a good Electro, and Dane DeHann was a creepy Green Goblin. But, I found some of the fights scenes long. Overall, villains were played well. 4) Soundtrack: The soundtrack was OK. I was disappointed that James Horner didn't return to score this one, but Mr. Zimmer did an OK job. Some of it sounded too dub-steppy and I just found it a little too loud. 5) *major spoiler* Gwen's Death: I knew it was coming, but I still cried my eyes out. I cried for a solid 15 minutes. From how aggravatingly close Peter was to saving her, to his hauntingly realistic reaction to her death, it was heartbreaking. I am still in mourning. 6) Other things I loved about this movie: the costumes, some of the sarcastic Peter Parker humor, the adorable Peter-Gwen pictures hanging in Peter's room, and finally getting an explanation as to why Peter's parents died. I was sad that it didn't get better reviews, because I loved it. Spider-Man is my favorite superhero, and even though I thought the ending was heartbreaking, I will definitely come see the next Amazing Spider-Man.",positive
Fantastic Four,"Based on a scientific project that Reed Richards (Miles Teller) has been developing (which can transfer matter from one dimension to another) the Fantastic Four use themselves as Guinea Pigs in order to transfer themselves to another dimension (in the belief that there is something in this other worldly dimension that will benefit their own planet). However, something goes wrong for our foursome during the transportation process and they end up with drastic physical transformations (some which are much more noticeable than others). Worse still, they tried and failed to save Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and leave him behind believing him to be dead. Later on, a team go back to the other dimension and discover that Victor is still alive and bring him back to Earth in order to assess his condition. But Victor has no intention of staying on Earth and is determined to create a new world in this other dimension and will stop at nothing to achieve his objective. Victor has also suffered a physical transformation, but he has become much stronger and more powerful than his former friends and the Fantastic Four find that they must work together to try to stop him from carrying out his evil plans.The film opens up with some promise whereby we're given an insight into how our illustrious foursome ended up becoming the formidable team that we saw in the earlier films. Despite a fairly promising beginning though this reboot completely fails to bring about a lot of the magic that we witnessed in the 2005 version of this film.A big problem for me lay with the tone of the film; firstly it takes itself WAY too seriously and as a result it made the film quite boring to watch. When watching this it felt like I was watching a science documentary (with all its wordy geeky exposition) rather than what should be a fun comic book type movie. This brings me on to my next point 'What fun'? In the 2005 film (and the 2007 film as well) there was much more in the way of camaraderie between the cast making the film much more fun to watch. As a villain Von Doom isn't particularly well-developed here and I felt his motivations for world-domination were a little sketchy here - I criticised Von Doom's motivations in the original film, but compared to his motivations here they now seem more plausible in retrospect.I appreciate that this is a reboot and therefore the filmmaker's are trying to put their own stamp on things (presumably that explains why Johnny Storm is black in this film and also explains why their powers have been attained in a different manner to the original film). The problem with this reboot is that they've failed to do anything to improve on the original film; the story isn't as interesting, the characters are much weaker and are poorly developed, there is no real exploration of their super powers (this was a big thing in the previous films and made sense as they were a big life-changing aspect for the foursome), but here they just kind of have the super powers and then that's it - off to destroy Victor Von Doom. The only real super power that is explored is that of The Thing and even that super power is exploited in a rather lame way.The cast are another big problem with this film as they totally failed to engage with me (as well as each other); Miles Teller is really bland as Reed Richards (even more bland than Ioan Gruffudd was in the original films) which is surprising as he put in a very good performance in Whiplash 2 years ago. Kate Mara is very pretty, but she's terrible in this film (again probably worse than Alba was in the original films). Michael B Jordan tries his best as Johnny Storm, but he lacks the charisma that Evans brought to the role in the original films and as a result suffers badly in comparison. The Thing for me is probably the best character in the film, but he lacks the touching back story that we lay witness to in the original film and again suffers from not being developed sufficiently enough to make me really care about him here.The ending is also poor and lacks any kind of intensity and tension and has the Fantastic Four doing 'the obvious' to wrap the film up.All in all it's a very disappointing film where the serious tone is perhaps a bigger enemy to the film than Doctor Doom. It's big and bloated, but it's also boring, and lacking in both fun and imagination. I'd recommend giving it a wide berth.",negative
Fantastic Four,"I went into this movie with hope and optimism and not put off by the negative light shone towards it. An hour and 40 minutes later, I left feeling empty and unsatisfied. Comic book films are supposed to make you feel inspired, but not this one. So what is wrong with it? One word – chemistry. In any superhero team/ensemble there should be great character interactions and a feeling that these guys can effectively make a team, never mind a ''fantastic'' team. The best team movies all have characters playing off each other as in the Avengers and X-Men.  However, there is zero chemistry between any of the F4. We see an attempt at some early romance between Reed and Sue which doesn't go anywhere. Johnny Storm is billed as a genius but troubled kid however we never see why he has a high IQ, he is just shifted in to make up the numbers. We never see him form any sustainable bond with any of the others. Ben Grimm also appears as an outsider, brought in with little sense to the project to fill the final slot. The chemistry between the original F4 (2005) was MUCH better whereas here they feel like 4 individuals.  The climatic battle takes place in the most boring environment that you can imagine. It is over within 10 minutes, with not much ingenuity to overcome a half decent attempt at Dr Doom, who at first seems very intimidating. This film will be quickly forgotten and the question isn't whether a sequel will be made or whether it will cross over with X-Men, but is the original Fantastic 4 film a better watch than this depressing, dull comic book movie. Final score 5.5/10",positive
Star Trek Into Darkness,"We need Star Trek Into DEEPNESS, not darkness.In the movie theatre I heard a complaint from an old school Trekkie that the second installment of the Star Trek reboot had too many ""Little Archie and Veronica"" moments.This is true and it would be OK if that were just the icing on the cake. The real problem with the movie is that it runs like a typical SciFi action plot inserted under a Star Trek banner.This movie is missing the hallmark epiphany moments Star Trek is famous for. Mainly, it is missing the philosophical ""WOW"" factors that don't just blow your mind but rather expands it, making you realise that everything you thought you knew is wrong and that everything you thought the Federation had figured out is also wrong. These expansions used to pave the way for the audience to mentally and emotionally take that next step to, ""Boldly go where no man has gone before..."" This movie has no epiphany. Where is the deepness that Star Trek is synonymous with? This movie gives us what? A federation struggling with internal corruption and terrorism, a la the typical disgruntled ex employee, who in this case was cryogenics frozen for 300 years, as is the plot. Big deal. These are familiar themes we've all seen in movies before. Just trade the Federation for any corrupt financial, medical, educational, government and or religious institution. Trade the ""John Harrison"" character for any Bond villain and you have a movie that sounds like a bunch of other movies or what the news broadcasts. Boring.To me the Federation meant a time in the future when Humanity had finally gotten its act together and to a certain extent had rooted out all this corruption and terrorism. Unless a Klingon or Romulan shows up, things are supposed to be refreshingly illuminating. Not something that degrades into ordinary, mainstream, average caveman fist fight showdowns. How can we boldly go where no man has gone before in the future unless we have thrown off the shackles of the past? What a sad/shamey day it is when a Star Trek movie presents a not so optimistic future just as dark as today's headlines. I can read/watch the news/The Matrix if I want that. IS THERE NO ESCAPE?!!! IS THERE NO HOPE?!!! Obviously, Gene Roddenberry's spirit could not find a way to keep the franchise on track. Will, (Vulcan fingers crossed) Trekkies and non-Trekkies alike know the difference between the wealth of deepness and the poverty of darkness?",negative
Star Trek Into Darkness,"No lie, this was one of the worst movies I've seen in awhile. Thin, dull plot that's already a rehash from a prior film. Paper thin characters. Zero intellectual or emotional depth. There was nothing challenging about this story, nothing thought provoking or even intriguing. Basically, bad guy wants to blow some *beep* up and after a bunch of explosions and hand-to-hand fights and crappy one liners, he's stopped by our heroes. The end. This kind of formula occasionally produces an awesome movie or two, but those movies are usually fresh and intelligently made in some way that makes them stand out. This movie was not intelligently made, not at all. Seriously, the writing here seemed like a seventh-grader's rendition of how adults are supposed to act: the Uhura / Spock 'fight' was like a scene you'd overhear in a middle school hallway or something. It was laughable. The few moments that should have been stirring sucked because they were just straight rips from Wrath of Khan. On screen, it seemed like explosions, gunfire, and lens flare dominated probably 80% of the shots, and the effects looked like something from a B-grade Xbox game. There was so much CG ""action"" that it all ended up being pretty boring. I never felt any sense of danger. Worst of all was that constantly swelling score with the same series of notes over and over and over again. You know what I'm talking about. I mean, damn, it was cool the first couple of times, but when the 18th minor protagonist triumph was accompanied by this same bombastic progression, I was curled up in a fetal position. Please, just make it stop. Beyond all of these issues, Star Trek was never supposed to be about endless violence and effects and one liners. It seems like Abrams has turned the series into a moderately more upscale version of Transformers, and it's too bad. There was so much more that could have been done. So yeah, this movie sucked. A lot. I can't believe the rating it has on here. I'm starting to wonder if most of the voters work for the studios or if they've received lobotomies or something...",positive
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,"It is as if the concern of the producers and story writers were so focused on the movie's DBOX worthiness that they forgot to include the story line.I went to this movie with two friends that have not read the books, as I have. Both walked out of the movie confused...""Where did the virus come from?"" was the first question that they asked. The beginning of the movie should have included the reason why W.I.C.K.E.D. created the Maze, explained what the Flare is, and introduced both groups of Maze runners. Instead, the audience is lost in visual effects without knowing why the action is happening. To add insult to injury, the writers turn the virus infected people into inhuman, biologically altered zombies. The immune are now a commodity for a short term fix to the virus problem. So much has been lost by these adaptations that the result is a vague and confusing zombie flick. I almost walked out.This was a wonderful book that should have been an incredible movie.",negative
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,"To begin with, I have to let you know that I was not aware of the existence of any book before I saw the first and second movie. So, comments like ""you ruined the book"", etc. don't make sense to me. I saw the first movie on a DVD and this one in the movie theater. For me it was pure entertainment for the entire duration of the movie! I liked the thrilling scenes and the chase from the zombie like people. At some points I could not help but thinking that it a PS4 game and at some point they would turn over the control of the actors to me and I would be left alone clicking on X or L1/R1 to run as fast as I can! I liked that but many may not like it. For me this was awesome!The acting was OK, as expected and really similar to the first one. It's not like you wait to see an Oscar-winning performance there, right? I really enjoyed all the special effects and the amazing scenes from the cities that are crumbling and falling apart. The movie seemed a lot longer than it is. The action-packed and full story behind it, gave too much information and left me feeling really ""full"" after watching it and this was not because of the XXL pop corn that I ate! I will go to the movies to see the third one, with excitement! And yes, it definitely is an ""8"" in its genre. ""7"" felt like a minimum, so I would easily give a ""7.5"" with pleasure! If you don't like this kind of post-apocaliptic stories, wait till it's out in DVD, don't spend money in the movies. If you do like them, go and see it, like yesterday!",positive
The Dark Tower,"Imagine someone told all of Game of Thrones in one movie that was just an hour and a half, then cut out 99% of the story. :(",negative
The Dark Tower,"I've been reading these books for over two decades now. I was really pumped about the movie. I saw the very first showing, and I can say that the negative reviews coming out about this film are unwarranted. First, you have to keep in mind what they were hoping to achieve with this movie given the budget. It's a similar play to that of the first Hunger Games movie. If they get some traction with this one, then the subsequent movies/TV series get twice the money to work with. I personally think that they did a fantastic job with this first effort. The acting was solid. The story was actually pretty good. It had some great actions sequences, and the CGI was surprisingly good (most of the time). It was also a very efficient use of time. Every scene helped explain the Dark Tower lore to new audiences. It was a fun action flick that doesn't try to repeat the experience of reading the books. I'll always have the novels. I wasn't expecting this movie to recreate that experience for me.Plus, as a die hard fan from way back, it was just great to see Roland and Jake on screen for the first time. It just felt right. Give it a try with an open mind.",positive
Assassin's Creed,As many others I played the Assassins Creed games and was looking forward to this film however it is safe to say that I was extremely disappointed. No matter if you have played the games or not this film was awful. First things first the script is poor. If I hadn't played the games I would have struggled to understand many of the references. The script is vague and confusing in parts which led to a man who sat in front of me leaving half way through (I wish I did the same). Although I am a fan of Michael Fassbender the quality of the writing meant he was wasted in this film. When it comes to the special effects the use of CGI was average. The fighting sequences weren't as good as I expected as it wasn't clear what was happening. The overall story was disappointing and the fact that there will be a sequel made it even more disappointing. I hate to compare but the games were good and the film was rubbish. I would not advise wasting time watching this. Please. For your sake.,negative
Assassin's Creed,"I'm going to come out and say it, the critics are right, but there is a big but here. If you have played this game, you are going to truly enjoy it. The big problem that I think is not going to brake the video game curse is the fact that it isn't possible to cover the whole story in such a short amount of time and appeal to critics and people who haven't played the game and never will while satisfying gamers in a way that won't scare them away from the video game itself. So if I'm talking right now to a gamer, I would say that this movie has it all, but if I'm not, you will probably dislike the movie or simply just enjoy it as a C grade movie that got you entertained for two hours and you'll forget about it in a few more. Now that's out of the way here is my fan review. The parkour, the animus, the outfits, the scenes and the story was all an amazing representation of Assassin's Creed. It made justice to the game completely. If you are a fan of the games, you'll truly enjoy this film to its fullest potential. Lastly, Fassbender's performance was amazing and the assassin girl was crazy good. ""Nothing it's true, everything is permitted."" Cons: one eagle flying scene could have been enough and the last shot was cheesy, but other than that I loved this film for the same reason I love the videogames.",positive
Tomorrowland,"Veiled in sparse, mysterious promotion, TOMORROWLAND is, well, kind of based on the section of Disneyland providing a retro-reversed future, viewed through the awe-inspired eyes of the 1950's when true Science Fiction reigned and dreams were storybook creative and Utopian deluxe.Starting out as a ROCKETEER meets CONTACT, we have two young heroes – first a brilliant boy who will grow into George Clooney; and then a determined girl who receives a magical pin to enter the titular location that includes a monorail (sans the rail) and other futuristic CG visuals, as if George Lucas created a live-action JETSONS... But Steven Spielberg seems the nostalgic influence of director Brad Bird. Unfortunately, as we're detoured into a clunky road picture involving intrepid kids and banal villains, it's more of a limp GOONIES than a Millennial CLOSE ENCOUNTERS.The lead character, Casey Newton, has a ""special"" gift, especially heightened when she receives that device, allowing her to glimpse into a strange new world, introducing that splendid location teased upon before detouring back on our ""filthy"" present time. The action sequences are shot well enough, but there's never a legitimate reason to go from one point to the next. And as Brit Robertson overacts through this big budget blockbuster, she'd be perfect for a Nickelodeon TV movie or sit-com...Not that our A-list George Clooney is that much better. Grumpy and lethargic, when his eccentric former boy genius Frank Walker engages in physical activities, it's as awkward as the non-chemistry with his young partner – think Doc Brown and Marty McFly, on Valium. And from the very onset, there's another young girl whose purpose shouldn't be spoiled She winds up taking away from what Robertson should have had: a genuine connection with Clooney. Instead, the trio, together during a supposedly pivotal arc, seem like they're rehearsing for three different movies at the same time and badly.Calling TOMORROWLAND preachy, as some mainstream critics have had to reluctantly admit, is an understatement – and an insult to films with a more subtle/less overwhelming message intact: not uncommon in the Sci-Fi genre, especially going back to the Atomic Era 50's. Yet the final doomsday monologue by Hugh Laurie, while reminiscence of Michael Rennie's anti-nuke lecture at the peak of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, is more annoyingly hypocritical (coming from Disney) than overall effective.Too silly to be deep and too complicated to be involving, TOMMOROWLAND doesn't feel especially catered to any particular age group. Basically, director Brad Bird and co-scriptwriter Damon Lindelof have taken us for a long misleading ride. And the irony is... they meant to.",negative
Tomorrowland,"I very rarely write reviews for movies, but after watching Tomorrowland I've never seen a movie that's been so unfairly maligned by negative reviews,especially considering that this movie was an absolute joy from beginning to end. After watching it, and reading truly horrible, reviews I'm starting to think that somebody hired a few live bodies to slate this movie for their own specific reasons. The script, actors and directors captured the feeling of endless possibilities perfectly. The FX were fantastic, there were no lulls in the plot, George Clooney did his thing perfectly, the child actors were incredible, and there were just enough twists and turns to maintain the pace.Please, please watch this movie and make your own mind up - the negative reviews almost put me off, but I'm so glad I actually took the chance. Actually there's one proviso here - and is probably something consistent with most of the negative reviews: If you lack imagination, or the yearning for a better world, then you'll hate this movie. Or you want to raise kids who aspire to be nothing more than reality TV actors. Or if you're a reality TV actor. Or your kids can't read or write because you don't think it's important. Or if you think science is dumb. Or if you can't embrace hope.As for me...I loved it. I'll be watching it again and again :-)One of the best movies of 2015, and now on my ""favourite movie"" list.",positive
Terminator Genisys,"The Terminator franchise started with a low-budget thriller film that introduced a very interesting and compelling story about a woman who is a target of a ruthless man from the future that turns up to be a cyborg. It was a simple yet good story and a good piece of science fiction. Why was it a good film? Well, for starters, the bad guy, i.e the terminator, according to Kyle Reese, doesn't feel pain or pity, can't be reasoned with, can't be bargained with. It was the perfect killer, and almost invincible. So there you got all the elements of a good story.Then came Terminator 2: Judgement day. Here things start to get weird with the new T-1000, because it was the result of CGI of that time. The whys and hows of the T-1000 were cleverly hidden away and never discussed. The story was good: here Sarah Connor wants to change history and the new terminator ends up showing a window of opportunity.T3 came along and stuff started to crumble. T3 makes no sense. A seemingly old terminator that goes back because a ""more advanced"" (and absurd) terminator came to yet again kill John Connor. They used preposterous ideas justified by the fact that it is a ""fiction"" film (i.e the stuff about controlling automobiles with a ""virus"": cars don't work like that). Well, even fiction must be based on some rules, and T3 simply disregards these rules, and that is what makes it so bad.Salvation came and it was good. Honestly, I don't see why people freak out about Salvation, because it was consistent, it makes actual sense. It looks like a war zone between our present and that future we see in the first films. There are no crazy liquid-metal things this time, only ""normal"" cyborgs and there were very nice references to the first two films. I have no idea why people hate it. It is not a thriller, but action, but then T3 isn't a thriller either, nor is T2, so that is a very bad reason to hate TS.And now came Genisys, with the typo in the name.The film starts with a disturbing change: the judgment day occurred, apparently, in 1997. It means that the whole second film was thrown in the rubbish bin. Sarah's efforts were pointless, apparently Skynet wasn't destroyed after all. But maybe I was confused, so I'll just ignore this and move on.The film introduces an interesting idea: since the future already changed before, Skynet was aware of John's plan to send Kyle Reese and attacks him (John) before he tears the time machine apart, altering the whole story.But this leads to a series of confusing events that end up having a terminator sent to kill Sarah when she was 9 and another to protect her. Then the ""good"" terminator ends up ""raising"" Sarah to have the face of Emilia Clarke instead of Linda Hamilton and both prepare for the arrival of a disturbingly different Kyle Reese in 1984.Then appears the original terminator, apparently unaware it was not the first assigned to kill Sarah, and a T-1000 was apparently sent to kill Kyle (it is never explained who was the target).Then instead of waiting for the right time, Emilia Clarke decides to build a time machine and go to 1997 stop Skynet. But Kyle, as explained by some pseudo-science theory, has memories of an alternate childhood (go figure), and knows Skynet goes berserk in 2017. So they go to 2017 and find out that there is this software which is a mixture of Apple, Google and Facebook called Genisys that for no reason is being used on mobiles, hospitals, and even the army and is going to be ""available"" at precisely the time of judgment day, even though it is already being used.John Connor shows up in 2017 looking like Jason Clarke, and we assume he was cast because he shares the same surname with Emilia, and he is a cyborg because Skynet itself was contained inside a cyborg and it managed to replace every cell in John Connor for nano-technology. He wants to turn his parents into machines and he inexplicably not only defends Skynet, but he created Genisys himself.So John Connor is the bad guy! And he is a terminator who created Skynet! Schwarzenegger tries to kill him, but Sarah points a gun to his... head, and.. it makes no sense.They then invade this company that developed Genisys and end up stumbling on the same computer interface used in Resident Evil: Skynet for some reason has several projectors in the place with the hologram of a child that tries to convince the heroes that they are doomed and you wonder why Skynet wastes time talking to them if it really thinks that, but the holograms make funny noises when they cross the light and you give up trying to understand.In the end Schwarzenegger kills Jason Clarke by getting into this unfinished time-machine with a giant magnet, while Kyle and Sarah explode the building, but in the last second Schwarzenegger falls into the metal goo that would be the T-1000s and even though a T-1000 cannot emulate complex machinery because it has moving parts and all that (check T2), he inexplicably blends just fine with the goo and becomes ""updated"". Oh, that trick is used before too. So even though stuff exploded, the terminator ""survives"".So the film ends leaving a feeling of ""what the hell I just saw"", and I wonder why people find this any better than T3 and why Terminator Salvation is considered worse. It is beyond me. Really people, something is wrong here.So if you like Terminator, go see it. If you liked Salvation, I'm so sorry, but it didn't turn into a trilogy and they just ""terminated"" a good project.",negative
Terminator Genisys,"I am a massive Terminator 1 and 2 fan, I disliked 3 and 4 a lot and I really thought this would be terrible as well! However I turned out to be wrong! Dead Wrong! This film has the best Arnold character of them all! He is the most 'human' towards Sarah and I really loved that connection, I can see many people liking it also. It was reminiscent of John Connor and Arnold from T2 which I just saw today... I remember seeing the first trailer and having many problems. I thought the story line was too complicated and wasn't respectful of the older films and I thought the visuals were bad. I was wrong in both cases. The story pays massive respect to James Camerons first two classics! And it wasn't complicated for me. It was a fun story and kept my eyes on the screen. Also the visuals... wow the visuals... I know people said that we will never be shocked again by visuals like we were in T2 and the first Jurassic Park! But the young T800 looks too good to ignore. Wow! The best animation I've ever seen, I can't see the difference between him and the real one. This is a fun, humorous, emotional action flick that shouldn't be ignored! I loved it! And you know what, I'm not ashamed! Alan Taylor deserves praise! P.S. I love the soundtrack, I hand it to Lorne Balfe who I know makes great soundtracks from Assassins creed!",positive
Artemis Fowl,"Truly an awful film. Scraps literally all the charm and myth of the book and misses every mark that would be necessary for even a decent film. The tone is confused, the scene direction is 10/10 for cringe. All those years of Shakespearean study and practice was a waste of time Kennith? Clearly.
Packed with all the muddled and addled virtue signalling nonsense that you could ever need. It not only defuses any sincerity about the characters but also manages to destroy any possible tension. We seem to be in a place in film making where it is taboo and forbidden for anyone to represent negative qualities of any kind. Everyone is good and nice to each other except for characters hidden in cloaks or the colonial British man.Josh Gads narration is not only entirely unnecessary but delivered like a high school students first assessment project.Holly is wrecked. Root is wrecked. Foaley is nothing. Mulch is intolerable. Butler is wrecked. Juliet is nothing.0 tension. 0 nuance. 0 technique.It may be the worst adaption of a book I've ever seen. Definitely at least in the top 5.",negative

10 Cloverfield Lane,"Why is this movie so critically acclaimed? It's your typical horror/thriller. Except this time they're stuck in a bunker with a nutcase who shoots a guy then gets blown up.Aliens don't show up until the end and Mary Sue, that's what she is not her name, blows their ship up with a molotov cocktail.Overrated trash, just like the original Cloverfield. People love it based on name and the insane amounts of viral adverting the series loves to exploit.If this movie had been called anything else, it would not only been a flop, but the same people praising it would be the most critical.",negative
10 Cloverfield Lane,"It isn't very often that you can go see a movie at the theater and not have the slightest idea of where it'll take you. Even more rare is when a movie like that delivers a wholly original story that's even more satisfying than you ever thought it would be.'10 Clover-field Lane' is a perfect reminder that films can still surprise us, delight us, and horrify us in a way that's never been done before. Mark my words, Dan Trachtenberg will be a force to be reckoned with in the future. His feature length directorial debut is a showcase for his absolute confidence and strength as a storyteller and filmmaker, and I can't wait to see what he does next.Of course, it always helps to have the likes of J. J. Abrams and Bad Robot standing behind you, and their experience and talent absolutely boosts this film into the stratosphere.As far as acting is concerned, Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives her best performance yet, and shows us a strong lead character who's completely believable in a situation that plays out like a horrible nightmare. Speaking of bad dreams, John Goodman turns in a performance unlike anything he's ever done before, and manages to be both strangely sweet and unbearably creepy. And John Gallagher, Jr. nails his roll perfectly and adds some much needed levity to a story that's almost overwhelmingly claustrophobic.I've been thinking about what film I could use to compare '10 Clover-field Lane' to, and while I think even a comparison to a specific film might give too much away, I feel safe in saying that it is absolutely Hitchcock. It's a brilliant, brilliant movie that's told in the best possible way: by showing, not telling.Go and see it as soon as you can.",positive

I will do my best to replace its lack of marketing with recommeding it to everyone. I was expecting something entertaining and instead got an amazing plot with a mind-blowing ending. If you enjoy this genre, you can't let this one pass you by. What everyone says is true, it's like a long, perfectly executed Black Mirror episode. I rated it 10 stars for the simple reason that I could not fine anything wrong with it or anything I didn't like. From beginning to end, this movie is amazing. I cannot recommend it enough.",positive
Star Trek Beyond,"A vapid, dull and disappointing sequelThis is one of the worst sequels I have seen, with none of the science fiction or charm of Star Trek. Even avoiding comparisons to the original it is a pretty dire film.
I am not sure what this is 'beyond' but it lacked any genuineness and from the first minute you could pretty much tell how the film would pan out. The characters were boring and affected , and it was hard to sympathise with these posers given how uninspiringly clichéd they were. One of the great strengths of the series was the way the characters and situations were just of real life. Instead this film only managed unbelievable. A tendency towards almost fairy book style good vs. evil was especially annoying at the beginning of the film.",negative
Star Trek Beyond,"With JJ Abrams helming the first two movies in this series, the focus was clearly on characters and ideas (the things that Mr. Abrams does best). With Justin Lin assuming the director's chair this go-round, one could expect that the tone of this third installment would be quite a bit different. It most certainly is, and how much that bothers/excites you will determine where this one ranks on your overall enjoyment list.For a basic plot summary, ""Beyond"" sees the Enterprise and its crew sent on a diplomatic mission (of sorts) to resolve a feud. Upon arriving on the scene, the Enterprise is completely overwhelmed by a type of weapon they have never seen before. With the crew scattered to the winds (after abandoning ship), they must find each other if they have any hope of fighting back against this new enemy.First and foremost, ""Beyond"" is a high-octane action movie. Like I said, one couldn't expect anything different with Lin behind the camera. Indeed, the action sequences are thrilling, he uses the film's music as a perfect compliment, and the visuals are intense. Whereas the previous two films featured much more dialogue and contemplation, ""Beyond"" charges forward more often than not.Here's the thing, though: In order for Star Trek (of any incarnation) to really, really work, it must either A. Tell a really interesting story; or B. Focus almost exclusively on the characters and hope for incredible acting. ""Beyond"" misses the mark on both those accounts.There are snippets of interesting story/concepts in the movie, but they are not focused upon in favor of standard plot machinations and all those action scenes. The rigors of years in space, the concept of the Federation, and the bond between the crew members are all concepts that could have headlined the film, but instead they are kind of just thrown in at times to try to give the proceedings some gravitas. The old ""need to have some down time before the next action scene"" type of directing.In terms of acting, the individual performances are still great, but I found it an odd choice to have the main cast so split up for most of the film. So much is made in ""Beyond"" about teamwork and the closeness of the crew, yet there are precious few scenes where they actually all get to interact with each other.Now, if you are the type of movie-goer who enjoys an action-adventure romp above all else, ""Beyond"" will be much more to your liking. Personally, that isn't my favorite type of movie experience, so I really wish that it would have done a better job at picking a main plot focus and sticking too it. That isn't Lin's forte, however, so I can't say I'm all that surprised by how this one turned out.A final thought on ""Beyond"" is that I know it was rushed a bit to get into theaters corresponding with Star Trek's 50th anniversary. I wonder if perhaps that could explain why the writing felt a bit stunted and uninspiring. The bottom line, however, is that it really doesn't have that ""Bad Robot feel"" to it like other films that have come from the now-famous production company. It likely will do well enough to not kill off this line of films entirely, but the fourth adventure will have some significant proving to do that it can get back to great storytelling along with the action.",positive
Spies in Disguise,"There is evil in our world. That's a basic, yet sad, fact of life. This movie attempts to circumvent that truth by claiming that, ""there are no good or bad guys, only people."" That, in itself, makes this movie a bit more derisive than it should be. Oh, yes, Will Smith is fantastic as Lance Sterling, and Tom Holland portrays the awkward nerd Walter in a terrific manner. It reminded me a whole lot of his role as Spider-Man in Far From Home.There are a lot of hilarious moments in this film. For instance, the entire scene in Mexico where Lance, as a pigeon, meets up with other pigeons who then attempt to initiate him into their group is a complete and utter riot. It's uproarious, to say the least. I also enjoyed how they did not create voices for the other birds, but rather, created characters that could be portrayed with subtle movements and simple cooing. You can tell that one of them is insane, one is dumber than a box of rocks, and the third is supposed to be some kind of attractive female pigeon.The movie also touches on a lot of spying tropes and turns them inside out in order to create an atmosphere where a pigeon could engage in espionage. It also takes the time to focus on the bird's weak points and how that would be a hindrance to the task at hand. For instance, when Lance tries to take down a Japanese arms dealer, he fails miserably because his wings aren't as strong as his arms and hands used to be. It's an intensely clever premise, and the movie delivers a lot of action among the comedy.The problem, again, is the message, which is horrendously stupid. The idea that just speaking with an internationally known thief and battling him with cute images of puppy dogs and kitty cats is asinine on the greatest of levels. While I appreciate the movie's efforts to advocate for humans to tone down the violence and be nicer to each other, there are times when you have to, as the movie itself puts it, ""fight fire with fire.""So, overall, this was a very well written, well animated feature. Blue Sky never scrimps on animation, and it definitely shows here. The overarching problem with the movie is its ridiculous message that there are no evil people in the world, just misunderstood individuals.",negative

Transformers: The Last Knight,"""Transformers: The Last Knight,"" the dreaded fifth movie in the  Transformers series is supposedly the last to be directed by Michael  Bay and the last to star Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg plays his character  Cade from the previous one. The ""attempt"" at a plot for this movie goes  something like this: Cade comes into possession of an ancient  Transformers artifact called the Talisman and he is the ""chosen one"" to  carry out a ""quest"" for the transformers, while this chick named Vivian  has to acquire Merlin's ""staff"" because for some reason she is the  ""only one who can wield it"" and Optimus Prime heads to Cybertron to  find out ""where he and the transformers came from and what they're  doing on earth."" THAT'S this movie's plot. Lol this movie thinks it has  a plot.   This movie is completely incapable of telling a cohesive story. There  is no beginning, middle, or end. It throws plot threads at you and  expects you to roll with them. The most illogical plot devices occur in  this movie. NOTHING makes any sense. It is so convoluted that the movie  thinks the audience are idiots. How many times was I reminded of what  the plot was throughout the entirety of this atrocity? I counted at  least 32. Nothing of importance happens. Nothing is interesting,  nothing is entertaining.   The characters are so thinly written and poorly developed I didn't care  who lived and who died. At this point in the series, I DON'T CARE ABOUT  THE DAMN HUMANS! Just give us a movie about Transformers, not about  humans. None of them are likable AT ALL. Everything involving the  military, the government, Anthony Hopkins, it's all pointless! The  movie spends so much time and energy on all the stuff everyone  complains about with these movies that none of it comes across as not  appealing, but rather annoying. It's an insult to our intelligence.   The action scenes are the same lazy action scenes the other four  Transformers movies feature. It's stuff that appeals only to teenagers  who do not know how a movie is crafted. Teenagers like action and  explosions and no talking, story, characters, or emotion. This movie  appeals to those teenagers. There I said it again. Watching stuff just  blow up and blow up and blow up and blow up and blow up and blow up  continuously for two and half hours is extremely boring, especially  since it's the only thing that has happened for five Transformers  movies in a row. There is no entertainment value to be had just  watching stuff blow up for a bloated and overlong runtime.  And yes, the runtime is too long, YET AGAIN. Luckily, it is shorter  than the fourth one which was a very drab and dreary two hours and  forty-five minutes. This is about fifteen minutes shorter, but it  easily could have been an hour shorter. Nothing content wise justifies  the runtime of this monstrosity. It's still overstuffed, overlong,  dreary, boring, and exhausting, just like the previous three. I'll give  the first one a pass since I actually enjoy the first one.   This has all the Bay-isms in it. The typical stereotypes, the typical  humor, and the typical dialogue, all of which is stupid, offensive, and  insulting. S many characters are made fun of in this movie for being  different or having different accents you thoroughly understand why  NOBDOY LIKES MICHAEL BAY. He is racist, sexist, and doesn't care about  the audience. He cares only about himself and no one else. It shows.  The two girls in this movie, in typical Michael Bay fashion, are all  hotted out. The young girl is like 14. In what world is this right? Her  tits just hang out the entire movie. The other chick just looks like a  porn star. That's what this series has come down to folks, strippers  and porn stars!  Optimus Prime is literally in the movie for ten minutes to just say his  name three times so that we don't forget about him and who he is and  completely forget that this movie gives him the most sudden shift in  character motivation I have ever seen, more sudden than Batman in  Batman V Superman. If you came to see him wreck house, he is a total  waste in this movie. Quite frankly, none of the Transformers really don  anything in this movie. They all just kind of hang out and chill and  insult each other with stereotypes.  This is one of the worst of the year. I felt like I lost IQ points  watching this movie. It is a loud, dumb, idiotic, incoherent, chaotic,  soulless mess that appeals only to teenagers who like nothing but  action and explosions and die hard fans of the series. It is worse than  Age of Extinction.   I'm just gonna give ""Transformers: The Last Knight"" an F-. Yes that is  now officially a grade.",negative
Transformers: The Last Knight,"We've got to the point where no one expects anything good from any of these Transformer movies, and this one is no different. It has a confusing, pointless plot with heaps of holes, shocking acting, and unlikable characters. However, I didn't watch this movie with the intention of being a critic; I watched this movie one afternoon when I felt like watching a crappy action movie with robots, explosions, and the occasional fart joke. And in that sense, the movie nails it. I had no idea what was going on the whole way through but I'd be damned if I didn't love every minute of it. Mark Wahlberg's acting is disappointingly terrible and that's awesome, and the editing is absolute chaos. It was perfect.",positive
High Life,"I just had a quick look at IMDB before seeing this movie and saw it got 6/10. Looking at reviews now I wonder where that 6 comes from as 90% of reviews here seem to give it 1 or 2...I was close to walking out of this movie a few times, it's that bad. I've been to film festivals, I've seen a lot of great movies but also a lot of awful ones. This is one of the worst I've seen.
I'm struggling to find anything positive. The actors tried to make the best of it but are fighting a hopeless script in an awful set.It's supposed to be science fiction. You can debate the fiction but there's definitely not a shred of science in sight. The lousy excuse of constant acceleration to explain the gravity on the ship, only to announce that the ship has started to slow down without any loss of that artificial gravity. The space suits have helmets that are open at the back. After Monte has been to the ship with the dogs he claims he needs to decontaminate. Next we don't see him cleaning his suit but taking a shower in his vegetable plot.
The ship runs on some magic energy source. Nevermind the energy needed for life support, apparently the engines need to constantly accelerate the box of a ship.Dibs is a scientist and prison warden. The prisoners are also crew members that have to work together. For some reason during the 'day' they can walk around freely and work with tools and potential weapons, but during the 'night' they need to be locked up. Some are tied to their bed with cable ties for some unexplained reason while others are not.
Somehow after 20 years in space the ship meets up with a similar ship that turns out to be full of dogs. No explanation of how the dogs survived by themselves for all that time, or why that ship apparently doesn't need the daily reports to keep the systems alive.I have no problem with nudity but the long scene where Dibs masturbates on a big metal dildo is awful and serves no purpose other than showing Juliette Binoche naked.The most disturbing part of the film are the rape scenes. First a male prisoner/ crew member with tattoos rapes a female prisoner/ crew member and is punished severely. Next the female 'scientist' puts drugs in the ships drinking water (that apparently she doesn't drink herself) and while everyone is unconscious she rapes a male crew member. Apparently that's all fine because she loves him and it's in the name of science. She then goes to the female quarters and rapes one of the women to insert the sperm she just collected.Suddenly we jump 15 years ahead. The baby is now a teenage girl. Just to show she's now a grown woman (and I guess as part of the reproduction theme) we have to see the blood stains on the sheets from having her period. Then father and daughter 'have a good feeling' about the next black hole they've found, get in their escape pod, and....
finally the movie is over. Two hours I'll never get back.",negative
High Life,"I always read the one star reviews first. This movie has attracted some of the best samples. Quite a polarizing one ! Indeed if one is looking for a typical space flick, frustration must loom early on the horizon. High Life requires you to switch to brain waves that are hardly ever solicited in Hollywood. Some will find it boring and slow. For those who want, get ready for a mesmerizing and unsettling trip in your own deep space. It is an experience you will remember long after the end.High Life does not make you feel good, it is a reminder of who we are at both macro and micro levels : we won't ever escape from our planet, nor from our inner selves. We are all prisoners. Birth is the entrance, death is the exit, our best hope is poetry.",positive
Passengers,"OK, the whole movie is hanging on the idea that in future spaceship engineers and designers are complete morons.First of all, the shape of the spaceship. Come on. Secondly, no one ever will send 5000 people on a 120 year journey without the crew rotating in and out of hibernation precisely for the purpose of managing the emergencies. That would be insane on many levels, yet this is the premise of the movie.Thirdly, in Space everything has a backup, or you die. It's fricking Space. But in our case if your hibernation pod malfunctions you can't go back into hibernation. Because pods are ""fail-proof"". ""Cant' break"". It would've been my first question at the presentation, ""Um, sorry, but if my pod craps out, is there a way to put me back into sleep? And will there be anyone on duty to do it? What? No and no? Really? OK, thank you, good bye.""On a psychological level ""Passengers"" makes even less sense. If someone literally ruins your life and all your hopes, you don't forgive him and live happily ever after with him. Doesn't happen. Could've been a cool stalker/survival horror movie, but no, screenwriters aren't smart enough to pull something like that off.One more thing - if you're directly at the exhaust hatch of a huge thermonuclear reactor when that hatch opens - you die. Movie ends right there. Unless screenwriters are idiots. Then you live.Also if you pass that close to a star its gravity sucks you in. And if it doesn't, then you spaceship is built using a whole new set of physics laws, and then why does it take you 120 years to get from point A to point B in the first place?This movie is by stupid people for stupid people. Tons of missed opportunities. Good leads. But stupid people, stupid people everywhere.",negative
Passengers,"I'm almost convinced film critics are paid off...I thoroughly enjoyed this movie more than most of the ""critically acclaimed"" films I've watched this year. This movie had everything- love, drama, philosophical/existential questions, and incredibly suspenseful moments (and not just action scenes!!). The acting was great, pacing was good (never was bored), and the visuals were amazing as well. Also the trailer didn't spoil the movie at all, which was nice. My only gripe would be about the ending, which was still fine.Overall would really recommend watching over the holidays. Really enjoyed it.",positive
Incredibles 2,"It's just full of propaganda, I enjoyed it overall but almost every 10 minutes there was something new trying to brainwash me which I appreciated very little.The ambassador or whatever it was is a woman, that's fine. They added what seems to be some sexually ambiguous folk in there as well, which is also fine. They said Elastigirl is a better superhero than Mr. Incredible, they showed how great of a mother and super hero she is. Then they showed how crap Mr. Incredible is at looking after the house and everything in life to be honest, a complete disaster in fact.At the start they had to make sure Violets boyfriend tells us how he likes powerful women 'cause he's so secure in his masculinity or whatever. Two siblings run a major company, the brains behind the operation of couse, a woman. The parents of the two siblings died, yes, you've got the hang of it now, because the father was an idiot and didn't listen to his wife. The super intelligent villain, is that same woman. These are just some of the things I remember, but one of the scenes that really bothered me was a really short clip of a TV ad where a guy was baking a cake or something and the narrator said ""so simple even HE can do it"", imagine this scene but with a woman trying to fix a computer and the narrator saying it's so simple even SHE can do it, many people would be very upset.I thought the first movie was pretty equal, each member of the family was equally valuable, they all realised they needed each other. While the super intelligent superhero might have been a guy, the super intelligent superhero suit designer Edna is a woman. It all seemed pretty well balanced. I'm just shocked the judge at the end wasn't a black woman as well to be honest.I'm all up for having women with the more significant roles in a movie but this is just an overload to the point where it's blatantly obvious they're trying to brainwash us through a screen, which reminds me a lot of the villain of the movie, peculiar... The message I took away from this is that we're best off just getting rid of men because women are perfect. I guess that's what equality means now a days.",negative
Incredibles 2,"If you don't have Interesting story to tell then just start releasing part 2,3,4 etc.

Maze Runner: The Death Cure,Generic. Filler scenes. No story. Random events unfolding in random order. People looking out through windows. People looking towards the horizon. Somebody cries and then somebody says something heroic but entirely without meaning. People pointing guns at each other without actually intending to pull the trigger. Not a single word of original dialogue. Royalty free filmscore from Youtube. Underwritten love story and underwritten characters. Hollywood executives laughing on their way to the bank.,negative
Maze Runner: The Death Cure,"Honestly i dont know why people are so negative about this movie. i loved the first one. i actually also enjoyed the second one despite the fact that the plot was different from the book. I also found the third movie really good!
It didnt follow the book completly but the main scenes were there. The third book is really good but there are som sci-fi things in it hat i wouldnt want in the movie cause it would simply be too weird. I think Wess did a really good job making the movie more ""realistic"" than the book without ruining the plot. i actually liked some of the scenes from the movie better than the books version. The deaths were more meaningful and emotional than the book made them especially the last death. (you know who). The action was really well made, The actors (espeically Dylan) did a really good job, and the plot was overall good. There was also some good character-developments. i was also more sattisfied with the movieendning than the book. it gave more closure. i definitly recommend watching the first two before watching this one to get a relation to the characters and a better understanding of the plot. Actually. If you have not seen the other movies or at least read the books dont watch this one. You simply wont understand the plot. Dont listen too much to the ratings. If you enjoy the books (and the movies) go watch it and see what YOU think! Some people just dont understand the plot.",positive
World War Z,"Considering what is happening in the world today, this film takes on a different meaning for me, all the more so because both in the book and in the original version of the script the epidemic has its origin in China
not to mention the North Korean thread, which is becoming particularly ominous.",negative
World War Z,"The special effects were impressive, I will give you that. However, the rest wasn't. The 2 hour experience felt like watching titanic sink, in real time. Here is a list of the things that went wrong:1. PG13 rating: The director and producers wanted to make this movie family friendly, so they took away all the gore, death and decay that makes the zombie genre what it is. This made the zombies totally not scary and even on occasions towards the end, just plain laughable.2. Senseless plot: The UN sends a small team to investigate the beginning of the outbreak. They have a neurologist on the team, who incidentally cant stop using cheesy metaphors about mother nature. Why can't they send multiple teams, with more than one expert on each? After all it is clearly a high risk mission, casualties must be expected. After the neurologist dies right after his pretentious speech, it is clear that the whole thing was an excuse to put Brad Pitt in a dangerous situation so that we will feel tension. We still didn't because, see 3.3. Bad character development: None of the characters in the movie had any depth. As a result we didn't care if they lived or died. Pitt's family was just the detestable suburban family, who apparently does nothing but turn money into feces. Their marriage and children felt so plastic and ready-made that I personally would not have felt a thing if Pitt was torn apart by zombies in front of his family. Well, actually that might have improved this movie, alas it couldn't have happened because of 1.4. The ending sequence: Just as we think that the plot cannot get worse and we make peace with the idea of enjoying the special effects, the movie takes another down turn in the last 40 minutes or so. The special effects disappear and we find Pitt and his sidekick in a W.H.O. research facility playing hide and seek with zombies. There is no suspense because the ending is announced basically in the first 5 minutes of this sequence, Pitt will go into the zombie infested part of the building, get some disease samples and bring them back. They will use one of the samples to infect themselves and see if zombies will lose their appetite. They do, and we win, with another pretentious speech about how it is not the end but just the beginning. Yawn.5. Plot holes: a) Zombies can diagnose a terminal illness just by looking at someone and for some reason, they avoid that person. This doesn't make any sense at any level. First, even a doctor with years of medical training can't do that without extensive testing. How can a mindless zombie, who cant figure out how to unbuckle her seat belt, do it just after a glance by the corner of her eye? Second, why the hell would zombies avoid a sick person? There is no reason. After all, the virus, or whatever that is causing the outbreak is not harmed by any other disease. The W.H.O. scientists said so themselves.b) The W.H.O. facility is in Wales, Britain. Among the weapons they have in their arsenal is a baseball bat. Does the director even know where Wales is? Does anyone, one soul in Wales, own a baseball bat? Was that so difficult to make it a cricket bat? Come on now, I think that the director is a bit of a thickie but I can't believe that no one who looked at this movie pre-release had seen Shaun of the Dead. And to add insult to injury, the soldier girl with one hand picks the baseball bat. This scene alone is enough to prove that the director of the movie is blind from birth, because anyone who had at least one functioning eye at any point in his life and used it to glance at a baseball bat would have immediately realized that it is a two-handed weapon. How could a special forces soldier could not recognize it as such and not pick the crowbar?c) The cellphone battery: In one scene, the cellphone's battery is declared dead. In a later scene, it is working again. Really?d) When they decide to recover the disease samples, they give Pitt no briefing about which containers contain what. But apparently, at least one container is full of deadly stuff, which would kill him immediately. Why? Why? OMG, why? The security cameras show the room clearly. All they need to do is to seat Pitt and the soldier girl in front of one of the displays and show them where the goodies are before sending them in.e) Pitt has no special combat, first aid or survival training. He apparently learned all that stuff on the field, and he is not a scientist either. Finally, he doesn't have experience as a commanding officer. So, why would he, instead of literally thousands of military people who were purpose-trained for such a mission, is chosen to lead the mission? It doesn't make any sense. It would have made a lot of sense if his UN friend said something like ""Look, I convinced these people that you are the best man to lead this mission though we both know that you aren't. You are just a guy who spent ten years handing out blankets to African countries. But I had to do it to save your family, alright? They would have never let you on the ship otherwise and you would have died in Philly."" That would have not only sealed this plot hole, but also would have given Pitt's character a tragic and desperate quality, which would have helped us care about him. But the mindless zombies who made this movie missed this chance too.",positive
Men in Black: International,"Sooo I've been watching the MIB movies this month (I saw 1 and 2 sometime but i watched all 3 on the same day). I however never saw this one till today, I was REALLY trying to avoid it but I was curious, Qui Gon Jinn, thor, and frank the pug in one movie? This seems like an amazing fanfic! Boy was I wrong, I don't know why IMDB users once again downvote negative reviews for THIS movie XD. I bet this will get downvoted despite my (what I believe) OBJECTIVE reasons why this movie sucks.First of all, where are the old characters? Agent J and K are literally nowhere to be seen and mentioned. Frank the pug is on the poster but gets like 2 seconds of screen time in this movie which sucks because he was literally one of the reasons why I was interested in watching this since he was probably the best part of MIB II (despite that being flawed as well) and was kinda disappointed that he wasn't in MIB III.Second of all, the new characters honestly SUCK. They get little to no development at all through this film, I wouldn't say thor and that other girl are ""unlikable"" but there is no reason why we should like them or root for them. I had hope for Qui Gon but apparently he just turns into some alien just because the movie wants some plot twist for no actual reason. Remember when the attractive alien got in the base in MIB II? You're telling me you can detect strangers that aren't part of your team but not aliens. Agent H is just well thor without any powers and in a tuxedo and Agent M is probably worse. There's a scene where they even ask why she should be on MIB, she literally says ""because I'm smart and motivated"" yeaaah sure. How did she even know that MIB was still around? Well it's certainly a coincidence because if it wasn't, she would have wasted her whole life being a CIA agent. Agent J was at least a police officer so we know what he has to back up him and MIB II showed that Agent K would have worked for the post office or something. Agent M has NOTHING backing her up. Apparently her pet that she had when she was 20 years younger shows up and she still remembers it? I thought they made sure to wipe your memory and all evidence of you existing, how did she remember this creature?Third of all, the special effects look pretty bad. Not as bad as Origins: Wolverine but you can tell they will look dated. Even the part where she gets dressed up is edited like its some weird rap/music video.If all of this isn't enough to convince how bad this movie is, Thor literally has S*X WITH AN ALIEN! I AM NOT KIDDING. Ugh, it's a better (well more enjoyable) comic book movie than lets say The New Mutants but it still suffers the same problem where they fail at replacing old legacy characters to put these new amazing Hollywood characters that will ""appeal"" to EVERYONE.. ehahaha yeah right",negative

Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"I always thought Captain America was a corny ""golden age of comics"" superhero that had long passed his expiration date. I was shocked by how much I liked him in his first film. I was delighted to grow to like him even more in this one. They set up the character beautifully in the first movie, but he explodes as a hero here. It's hard to fault the character or this movie. Not just the MC, but the whole cast was well written and acted here. The action is well directed and tense. Battles feel much more real than most Marvel battles. There was much less obvious CGI than most films in the franchise, and it pays off. This is one of the best Marvel films to date. Lightning in a bottle. A highlight in the MCU.",negative
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) is the best Marvel comic book Action Superhero movie and one of my favorite films of The Avengers! Big, busy and action-packed - like the first movie, but with better pacing. It is a huge improvement over Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) I am sorry but I don't think Joe Johnston is making a good films. He even screwed up my favorite film Jurassic Park III. Great movie! I didn't like the first Captain America but I LOVE this one. Great acting, great story, great action, great EVERYTHING. Marvel Studios continues to improve upon and expand this superhero universe and it shows with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The action is turned up, the performances are top notch, plus with the addition of Robert Redford raises the bar yet again. Chris Evans certainly owns this role know just as Downey owns Tony Stark. I LOVE LOVE LOVED the Iron Man trilogy. There are lots of great intrigue moments, though I think some of the biggest ""plot points"" on this one were spoiled thanks to the marketing and broader fan base knowledge of the whole ""Winter Soldier"" subplot in the comics. Regardless, it was a fun ride, albeit predictable as far as the internal politics end goes. The themes in this one are far more ""mature"" for a comic book movie, too--it almost felt more like a political action thriller à la Jack Ryan rather than a comic book based film, which made me love it even more. Phenomenal cast (the returns were fantastic as always, but the new characters also really did great work!), great music, the action sequences in this are SO awesome and generally I left this movie feeling very satisfied. I'm definitely going to see this more than once. It also makes me want to watch Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., which I haven't actually seen yet, but apparently there were plenty of references!Overall, this was a huge improvement on the first Captain America movie, which I actually didn't liked that much but it was a good movie. I'd venture to say I liked it more than The Avengers. D: Chris Evens gave us a wonderful performance as Captain America, it was the most Action comic book film I have ever seen! This film has a heart, it is Entertained, fast paced, filled with full of actions. Samuel L. Jackson did a wonderful job as Nick Fury, finally his character did something to do in this film, like fighting with assassins and so on. I loved him in this film much better than I did in Avengers : Age of Ultron (2015)in this film he has everything in it. Scarlet Johansson did a good job a supporting cast as Natasha Romanoff she wasn't annoying in here, she was a good supporter to cap. I hated her in Iron Man 2 and Avengers: Age of Ultron, but in this film I like her and I have enjoyed watching her in this film screen. This is the most wildest, most colorful team of superheroes ever brought to life on the big screen, is a massive success, a fan favorite and a critical darling. Winter Soldier, a tense, dramatic conspiracy thriller that somehow makes its strangest comic book elements work wonders, is a masterfully conceived and executed sequel that takes Captain America -- and, along with Guardians, the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe -- in a bold, exciting direction. Both are outstanding films. Both boast astonishing confidence, production design, action and visual effects. Both are terrific fun. Both represent a brave new world for comic book movies. And each one for completely different reasons. Which is Marvel's crowning achievement? How do you even compare the two? Answer: you don't. Other than ranking the films by personal preference, it's a fool's errand to pit Cap, Black Widow and Falcon against Star Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket and Groot. You sit back, think to yourself it's good to be a geek, soak it all in, and wait for the inevitable Avengers crossover. Love 'em both. Watch both of 'em over and over and over again. Enjoy each one on its own terms. Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) was probably my second favorite Marvel film of 2014 but this one Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a kick ass best film ever! This film kick's Joss Whedon's Failure Avengers Age of Ultron in to the ground! This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth.As Steve Rogers struggles to embrace his role in the modern world, he teams up with another super soldier, the Black Widow, to battle a new threat from history: an assassin known as the Winter Soldier. I love this movie and I don't care what anyone say! It Is my favorite best Marvel film of 2014!Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a 2014 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.

Previously to this a deep rescue submersible encounters it and the main guy, Jason Stratham is ignored. He gets called back to rescue others which is when this stupid movie really gets rolling. The effects are so-so changing from scene to scene. The best thing is when the little Yorkie who goes for a swim survives. This movie is a great video for how not to remain safe on any type of boat.

Lucy,"We watched LUCY about on DVD February this year. I usually don't like the typical shoot- them-up or speculative-futuristic or robotic movies, they turn me off because they are predictable and way over the deep-end of ridiculousness in their violence, special effects, contradictions and same-old-same-old tin spaceships, weaponry galore, and silly story; like the script and story were just thrown together for the sake of selling something at the box office or TV. LUCY, is excellent, credible beyond the usual mush and the action and actors are great. If you like a good story that will touch your heart, make you cheer and hope, take you to possible scenarios and just enough chaos to make it interesting, good actors and a great story, then you most like will like LUCY. My husband and I often have different likes and opinions but our differences came together in appreciation of LUCY.",negative

I certainly didn't expect serious Sci-Fi – after all, I had seen the trailers – but I actually wasn't quite sure what to expect (and I'm not sure I would have gone to see it at all, If it hadn't been directed by Luc Besson). Well, maybe it's just because I expected to be disappointed, but I was pleasantly surprised. 'Lucy' delivers a fast paced, crazy ride from start to finish, and I'm frankly a bit shocked so many people seem to hate this film with so much passion. Hadn't they seen the trailers? I thought it was clear from the get-go that this film was first and foremost meant as entertainment (and it certainly doesn't pretend to be the new '2001').If 'Lucy' were based on a comic book, I highly doubt people would be criticising it as harshly as they are. Let's be honest: from a scientific point of view, the stories of Captain America, Superman, Thor, the Hulk, Iron Man, Spider Man and the X-Men are all enthusiastically silly. None of these stories are even remotely realistic - and they were never meant to be: that's why they call them ""SUPER-heroes"". So how come so many film fans take the ""10% of the brain"" premise so very, very seriously? I mean, this is Luc Besson: 'The Fifth Element' was just as over-the-top and most people seemed to have really enjoyed it (at least at the time; maybe now it would also get shredded to pieces for ""lack of realism""). The way I see it, 'Lucy' is simply Besson's take on the superhero movie (towards the end of the film, the title character actually comes across like a fun, female version of Dr Manhattan).Granted, many aspects of 'Lucy' ARE very silly, but visually the film is absolutely stunning and it at least tries to tell an original story and throws in some very interesting philosophical (and yes: even scientific) concepts and questions. So not unlike the films based on Marvel or DC comics, this is a wild mix of Fantasy, Sci-Fi and Action elements – and what's so wrong with that all of a sudden? If you watch it for what it is – a fun, fast summer movie with inventive visuals – I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy it. Quality-wise, this certainly isn't 'The Matrix' or 'Blade Runner', for sure (but hey: what is?), but 'Lucy' is still packed with enough creative ideas and great action scenes to get your money's worth. Plus it features Morgan Freeman and an absolutely gorgeous Scarlett Johansson.So my verdict: It's rare enough these days to get an original Fantasy/Sci-Fi tale with a decent budget in the first place – let alone one for grown-ups with an R-rating. It may not be as good as it could have been (and it does feel a bit rushed), but it is very far from the catastrophic mess many critics make it out to be. As far as I'm concerned, 'Lucy' is a fun, crazy ride from start to finish. 7 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/In an ideal world, movies would be made without the aim for a certain rating.

Scoob!,"I realize that Scoob is basically a kids' cartoon generic movie. I realize that I am long past the target audience's age. However, I grew up a fan of the original Scooby Doo cartoon. I was 4 years-old when the cartoon originally aired and I have fond memories of those Saturday mornings. The people responsible for making these new movies have taken most of what made that show good and thrown it out the window. The ghosts and monsters weren't real. There was always a rational explanation behind everything that went on. Part of the fun was trying to wrap my 4 year-old brain around how the bad guys were doing their evil deeds. But a movie based in anything approaching reality wouldn't work as a big, over-bloated, CGI mess like SCOOB. It's unreal, it's loud, and it leaves nothing to the imagination. The film consistently makes fun of itself in that I'm-smarter-than-you, self-referential way that I find so annoying. It's a shame to me that young kids today will not grow-up understanding the charm of the original Scooby Doo.",negative
Scoob!,"It started well, with a touching scene of the main characters meeting for the forst time as kids (or puppies, in Scooby's case) and then having one of their traditional adventures. However, this only lasts 15 minutes, and from there the movie stops being a Scooby Doo movie and starts being a superhero movie, with Dick Dastardly as the supervillain, and Blue Falcon and his gang as superheroes, with the Scooby gang stuck there in a movie that is not their own.Because let's face it, just like in a James Bond movie we have certain expectations, in a Scoob movie we also have expectations, and they are not met. That distinctive type of adventures where they explore a haunted location and, after many scares, end up discovering that it was all a not supernatural trick by some criminal, is not here, except for a brief nod at the beginning. Instead, we get a generic modern children's movie, with characters running around from chase to chase, battle to battle and explosion to explosion without a compelling plot, while making pop culture references. The plot involves saving the world from a large-scale supernatural threat (really supernatural, none of the subversion characteristic of the source material).So, if we forget about wanting a Scooby Doo movie and focus on the movie we get, it's not very good either. You can see where they try to have jokes for the adult watchers, but they lack the wit and talent to make them funny. They occasionally remember that this is supposed to be a Scooby Doo movie, and they have traditional gags like having Scooby and Shaggy, in the middle of being chased by the critters, turn around and serve the critters as waiters, disconcerting them for a while, but it's too little and done without much talent. You also get a scene where two male characters fight and a female character says it's toxic masculinity, which is kind of a hateful message to send to children.In short, if you want a Scooby movie, this is not it, and if you want a generic modern kid's movie, this is not a good one.",positive

Godzilla: King of the Monsters,"Right from being a child and watching the Hana Barbera cartoons and stomping round the house pretending to be Godzilla, to being allowed to stay up till the early hours of the morning as a treat by my Dad to watch the Togo films on channel 4 here here in the UK I have loved Godzilla. How I wish he was still here today to have watched this glorious film with me.Baffled by many of the reviews saying to much Kaiju action or poor director etc.This film was clearly made by a dedicated and passionate Godzilla fan. The sheer amount of Easter eggs and fan service which had me grinning is incredible, (yet knowledgeable Godzilla fans on RT seem to not have noticed any of this) and talk about the likes of fire breathing dragons ><!Anyway the film is awesome. One of my favourite films of all time. Definitely my favourite Godzilla film.The effects are incredible.The music is awesome. You will be grinning from ear to ear at certain points.I actually like the human cast. I liked 2014 Godzilla but did not like the main cast Aaron Tailor Johnson. Did not have those issues here. They play imo a good supporting cast to the main cast you care about - The Titans :)!I'm super excited to see what happens next in the monsterverse.Make sure you stay till the VERY end of the credits scene or for a final scene hinting at wha could be to come ;)!I would also encourage you to write a review also should you watch and enjoy the film.

Overlord,"Starts fantastically shows parra troops going to be dropped behind enemy lines on D day and is so dramatic and tangible feels like you're having a past life memory, Sadly the film more or less crashes as the fist planes ditch. The characters are as one dimensional as would be expected in a pre school kids show. The storyline has more holes than a pepper pot. It's definitely not a horror film and it's a poor action film too. Any Stallone van dam or Arnold Schwarzenegger movie has ten times the depth this bag of garbage this has, the effects are a miss mash Great War action bits crossed with bad cgi I am legend rip off nazi things. The mass majority of the film is lifted directly from captain America the first avenger. Basically nazis are doing experiments on dead and living solders although it contradicts itself as the plot gos on by injecting them with tar no explanation of why. This creates a super solder. The bad nazi officer takes super syrup first then a plucky America corporal has to in order for him to fight the red skull opps I mean nazi rapist. It's so blatant I think marvel should sue for copyright. Even with all the fighting explosions and general action it's boring so badly so several people actually got up and left during the final third of the film. Badly written badly directed badly acted but it's not the actors faults hardly given much scope with this writing. Big budget effects on a bad bad B movie who's basic plot is injecting engine oil into nazis makes them react completely randomly some turn into 28 days later type things some turn into universal solders completely randomness.",positive

Vivarium,Full waste of time although I have a lot of free time due to lock down still this time could have been used for something else.,negative
Vivarium,"It seems many viewers were so distracted by the style of the film that they missed its substance. To me, the film is not a critique of suburbia or parenting but a horror film about the positive qualities of both. Spoilers are full steam ahead below...Humans are excellent parents. We parent our helpless infants for a shocking long time, we build safe houses for them - rain, lightning & earthquake-proof. We raise them in patterns; sweet quiet streets & cookie-cutter homes, cookie-cutter gender roles as parents. With such bountiful generosity & devotion, with such easily grasped roles, how could a brood parasite not take advantage?The aliens in this film are our cuckoos. They give us their child and we raise it in our own nest. We are trapped by our own humanity. When we see the newborn we feel parenthood instinctively. We cannot crush the newborn's head with a pickaxe, though we know it is not human. We feed & nurture the child - perhaps begrudgingly, abusively, neglectfully - but we feed and nurture it even as it grows larger than ourselves. It takes all our energy to care for it, draining our very lifeforce, but we keep doing it. We can find no other option... We are trapped by our own nature.Other critics seem to think the aliens lack motivation, or that they have totally alien motivation; researcher motivation. I don't think so. Like the cuckoo, they are only fulfilling their own nature. They cannot save their para-parents. They are doing this to survive - it is their role in the circle of life. Why? Perhaps because their life span is so short, perhaps because their extra-dimensional nature makes typical parenting impossible, perhaps just the quirks of evolution. They look at us as we would see a cow. And they know how valuable our milk is. They must drink it to survive, so the baby calf is turned to veal and we eat ice cream on hot days. But are they evil? Not unless your tapeworm is evil. Nature is amoral.It is our own morality - the love for a baby's face - that traps us. We cannot dig out of our morality, or outrun it, or outthink it. This movie is exceptional because it shows us how our freely given empathy could be used to entrap and enslave us. I guess the only escape from this trap is infanticide or suicide - making the brood parasite strategy untenable, but ending our own life in the process. A more cruel trap than Jigsaw ever made. Horror at its finest.",positive
Iron Man Three,"This is my first review and I'm writing it because the critics are all praising this film so much.Let me tell you, if you like Iron Man in any way and/or are familiar with the mythology, do not pay to watch this film. This is a poor excuse of a plot that outright spits in the face of fans and destroys one of Marvel's most powerful villains. Seriously, the Mandarin is Tony Stark's antithesis; their conflict was always the symbol for magic vs. science. Like Joker's insanity contradicts Batman's great use of logic. In Iron Man 3 they ruined him so bad only a reboot could save the character (and believe me, I hate reboots as much as everyone). The Mandarin is now used as a joke character with the main twist just playing for laughs (or in my case, tears). This guy should have ten powerful magical rings that alone could rival the Avengers' powers combined. Was this ""adaptation"" really the best thing to do? Magic CAN be done on the big screen, they've done Norse Gods! Ten Rings are nothing compared to that...Other than that, the film still wouldn't be good. Shane Black writes comedy action films, only this time the comedy is much more cringe worthy and not really funny, and the action probably sums up about 20% of the film. The main plot-device for armor malfunctions, power-downs and or stupid failures is so overused I was wondering how could they ever fill up 120 minutes without it. The actual Iron Man suit is so underused that you'll think this is Bourne or Bond you're watching. Also noteworthy: If a film relies on poop jokes for a quick laugh, it got as low as it'll ever get.Also, I must say Rhodes (War Machine) needs a plot arc. He's a tool. I love Don's work in the role and think he's charismatic (as are RDJ and Gwyneth), but he needs to have some kind of a story.Other new characters' besides the Mandarin are really hit and miss. This series' villains really have become one-note. We all know the bad guy is the one wearing the fancy suit that wants corporate power and tries to take over. Special mention goes to Maya, that one person who changes her mind all the time and leaves the film never having stepped in in the first place.Wait, I'm not done yet. There's also a kid ""side-kick"" and you guessed it. He's in an hostage scene! Well, that's some good innovative writing right there! All in all, this is as bad or even worse than X-Men: The Last Stand. Beware of the actual ending that retcons everything about Tony's back-story. I don't know how Marvel green-lighted this script, I really don't! I know any fan could have done it much better!",negative

X-Men: Days of Future Past,"I think that pretty much sums up the execs attitude when making this film. Great cast, excellent performances, spot on effects. Too bad the script was dog food. Lets start with the end of Xmen Last stand. Professor Xavier is killed right? Well the post credit scene suggests his consciousness survived. Although, we hear his voice, we don't actually see him (Patrick Stewart) cause it would be a whole new body, yes? Next comes Xmen Origins: Wolverine and First Class, nothing that ties this together. While X3 does close the book, it seems, on Scott and Jean, the fate of Charles Xavier is an unresolved issue. Third film comes in, the Wolverine, and again nothing...except, wait. The return of Magneto and Professor X. Wolverine is as stunned by this as we're supposed to be. But it eludes to the upcoming DoFP. So we open in a dystopian future where, ta da, there's Charles. No explanation or anything. 8 years and 4 films, and they fail to resolve this issue. By the way, that Wolverine end scene was as if that never happened, because DoFP takes place 8-10 years later.I also found it a contrived plot device that time moves in sync, essentially time passes minute by minute in the past for wolverine as it does in the future. Ergo, Logan ages six hours in 1972, he ages six hours in the future (guesstimated at 2022). I would conservatively put Logan's sojourn into the past to be roughly a week. So for one week solid kitty pride is kneeling over him doing the time-phase thing the ENTIRE TIME. I guess she doesn't need to eat, sleep, or poop. Lets also not forget there are a dozen mutants just hanging out all this time. In a world of super sentinels, you'd think they would want to stay mobile, keep moving. I'd like to know, wtf happened to the world to have a future like that, cause I must of blinked and missed it. X3 and the wolverine left the world in a good place for humans and mutants. Then ker-pow, now we use robots from the 70s? Funny, sentinels were never mentioned in the original films, save for a make believe scenario in the danger room in X3. Yet here they are. In fact, in the year 2000, it seemed the world was just waking up to the idea of mutants. Ohhh that's right, apparently as of now NONE OF THOSE FILMS EVER HAPPENED. I guess wolverine never gets his adamantium then. Ohhh wait, how did he have adamantium claws in the future when he lost them in the Wolverine?Xavier suddenly being alive is never explained. The serum he uses to walk again is horribly contrived. It's supposed to explain why we see him walking around in the flashback sequence in X3, as well as the cameo in Origins, but fails. He can walk at the expense of losing his powers. Well, he used them in X3 and Origins. And even so, if the serum later got ""perfected"", why wouldn't he use it all the time then? Furthermore, if the serum repaired his back, it did nothing for what happened to him at the end of this film where the steel beam crushes his legs. While seeing certain characters fully realized (iceman using his ice- slide), the film lost its soul. What made the original films so great where how the characters connected with the audience, the social/moral implications of being ""different"", and the whole judgement, acceptance, and belonging that was such a heavy element to these films has been watered down into movie action schlock. If this film had any real emotional weight, it would of been all those characters in First Class being killed off by the government and the horrible experiments they performed on them. But since this happened off camera and just given a mere mention in this film, the audience is significantly less impacted. ""awww, why they have to go and kill off Banshee?"" vs, ""OMG, you mother ******s, how could you? Avenge him!!!""Although the original films were always set in ""the near future"" there were never any elements that made it seem too futuristic. Like the 3d map in the first film, nothing like that existed but it was easy to see us progressing there. In other words, the world felt very real, grounded, believable. Now, it's 8-10 years after X3, and we got giant lasers, space ships, a re-imagined NYC skyline, etc. Like aliens in an Indiana Jones film, these things felt out of place. Then, we use Sentimels, which is far beyond our current technology and have them first invented in 1972? So before we even have the same technology that brought us Atari and cassette players, we have advance cybernetic hunter/killer robots? I get how putting metal in them while they were being shipped allowed Magneto to use his mutant power on them, but doesn't explain how he was able to reprogram them. He talks and they obey him, makes no sense....ahhhhh shut up and eat your popcorn. Ohhh, one last thing: Dear studio execs, please consider your largest demographic when choosing which characters bare butt to show off.",negative
X-Men: Days of Future Past,"With its mind-boggling premise and jaw-dropping cast, X-Men: Days Of Future Past blasts into cinemas bearing the weight of great expectations. Surely this mash-up of X-Men past and future has the potential to be the best superhero blockbuster our world will ever see? Well, yes and no.To be strictly objective, Days Of Future Past can occasionally come off as a little too earnest, its enormous cast of characters getting somewhat lost in the grinding of its narrative gears. But, when it works (which is most of the time), Days Of Future Past comes pretty darn close to nerdvana – this is a smart, rich film that effectively mines its source material (both the movies and Chris Claremont's classic 1981 storyline in the comic books) and its incredible cast for emotion, power and depth.Flash forward to the bleakest of futures. X-Men we have known – led by perennial frenemies Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Erik Lensherr/Magneto (Ian McKellen) – are being hunted mercilessly by a horde of intelligent, death-mongering robots known as Sentinels. With little hope for survival, the desperate X-Men decide to send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to the 1970s. There, he must find the younger Charles (James McAvoy) and Erik (Michael Fassbender) – several years estranged after the traumatic events of X-Men: First Class – and get them to change the future before it can happen.Sounds simple enough? Not really. Days Of Future Past frequently threatens to fall foul of its complicated puzzle-box of a narrative, one that involves time travel, quantum physics and a swirling mess of characters, action and motivations. There's Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), creator of the Sentinel programme, whose assassination in the past by Charles' pseudo-sister Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) brings about the dystopia of the future. There are prison breaks, astral projections, and several grisly mutant deaths. Truthfully, this incredibly ambitious mix of character, plot and spectacle could very easily go horribly wrong.What's so impressive about director Bryan Singer's return to the franchise is how well he weaves all the disparate threads of his narrative together. This is emphatically not the Singer who gave us mediocre misfires like Superman Returns and Jack The Giant Slayer. Rather, this is the work of the Singer who made his mark with films like X1, X2 and The Usual Suspects, all of which featured a masterful blend of wit and wisdom, character and story.In Days Of Future Past, Singer skilfully plays on the schism that opened up between Erik and Charles at the end of First Class to add welcome depths of emotion to the high stakes already in play. The deep, difficult relationship between the two men has always been the fulcrum of the series, and Singer allows it to breathe and grow. With the help of McAvoy and Fassbender (not to mention Stewart and McKellen), some of the best actors in the business, the director makes it possible to believe that resentment can give way to forgiveness, and vice versa, often in the blink of an eye. McAvoy, in particular, gives a shudderingly good performance as a man called upon to help others when he's lost his own way.With such an enormous revolving cast of characters, Singer even manages to give many – though not all – of them their hearts and souls. (Alas, Storm/Ororo, we will never know ye!) Thrust into the unlikely role of mentor to the broken, heartsore Charles, Wolverine must find a different sort of strength and ingenuity within himself. Jackman plays the role beautifully, anchoring the two timelines with charm and gravitas. Though still something of an awkward fit for her part, Lawrence, too, plays Raven's dilemma very well, as she wavers between Charles' offer of hope and Erik's often bloody single-mindedness.But Days Of Future Past doesn't just mire itself in the toss and tumble of its characters' emotional journeys. Singer throws in a few crackerjack action sequences, opening the film with a heart-stopping massacre that very effectively underscores the dire threat posed by the Sentinels of the future. Crucially, Singer also finds the time and space within the darkest shadows of his story to have a little fun, judiciously tossing quips and sight gags into the mix – particularly in a tour de force prison break sequence, in which the preternaturally speedy Pietro Maximoff (Evan Peters), better known to comic aficionados as Quicksilver, literally runs away with the entire show.Make no mistake about it, this is a behemoth of a film that won't go down well with everybody. Newbies will almost certainly find themselves lost, bewildered, and perhaps even bored. Singer's tale sprawls in so many directions that, if you're not at least marginally invested in the characters, it could prove to be a trying experience.But, for everyone else, ranging from casual fans to enthusiasts and obsessives, Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg have crafted something truly remarkable. Steeped in history and lore, both of the cinematic and comic-book variety, Days Of Future Past feels like a dark love letter to the spirit of that original band of mutants and the message of hope, tolerance and humanity that has always accompanied their attempts to find their place on Earth.Most remarkably of all, Days Of Future Past practically radiates a bravery and freshness that you'd never expect from the seventh film in a blockbuster franchise. Instead of playing it safe and sound, Days Of Future Past mashes up past, present and future, sweeping up a lot of what has been taken for granted in the X-Men cinematic universe and, well, chucking it out of the proverbial window. The ending of this film truly opens up an intriguing plethora of narrative possibilities that stretch in any and all directions. On the strength of this outing, that's something to be anticipated, rather than feared.",positive
Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2,"The animation is amusing to say the least, and the story is for kids and adults to enjoy. The actors doing the voices overs seem to match there cartoon counterparts. But Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and it's sequel, is no Toy Story, they are just meant for pure laughs nothing more.It was enjoyable time, no Oscar winner, but I don't think it was trying to be. The animated living food is well put together. And the scenery is amazing to watch. Bill Hader, Anna Faris and James Caan really bring there characters to life. Will there be a third one, who knows.

Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2,"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, answering all of those questions from the end of #1, is silly fun. Which is a good thing, seeing as how it's a cartoon aimed at little kids. And me, naturally. This was right up my alley.It's a simple story. That wonderful machine created by Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) that bestowed food falling from the sky for the island town of Swallow Falls has been deactivated, thanks to a plethora of food and a desire for people not to be harmed by chunks of sustenance dropping on them. Now the island must be cleaned up, and the corporation Live Corp., run by Flint's idol Chester V (Will Forte) gets the contract. The town's citizens are relocated temporarily while Flint realizes his lifelong dream and becomes an employee at Live Corp. The problem? It seems that the food created by the machine has become...sentient. And it's fighting back! Flint and his friends - Sam Sparks (Anna Faris), cameraman Manny (Benjamin Bratt), policeman Earl (Terry Crews, stepping in for Mr. T), Chicken Brent (Andy Samberg), Steve the Monkey, and Flint's dad Tim (James Caan) - head back to the island. The mission: locate the machine and shut it down. But it seems that Chester and his orangutan assistant Barb (Kristen Schaal) have other plans, plans too devious to mention in detail here, lest your eyes be singed.Anyway, here's the cool thing. The sentient foodstuffs are basically tangible portmanteaus of food and animal, like the wild tacodile, the watermelephant, the pie-thon, the cheespider, and the bananostrich. Luckily, most of these creatures were benign to begin with. I mean, there aren't any lions or tigers or bears or scorpions. Now, setting aside the question of what these Foodimals would eat, since they themselves are made up of food, these are creative inventions. Almost makes you want to buy one or two as stuffed animals.Meanwhile, back at the boat, Tim bonds with sentient pickles over fishing. I swear, I am so glad this movie was rooted in reality. I mean, sure, pickles probably couldn't cast that well, but still - kudos are deserved here.This is about Flint's needing to choose between his idol and his friends and family, between doing what he knows will help his inventing career and what he knows is right. It's about being reminded about those closest to you, lest you disdain their influence. It's also about being able to change one's mind in light of new evidence, and it's about not killing anything that has eyes and/or talks. It's also about 95 minutes.Hader is terrific, as is the supporting cast, even when they're not given much to do but run and hide. Or cackle evilly. I was more impressed with the vocalizations of the Foodimals, such as Barry the strawberry or the pickles, voiced by codirector Cody Cameron. Kind of thought Frank Welker had stumbled on set.No meatballs, ironically enough.",positive
Color Out of Space,"I was really looking forward to seeing this, and had just finished reading the short story this movie was based on. This travesty of a film could have been so so SO much better. I had to laugh a few times at the poorly written script and horrendous acting by everyone on the movie.There was probably 20 minutes left in the movie, but I couldn't take any more. The writing, editing and acting were plain awful. Nicholas Cage is a really bad actor, in almost every movie except Moonstruck and Raising Arizona. But I think this may be his worst.",negative
Color Out of Space,"I made the mistake to read reviews before watching the movie and missed the movie in its theater run. As usual the result was exactly the opposite that most of the negative reviews suggested, a situation which has become norm either way with IMDb reviews. If the bulk of them are positive, the movie sucks, if they are negative, the movie is great.Peronally, I found the movie a totally engaging experience from start to finish, it captivated me and I loved the scale of intensity slowly and methodically rising as the effects of the unearthly ball did to the protagonists.For me this is by far the best adaptation of this story, better and with faster pace than any previous one, including Die Farbe and the beloved Die Monster Die. Cage is his usual self, very believable despite his frequent overacting, as well as all the others excellent cast members . Some CGI could have been better, some humor felt a bit out of place but overall it was an excellent effort and surely Richard Stanley's best movie to date. As far as Lovecraft adaptations are concerned, I put this on the same level with The Resurrected, Dagon and even Roger Corman's The Haunted Palace",positive
Ant-Man,"Went to see ""Ant-Man"" the other day. I have no idea how it is getting its 4 star rating, the 79% Rotten Tomatoes rating seems about right to me. So I guess you either love it or you hate it. Me well I only wish I had gone to see Terminator for the 4th time instead. I felt is was a waist of an opportunity.Way too much time was spent on explaining ""Ant-Man"" and no enough time was spent on action. And as for the Science well while it might be possible to shrink someone by reducing the space between their molecules. If you make anything larger it would tend to have the effect of turning a solid into a gas. (Wait to the near the end of the movie see what I mean).The Ant man suite itself turns out to be a very flexible thing it can either be warn by Michael Dogulas aka Dr Hank Pym or Paul Rudd, Scott Lang or his Daughter Evangeline Lilly yes one size Ant-Man suite really does fit all? I only wish my clothing was as flexible as this suite.I could go on but I will stop there. I would suggest go see it for yourself see what you think but only once Terminator is no longer on in your cinema and if you do not have any children with you that might get easily bored. All if you do decided to go see it do not leave until the very last of the credits have finished or you could quite possibly miss the best thing about this movie. And I do mean the very end of the credits not half way though.",negative
Ant-Man,This movie is incredible. A ton of fun with brilliant action and hilarious dialogue this is another fantastic win for Marvel. Paul Rudd plays a likable and charismatic hero who really makes you root for him and his goals. Michael Pena is the real heist of this film as he steals every scene that he is in. Corey Stoll as the villain was a fantastic choice from Marvel. He can play the corporate business man and an intimidating villain. The visuals are stunning in this film. All of the tiny ant scenes are visually outstanding and hilarious. The are two post credit scenes which are fantastic and really tie into the larger universe. Ant Man is a fantastic movie which is worth your money and I suggest that you see it in cinemas.,positive
Alien: Covenant,"It seems that in 'Alien: Covenant', Ridley Scott and his writers tried to use the best loved elements from previous Alien installments to appease those fans of the franchise who hated 'Prometheus' - but perhaps also to camouflage their intention to make a far meaner and less conventional blockbuster than what modern audiences (and studios) are willing to accept in this age of superheroes. It was my impression that what on the surface appears to be a very straight forward - and some might even say derivative - retread of familiar story beats is actually just a ploy to delve even deeper into the themes explored in 'Prometheus'. Because 'Alien: Covenant' not only continues to ""dissect"" the creator/creation/creature dynamic: it brings the android David's storyline to its perverse, if somewhat logical, conclusion.Now if you hated 'Prometheus', or just dismissed it as a dumb movie where most characters are stupid and nothing is explained or makes sense, you won't find much to like in the less conventional story elements in 'Alien: Covenant', and you might as well stop reading this review now (btw, if you still have questions about 'Prometheus', you'll find a link to an article explaining everything by clicking on my username). But if you DID like it - or at least found its maliciously ironic religious subtext and musings on creation fascinating - you'll probably find some aspects of 'Alien: Covenant' highly enjoyable. As you might recall, the cycle of creation depicted in 'Prometheus' goes as follows: the Gods (aka ""the Engineers"") create mankind - mankind creates David - David in turn starts to experiment on his creators (the humans) in order to create something new.The totally insane - and hilariously mean spirited - continuation/escalation of that cycle in 'Alien: Covenant' (beware: spoilers abound for the whole movie follow): David's ambition to make the jump from creation to creator has grown exponentially; it now entails nothing less than to exterminate the Gods, as well as experimenting on them - which makes him kind of hard to top in the mad scientist (or mad killer robot) department. By killing the Gods, he, the unworthy machine and ""2nd class"" creation conquers ""Paradise/Heaven"" and becomes the sole creator (humans are degraded to the status of lab-rats), thereby closing the cycle started in 'Prometheus'.Admittedly, the film is uneven in terms of story and pacing - but I admire its ambition. 'Alien: Covenant' is a fascinating hybrid which somehow halfway through its running time turns from relatively straight sci-fi and very familiar Alien terrain into a brooding, Gothic horror film (at least for a while before it turns back into a more conventional sci-fi/action film). In the Gothic part of the film, the man-made monster/creature (David) has turned the table and assumed the role of Dr. Frankenstein to make creatures of his own design. These creatures - who appear to be the first actual Xenomorphs - reflect and reveal who/what David really is and how deceiving his human looks are. For although he inherited some very human traits from his creator (emotions, curiosity, ego, the urge to create - among others) he is still a machine adhering to a logic that is ultimately as alien (pun intended) to a human being as the Xenomorph itself - and as lethal. Which is why it makes complete sense that David is the ""designer"" of this perfect, machine-like organism (Swiss artist H.R. Giger, who created the original Alien, called it ""biomechanoid"" for a reason).In 'Alien: Covenant', David is the humans' - and humanity's - ultimate adversary; in fact, for the purpose of the story told in the film, he is the Devil (he even quotes Satan's famous lines from John Milton's epic poem 'Paradise Lost'). Now if the Devil in this tale were to create life in HIS own image (his REAL image - for David was only given human features to make interaction with him more ""comfortable"" for the humans), surely, he would create demons: and isn't the Xenomorph the ultimate demon sprung straight from the darkest pits of Hell? That 'Alien: Covenant' is essentially a riff on Milton's 'Paradise Lost' was the most surprising aspect of the film for me. David's story-line follows Satan's (quite literal) ascent to Heaven (Paradise), where he kills the Gods and starts his own rule, thus turning it into Hell and ending the age of man (and for those of you who think I'm reaching a little here: the film's title was originally supposed to be 'Alien: Paradise Lost'). Now regardless whether you liked the film or not, you have to admit: that's not exactly the texture of a generic, conventional blockbuster, right?At the end of the film, David is aboard the spaceship Covenant - which he has turned into a perverted version of Noah's Arch - and travels to a new world where he plans to start his new version of Genesis. He might even start a new religion: the Bible as written by a mad killer robot with a god complex (just think about how crazy demented - and completely wonderful - that sounds). Imagine the Lovecraftian nightmare he will create and what creatures will populate ""his"" version of Earth. I would love a sequel to 'Alien: Covenant' to take us there and finally fully descend into madness. It would be the logical next step: after the human protagonists visited an angry god in 'Prometheus' who wanted to destroy humanity, and then discover that Heaven is empty and the Gods are all dead in 'Alien: Covenant', they should next visit the Devil in his newly created Hell. My suggestion for a title: 'Alien: Genesis'.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",negative
Alien: Covenant,"I have to say. I was more eager than ever to see this film. The trailers were great (if not slightly spoiler filled) I was super keen on seeing Danny McBride playing a serious role, and I was more than eager to see something that would pull the Alien up from the nose dive it have become. But when the credits rolled, oh man was I disappointed. This movie is actually a massive step down from Prometheus.The problems with this film are vast, but some struck me more than than others. For one, it actually felt amateur. Considering Ridley Scott made the iconic origin film, it's hard to understand how tragically he has failed to grasp what makes the Alien film great. There is no slow burn atmosphere here. No tension build up. No creepiness to the xenomorph itself. It just fails to do anything that the predecessors do. The film also makes the same mistakes as Prometheus did, by giving the characters terrible motives or at best, strange decision making capabilities. Nothing really makes sense. There are so many times where you wonder to yourself, 'if this is suppose to be such an important mission, why are they making such ridiculous choices?'My next big gripe is with the visual effects. They are awful. Again, a huge step down from Prometheus (which at least had that going for it). The action scenes with the xenomorph were spastic and often hard to follow.Characters were plain, story was beyond boring, plot was ill thought out, and the only likable character who makes sense is the villain!It just failed overall to make a decent movie, and I am tired about giving movie justice just because 'at least the effects were good' or 'at least the sound was great'. If the film can't stand up with its own story, then it is a bad film. And as sorry as I am to say, this is a bad film. Neill Blompkamp should be handed the reins, as at least he has vision which could benefit the franchise.",positive
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,"Don't waste money, no story, you don't feel for the characters. The end is so abrupt every one was waiting that at least director would give one good scene, but credits appear.2/3 movie is about last movie and it was too hard to relate to any character and you feel what do I care...in last 30 minutes games start, no parallel story lines for other participants, again you feel I don't care if they win or loose. The action scenes are very average and the entire movie is so predictable.It does not deserve this high rating. You will find it uninteresting and hard to retain interest for 2 hours and 40 minutes.",negative
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,I find lord of the rings overrated. This is the kind of movie that we want in the name of adventure. Slow at times but the charismatic personality of Jennifer Lawrence does not let the movie tear apart. Concept was a little bit new. Content is always the king.,positive
Free Birds,"So yeah, a thanksgiving movie about two turkeys going back in time to keep turkeys from being eaten at the first thanksgiving. Setting aside the fact that they probably weren't the main course if they were eaten at all, nobody should have expected this to be anything but a stupid kids' movie. But, I at least expected it to be that, a stupid kids' movie. Calling this movie a stupid kids' movie is an insult to stupid kids' movies. Let's start with what I'll be generous and call a story. Owen Wilson is a turkey. E-I-E-I-O. I'll be kind and have that be the only time I make that joke. Owen Wilson turkey is the turkey chosen for the presidential pardon, despite the fact that he doesn't fulfill a single one of the qualifications, and lives a cushy life with TV and all the product placement Chuck-e-cheese pizza he can eat. Then, a buff turkey named Jake shows up and tells him that he's on a quest from the ""Great Turkey"" to stop thanksgiving from ever happening. And there's your problem right there, that's the dumbest thing I've ever written. And that's not even the dumbest thing to happen in the movie. From there, they break into a government lab and steal a time machine, voiced by George Takei, who turns in one of the only good performances this movie has, simply on his greatness alone, and the time machine somehow understands the turkey's voice commands. They end up three days before the first Thanksgiving at Plymouth, and they're immediately chased by an over the top villain hunter until they're saved by the local turkeys, and from there, you have three choices of plots, Dances with Wolves with turkeys, Pocahontas with turkeys, or Avatar with turkeys. Just replace the natives with turkeys or have the people be cannibals and it's pretty much the same plot. And then, the last few scenes happen. Thesis papers could be written about everything wrong with the ending. If anybody cares about spoilers, now would be the time to stop. So, anybody over the age of 10 should be able to figure out that Owen Wilson turkey is the ""Great Turkey"" that Jake saw in the past, but it takes 4 of him to even get close enough to have George Takei tell him. Yes, they do the time travel movie thing where he tells himself what's going on, but that could be forgiven if it wasn't done so stupidly. Then he does the thing where he goes back in time and starts the plot, again, cliché, but forgivable. Then, the movie gave up. There's no other explanation for what happens next. You may want to be sitting down for this next part. So, the turkeys are going to attack the settlers after they burnt down their home (with flaming pumpkin catapults(I know, stay with me)). The settlers rationally respond by attacking them with cannons (though to be fair, the turkeys destroyed their guns, which, to be fair again, you'd have to be dumb to have happen). Then, just as they're about to be destroyed by cannon fire, a group of Indians show up and say ""those are some angry birds"". If you're dumb enough to stay in the theater after that, like I was, then you'll realize that is the high point of this last act. Owen Wilson turkey comes down in the time machine and stops all the cannonballs mid-shot and absorbs all the cannons and the evil hunter into a magnetic vortex. Then, he comes down off the time machine, and George Takei tells them all that Owen Wilson turkey is the ""Great Turkey"", and he gives them the gift that will stop the settlers from eating turkey. Pizza. He brings a ton of Chuck-E-Cheese pizza for them. I tried to walk out then, but my sister didn't let me. And the Turkeys, Settlers and Indians lived happily ever after. Owen Wilson turkey gets Stands-With-A-Fist/Pocahontas/Natari turkey to fall in love with him and stays with the colonial age turkeys, and Jake stays in George Takei and goes off to, I don't know, fight crime through time or something. And George Takei finishes the movie off with one of his classic ""Oh My""s. I have exactly four good things to say about this movie. One is George Takei's always great to hear, even if he is totally wasted. Two, the only real laughs that didn't come from him came from self aware people in hazmat suits at the laboratory, and they at least knew how dumb the idea of turkeys messing with a time machine was, even if everybody else in the facility didn't. Three and four are two good scenes in this. One scene is when the hunters find and subsequently destroy the turkey's nest. There is actually a good scene here, it's shot well, there's actual tension, and it belonged in a better movie. The last is when Owen Wilson turkey takes Pocahontas turkey up in the time machine and they're looking down on the earth. Pocahontas turkey starts asking questions, and a better movie could have taken this aspect further. But none of that saves this from being an overall brain dead movie with about as much respect for its audience as it does for history. I have never wanted to eat a turkey sandwich more in my life, and I can't wait for thanksgiving this year.",negative
Free Birds,"I'll preface this by saying that this movie was basically made for me (a sci-fi loving poultry scientist), so you may not find it as spectacular as I did. But it is still a good movie and certainly worth the watch. Also the obligatory ""this is a review it might spoil something"". I don't know what many of the other reviewers went in to this movie thinking so I will tell you flat out. This is a movie about TURKEYS THAT TIME TRAVEL. It is not some deep, complex movie that tells a detailed story. It's a light, funny movie to sit back and relax with. If you must have 50 different plot twists and 1000 characters for a film to be good, go watch game of thrones. If you want a nice funny movie that you don't have to think about, crack open a beer and watch this one. There's enough of a story to follow along and enjoy, but it's not excessive. The animation was good, though I didn't see the 3D version. I can't find any fault with the voice acting, and you will probably recognize many of the voice actors from other roles. The jokes were simple but effective- I was laughing pretty much the whole way through. Go in to it with the intent to enjoy a simple funny movie, and you will do just that. This is a very well put together movie that I hope more people get to enjoy.Oh ya, it seems s lot of people think this movie is pushing some kind of agenda. IT ISN'T. My job is literally the same as the scientist shown in the movie (I research poultry in a lab), so I am used to seeing anti farming propaganda. This movie is just a semi accurate portrayal of how a highly intelligent turkey would probably act, given freedom and the timeship Henterprise.",positive
Divergent,"When reading the book, I had concerns about how well it would translate to film. It's a book without much action and most of the narrative is internalized to the protagonist. Books like that tend to struggle to adapt well and Divergent is no different. The director tried to make changes to the story in order to try and make it work but I honestly think it was futile. It's just not a good story for a 2-hour interpretation. Even at that, I would rather have seen the story stay true and struggle to adapt than change and struggle. All in all, it was set up to fail from the beginning. Shailene Woodley and Theo James gave solid performances and the special effects and action sequences were done well but they made the film watchable and slightly enjoyable at best.",negative
Divergent,"In a post-apocalyptic dystopia, the world is destroyed and only Chicago has survived with a society divided into five factions: Abnegation (the selfless), Amity (the peaceful), Candor (the honest), Dauntless (the brave), and Erudite (the intelligent). The teenager Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) belongs to the Abnegation that rules the society but she fells outcast and attracted by the Dauntless. When she is sixteen years old, she is submitted to an aptitude test to indicate in which faction she will stay for the rest of her life, but she learns that she has aptitude to be in the Abnegation, Erudite and Dauntless. Further, she learns that she is a Divergent that is destroyed by the government. On the next day, she chooses to join the Dauntless where she changes her name to Tris and is trained by Four (Theo James). They fall in love with each other and soon Tris discovers that the Erudite are planning to take over the power from the Abnegation and become the ruling faction. ""Divergent"" is an adventure movie with a dull and lame story based in a stupid and senseless concept of society. The dystopia does not make any sense and everything is idiotic in the story: the society, the plot, the romance, the way the Dauntless jump from the train, the conclusion. If there is a faction formed for the most intelligent people, it seems to be obvious that they should rule this chaotic society. Tris kills many soldiers but she leaves Jeanine alive in the end. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Divergente"" (""Divergent"")",positive
Under the Skin,"I have to admit that I did not see the first minutes of the film. Neither have I read the book therefore I will write about this film as if it was a piece of art on its own, which it is.Under the Skin is a new picture from Jonathan Glazer, who has also directed Birth with Nicole Kidman and some music videos for bands like Radiohead. The main character, alien Laura, is played by the famous actress Scarlett Johansson.Firstly, there is no obvious narrative in this film, because it does not have a big significance or importance here. On the most basic level it is a story of an alien imposing a woman and seducing men from all over Scotland in order to drain their flesh. This is the most simple summary of the movie. On deeper layers it is a serious study of our society. The film's main focus is on the inside and outside of things, the philosophy of form and material. Johansson's character is struggling in this society. She is always portrayed as going against the stream, she is lost in the sea of rushing people who do not want to get deeper into things, because they know they could be hurt. This is represented in a very subtle visual way. For instance, roses look nice in the film, but they have spikes which make rose seller's hands bleed. A piece of cake seems delicious, but the taste of it is disgusting. It is always the fight between the surface and depth in this film, the first impression and further investigation. I believe it is a very important theme for our society where people are afraid of making commitments or engagements, where they seek for quick pleasures, even though they need true and honest love. The film is very strong visually and stylistically. In order for the reader to get a glimpse of what it is, I will say that it is sort of a combination of Kubrick, Lynch and von Trier.Kubrick - for using clever cinematic language, for all the subliminal messages that are there like a sign on a building saying ""Open 24"" which is pretty ironic as nobody in the film is truly open. The director deliberately plays with this open and closed concept a lot. The music is somewhat similar to Eyes Wide Shut's too and I think it is used to the fullest in Under the Skin as a form of expression. One can also feel the influence of 2001: A Space Odyssey with all those shots of abstract liquids and close-ups of a human eye.Lynch - for the dreamy, surreal sequences and the guy with the ugly face. I see it as a direct reference to his film The Elephant Man where he also talks about the inner beauty of a human being.Von Trier - for the sea scene (Breaking the Waves), for the foggy scenes in the woods (Antichrist). Like it usually happens with von Trier's work, someone might blame this film of cheap shock value. I do not think that is the case. The film is being a little provocative, indeed, but at the same time all those provocations are reasoned by the message the director wants to convey.So one can easily feel some influence from other directors, maybe some references, but I should say that this film does not lack originality at all. The directing decisions and the choice of music are as strong as the 2.5 minute close-up of Nicole Kidman's face in Birth. If you have seen that scene, you know what you are dealing with here.Even though, in my opinion, the images are very meaningful and extremely powerful, Under the Skin has received a lot of contrasting responses. Personally, I think the film is a masterpiece and it is worth the Golden Lion, but there are people who actually hated it and booed at it after having seen it. I cannot really understand why they did that, but I think it is good when a piece of art inflicts emotions and receives such different responses. It means that it is not mediocre and that it will cause discussions, maybe some self reflection which is always a good thing. The film suggests that I should get more into details, analyse things carefully from beginning to end, but I will not, just because I want other people to see it first and make their own conclusions. But obviously Under the Skin demands a bigger analysis than this one. I will just say that I was blown away by what I saw on the screen and by what I heard from the speakers. I hope I will get to see it again on the big screen. It has so much power and it is questioning the most important, essential things about our existence - our values as human beings. Where are we going, where are we rushing? Maybe we need to stop and look at the beauty around us? Maybe we should stop being superficial about others? Or maybe we are empty like balloons ourselves? For me it is definitely the best film from the 70th Venice Film Festival and one of the best films I have seen in my life.",negative
Under the Skin,"The problem with movies like this is that you have the people who hate slow, mysterious movies and it's automatically 1 star because there were no car chases or dubstep, and the people that feel they have to defend anything quiet and ambiguous like this and give 9 or 10 stars. ""So boring"" vs ""You just don't get it, man"". These types of films always only get 1 or 10 ratings. Really, it's not possible to make a so-so version?Sometimes people try to make moody, interesting, thought provoking, different kinds of movies and just don't do a great job. This film was right up my alley in every way, but in the end I just said ""meh"". It wasn't awful, but it did feel a little dull and needlessly drawn out, seemingly because there just wasn't enough to say to fill the time. There also wasn't much to get, really people, it's not that deep or obtuse. If there had been more eye candy (besides the obvious) I could have dealt with the other weaknesses easier. But I didn't think the visuals were all that interesting as a lot of people seem to. The whole thing was very film school and didn't totally feel like the work of a mature director, but if you told me it was a student film or something a first timer made on credit cards I would have believed you and said ""hey nice effort, keep at it"". I would like to give it more than a 4 just because it's totally my kind of film, but it really didn't deserve it, and as I said, that's the problem with these kinds of movies, people voting for what kind of film they like instead of how good this particular one was.",positive
The Lobster,"The film's concept: all adults who have recently lost a partner through death or divorce are sent to a hotel, where if they do not fall in love within 45 days, they are surgically transformed into an animal of their choosing. ''A lobster's a great choice''.I try not to explain the film's plot when somebody asks, so as not to completely dissuade them from viewing. Maybe this ridiculous concept is in reference to how ridiculous forcing someone to fall in love due to common interests is, or even just forcing someone to eventually get married, a practice common in the modern world. A comment on the societal pressures put on single adults. There are constant references and reminders to how even numbers are perfect, a couple. There is a further commentary on applying limiting labels and boxes to people, bisexual not being an option on the sexuality question, no half-sized shoes.Collin Farrell and Rachel Weisz, along with the many minor characters, all add to the film greatly. There are no weak actors which I could point out. The screen writing can be fast and witty at times, but I felt the ''quirkiness'' was definitely overdone. The robotic and monotonous speech pattern was generally funny but also overdone.I have spoken to many people who do not enjoy this film, and I can definitely respect and understand their opinion. The Lobster is not for everyone, with it's strange plot, writing and imagery. It's script is similar to that of a Wes Anderson film, but still remains very dark, and at times, disturbing. It is without a doubt, a slow film, heavily reliant on dialogue (which many people won't even find funny).I would recommend the film to people who enjoy quirky films such as Frank, Juno or The Grand Budapest Hotel, although The Lobster is definitely darker than those examples.Probably one of the strangest film I've ever watched.",negative
The Lobster,"There's no chance that you'll see a film as weird as The Lobster this whole year. In what is effectively an indie art-house piece, you get a completely insane and almost unfathomable world filled with more and more absurdities everywhere you look. However, it's such an incredibly unique and eye-catching film that it's still hugely engrossing and surprisingly entertaining to watch.The story centres around one man, played by Colin Farrell, as he attempts to find a partner as a part of this bizarre system. The first act revolves around his time in 'The Hotel', and is not only hugely odd, but both dramatic and unnerving as well as hilarious to watch, featuring some of the best dark comedy written in years.The film takes its story as seriously as any drama, and you feel that through the deeply disturbing atmosphere that emerges off the screen. However, as the film is just so weird, it eases you into the oddness of it all very impressively through the use of humour, something that more pretentious art-house films fail to do, and are resultantly a lot harder to really get into.So, you'll definitely be laughing a lot, if not in a more disturbed than hugely entertained manner, throughout the first act, and by the end of it, you'll surely be as used as you can be to the incredibly weird feel of this whole film.Just to give you an idea of how unorthodox this film is, every scene is full of awkward silences, the actors speak as if they're reading off of cue cards with no emotion whatsoever, the imagery is very ugly and unpleasant to look at right the way through, and the incredible slow pace of it all means that the film feels like it goes on for about five times as long as it actually does.And yet, I still can't get around the fact that this is a brilliant film. Mainly, it's the fact that it's just so unique and almost shockingly bizarre, but it's just filled with so many captivating ideas that it's impossible not to be fully drawn into this insane story.So, the performances, the directing, the writing, and pretty much everything is stunning, apart from one big issue that prevents this from being a truly incredible film. Following the end of the first act, the film does lose its way quite a lot, taking almost too big a leap into an even stranger abyss than you ever imagined at the beginning, and, with a little less humour in the latter stages, isn't as easy to watch as the first act had been.However, it does pick up again towards a terrifying and as bizarre as ever conclusion, and that's why I'm going to give The Lobster a 9 out of 10, but I must warn you that if you feel you can't cope with this film for longer than the first twenty minutes, then it's not for you. This is definitely a cult film for the ages, but won't be a big hit with general audiences.",positive
