Celal ile Ceren,"Well I don't know how to state this without sounding like a pessimist, but it was clearly the worst $10 I have ever spent. I had high expectations for this movie, the name suggests that it has a completely different setting than the actor/producer's previous movies (Recep Ivedik series), which were a complete disaster in my opinion, but unfortunately it was complete rubbish and I had to leave after 80 minutes. If you are fine with paying for a movie in which the most important element is people farting, then by all means, go ahead and watch it. If you are looking for your money's worth, buy some grass and watch it grow. It's way more fun and enjoyable than this movie. If you are really curious about why this movie got so many bad reviews, just wait until it's being sold in the $0.99 bin at your local grocery store. If you do, make sure to have a neurological check later on because it could really mess you up.",negative

Sairat,"I don't know Marathi. By mistake we gone to the wrong screen and could not stop our self to watching Sairat.After login here i just check my activities. I saw just rate my fav list 10 stars. This is not so fair! No Really....I can just love or hate movies! After years I have seen something that touched my heart. So 10 stars for 'Sairat' too!  This is undoubtedly a masterpiece of Cinema. Beautiful cinematography...flying birds, farms, sun, grass, plants and a well. 9 Rasa are used in the movie...I fill.  Acting part is very very natural. Characterization is unique yet so realistic. This makes movie all time fresh. Once you watch and you can't flavor of the movie ever. Music is awesome...Not Overpowering the visuals. Unfortunately i not understanding the lyrics ...but still singing!  Sudden sarcasm, harshness and shown very beautifully. I am a guy who always dreamed to make movies....this is so inspiring to me. Big thank you to the makers. Sairaat Jhala ji!",negative
Sairat,"This is not a review of this film. It is an attempt to explain few things before you watch this film, so that anyone without a proper knowledge of what exactly the ""story"" wants to express to viewers will at least get an idea of what the film is all about.This film is about a boy and a girl who falls in love - a boy is from one caste and a girl from another caste. Problem rises between them because the fusion of different castes is not allowed in India. What exactly caste is? It is nothing but fabricated way of dividing a population into a ""caste"". The fusion of different castes as I said is not allowed and it is the religion that supports this notion.To the people who have no idea of how caste system works - be it people who live in India or live outside of India have to remember this only - It is this - Caste System works in two forms – In its preserving form, it makes intermarriage i.e. exogamy impossible and when caste switches to its religious form, it makes Untouchability prevailing in modern times.Rest, the film will do the talking!",positive
Badrinath Ki Dulhania,"typical Bollywood cliché.guy falls in love after dancing once with her in a marriage.proposes her next day.girl clearly states she is not interested.like any sensible guy he follows her till she says yes.girl runs away from alter.guy again goes after her and again follows her.off course there is DJ song and montage of Singapore because that's very imp part of story. guy comes back drinks some alcohol, fights with his dad that he is too much control freak and voilà now girl is back and in love. so original, so mesmerizing.",negative
Badrinath Ki Dulhania,"Varun is phenomenal. Hats off hero. Amazing actor, from his various films. Great emotional scene performer as good as natural comedy. Very nice human being n down to earth. Keep it up. BDK. Varun at his best with comedy timing and dialogue delivery. Wowie; Alia has been as cute as her always. Both Varun and Alia have proved they can do movies to challenge their acting skills, highway, and not just movies like student of the year.BDK proves their amazing comic timings, great chemistry. Perhaps, this is the cutest couple of Bollywood industry. It is a complete entertainment movie.Well done team BDK. Hats off to very well written script and director for this amazing experience. KUDOS. KEEP IT UP. THANKS FOR THIS WONDERFUL MOVIE.",positive
Lootera,"Absolute masterpiece. A journey you get lost in. The simplicity of the the time yet the attention to detail in every scene adds visual appeal that is so palpable, yet blends with the movie without distracting from the theme and characters! I loved it. You should too! Movies such as Lootera is the reason I continue to come back to Bollywood for more! Contrary to common opinion, I found the movie to flow at a perfectly normal pace. There is a major event, twist or turn every couple minutes to keep the story moving along. Any faster and the movie would seem rushed. We all had our jaws dropped at the intermission. The first half was simply superb!",negative
Lootera,"Neither ""Pakhi""(Sonakshi) nor ""Varun""(Ranveer) are the main character of this film. Now if you think that i am joking then you should watch it. For me the main character of this movie is SILENCE and it is something awkward for a Hindi movie nowadays but that's true. The whole movie is show through silence , eyes , facial expression , visuals, surroundings and last but most important background score. This movie is not going to create the kind of magic that ""Udaan"" did but its a different genre movie and very real. Now if you love to see a story not by dialogues but through expression then this is something you must watch and for other people just find two n half hour a real silence of their life.",positive
Gunday,"The movie was probably aimed at being on of those a masala flicks with bromance, romance, song sequences, tragic background and what not. But half an hour into the movie and it all went for a toss due to a very very weak script. The on screen appearances of the actors was good but it wasn't really backed by any actual acting.The dialogues were over cheesy and ludicrous in all aspects. Probably Priyanka Chopra was the only watchable element of the movie (or may be I am being biased).Frankly an hour into the movie and i really felt like leaving (I don't know why i didn't). Trust me guys, its one of those movies which is meant to be forgotten and if you haven't watched it and are planning to, then forget the time and money that you are going to waste on this and just save yourself from the agony that might scar you.The only way this movie could be watchable is with a group of friends who are making fun of everything possible whilst the movie plays.",negative

Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania,"Humpty Sharma ki Dulhania, Shashank Khaitan's film, is an attempt to relive the magic of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, but definitely in its own way. DDLJ was one of the major blockbusters that Bollywood industry has seen and it gave a new attitude to the youngsters. Humpty Sharma ki Dulhania may not be the DDLJ of this decade, but yes, it is a movie in a true filmi style and it would bring smile to your face for sure. It does not ride high as far as logic is concerned. The movie definitely has some warm and emotional moments. The story is definitely predictable - girl meets the boy, both fall in love in spite of girl's engaged status, and then the pursuit for marriage by taking efforts to get the approval of family. The movie sticks to its core purpose – entertainment in filmy style, romance, comedy  This movie is for that segment of audience who just wants to watch movie for sheer entertainment and can't tolerate rona-dhona.Attitudes of the lead protagonists Rakesh 'Humpty' Sharma and Kavya Pratap Singh (Alia Bhatt) are shown initially itself in almost parallel frames, one being a carefree 'cool' Delhi guy, who flirts, always ready with witty one-liners and the later one a feisty Ambala girl. Humpty has friends Shonty (Gaurav Pandey) and Poplu (Sahil Vaid) who are always there for him. Humpty is shown to share great friendly relationship with his father (Kenny Desai). Humpty is a hard-core DDLJ movie fan, who still weeps towards the end of the movie. Kavya wears her attitude through the tattoo 'Pataka' on back side of her neck. According to her - ""Main to paida hi hot hui thi"". She is part of a rich family who is engaged to a NRI. She negotiates with her father Pratap Singh (Ashutosh Rana) to get her designer Lahanga worth 5 Lakhs. The logic is she did not get a chance to choose the guy, so at least she should get the right to choose her lehanga. Also, her friend Gurpreet of Delhi has bought a Lehanga of 2.5 Lakhs, so she should go for a lehanga of at least double the price. Kavya makes all these scenes very very enjoyable with her innocence. When Pratap Singh sweetly says no to her lehanga demand, she informs the family that she is going to Delhi (her uncle stays there), would earn and buy herself designer Lehanga and return after attending her friend Gurpreet's (Guncha Narula) marriage. Kavya meets Humpty in Delhi in a hilarious situation. Let me not reveal the same. Humpty and Kavya hit off instantly. They do fight, enjoy parties, competes over guzzling beer. Banter between the two is fun, natural, lovable. Both move ahead without any serious ties. They collectively help Gurpreet get out of a messy situation. And then the moment comes, when Kavya has to come back to Ambala. Shashank Khaitan has not redone Raj-Simran here, when Humpty and Kavya bump into bed soon after they feel for each other. Both of them try to move on lives in their respective cities without each other, but unable to do so. Humpty comes to Ambala along with Shonty and Paplu. Yes, a series of physical assault happens once family learns of Humpty's love for Kavya, but the tone of the violence is mellowed down. Humpty manages to get some time from Pratap Singh to prove him that he is the right choice for Kavya, better than the NRI Angad Bedi (Sidharth Shukla). Humpty's challenges increase when Angad does the entry into the scene as Mr. Perfect.How is Angad as a guy? We know that Humpty and Kavya would unite at the end, but how? The treatment to the plot is done in a very light-hearted manner. How does Pratap Singh yield? How does Humpty win Kavya's family's hearts?Cast is just superb. Ashutosh Rana as Kavya's father is very good. What a wonderful actor he is. He pours his intensity as well as sense of humour into the character. Varun Dhawan has done complete justice to his character. Alia is also wonderful. Her face has the right combination of innocence, chirpiness, traditional, bindass attitude. She makes Kavya so much lovable. Sidharth as Angad Bedi has great screen presence. I just wish, Sidharth's role could have been a bit longer and his vanishing from the last frames could have been given different treatment. Both Sahil Vaid and Gaurav Pandey as Humpty's friends and Kenny Desai as Humpty's father are all adorable, excellent performances from them. Rest of the cast are also good. Music could have been better. The song 'Samjhawan' composed by Toshi- Sharib and sung by Shreya-Arijit is very good.",negative
Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania,I just created an account now in IMDb just to write a review about this crap that I watched few hours ago. I cannot believe people are rating up to 3 stars out of 5 and 6.1 rating!!! I just wish there was zero or negative in the vote!If you are a big DDLJ-SRK fan please stay away! I think these people have lost their mind and they think people who watch movies are stupid and mean enough to like an awful story like this. Have this director ever watched DDLJ??? I personally feel that this is perfectly crafted to mock and insult the lovely performance of SRK and Kajol in DDLJ!!! Boy I wish they would never watch this pathetic movie. I have no idea why Karan Johar would agree upon something like this. The way modern Indian culture depicted in this movie is so condemnable. Please don't watch this movie guys or you will want to slap the director and the actors for choosing this script. 'Normal Human beings' will definitely hate this movie. May be they should try showing this movie to Zombies so that they could eat these peoples brains and just kill them right away!,positive
Prem Ratan Dhan Payo,"This movie is one of the worst and most boring movies. They are so many songs which don't add anything to the narrative. This movie director Soraj Barjatya used to make hit movies in 1980s and 1990s is still living there and his craft has only gone worse as time has gone. This review contains spoilers , This movie is a story of a prince played by Salman who is having trouble in maintaining relationships with his family members. Due to a crooked CEO played by Armaan Kohli who always makes schemes to create division among the two brothers , young brother played by Neil Nitin Mukesh. Salman also has problems with his sister(Swara Bhaskar) and this takes toll on his relationship with his finacee (Sonam Kapoor). There is a plot to kill the prince , and how prince look alike Prem(Salman Khan) helps in saving the prince and unite the family forms the rest of the movie. The music is bad and lyrics are the worst ever in Bollywood. Waste of 2 hours 30 minutes of your life if u watch this movie.",negative
Prem Ratan Dhan Payo,"I almost didn't watch this movie due to the repetitive negative reviews here on IMDb. Usually I find reviews here fairly spot-on. But in this case I am convinced we are living in a generation of viewers who have been raised on so much schlock, sex, violence, blood and foul language that they wouldn't recognize a prime movie if it whacked them with a hammer. Either that or we have a set of the most bogus witch-hunt reviews ever. I could count the number of films I would give 10 stars and still have some toes left. This film has everything-- terrific cinematography, good acting (yes, a little hokey in places: intentionally so), a script that if one has a heart at all should bring tears to the eyes repeatedly, humorous moments, fun moments, bad decisions, sacrifice, redemption, hundreds of supporting actors, the most incredibly huge set I have ever seen in any film (they built an entire palace!) -- as well as the full gamut of drama mixed with comedy, music and dance.Many others have discussed the merits of the movie itself; they have done well enough that I don't have to re-hash. What I will focus on is the incredible number of negative reviews present here. We notice a large number of the reviews are similar or identical in writing style. That stands out very clearly-- which is highly suspect. Secondly, a large number of those reviews claim to be written from differing cities in India, yet are all in perfect, pristine English. ""Most boring movie I've ever seen."" We see this phrase repeatedly, in almost identical words. There are too many people giving this 7+ stars and even 10 stars (unusual to see on IMDb) to believe the legitimacy of the number of 1-star ""worst movie ever"" reviews. Such paradox is simply difficult to accept as valid. All I know is I'm in the U.S., I and my sister watched the movie together, and we both loved it. I can be very critical of films and for sure I have seen some real stinkers in my day-- but this movie definitely is not one of them. This has song, dance, a delightful story... and touches the heart more than once. Have your hanky ready. Please, feel free to consider the negative reviews as suspect (at the very least)-- and give this film a try. The best and most valid review is your own.",positive
Hasee Toh Phasee,Though i get what style this film was going for but the director lost sight of the theme. Though I get the rules he was trying to break...he wasn't consistently breaking them. Also the whole manic pixie dream character was so irritating and poorly directed. She had no real depth to her character and every time she bit her lip to display her quirkyness or whatever I straight up wanted to punch her in the face. I can't believe how annoying her character was and straight up not believable but a caricature. This seems like a big budget film so frikin do better.,negative
Hasee Toh Phasee,"Before I get on with the review, let me tell you I'm not a hardcore Parineeti fan. Just like I'm not Kareena's fan even though Jab We Met is in my top 5 list. I went in to watch Hasee to Phasee casually without any expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised. I found the movie to be superb! From a critics point of view, this movie has nothing new to offer. In fact, you can complain about many things. But this is one movie, where I beg to differ with the critics. Even though I have seen such movies plenty of times, I couldn't help myself from loving Parineeti's character. And needless to say, nobody but Parineeti could have brought the character to life.Aggressive, Submissive and Whacky! Parineeti's character Meeta has so many shades, you couldn't tell what she'd do next. The only thing I didn't like was : hero falling head over heals for a girl he met just a week back. Maybe they could have given more time for their relation to mature. But that doesn't stop me from LOVING each and every bit of the movie. Like the sequence where the heroine casually asks her sister's fiancé to marry her. Or, the ""locked in the room"" sequence where Parineeti gives an excellent performance.I couldn't give much credit to Adah Sharma for acting. Having said that, she is also extremely gorgeous. I'd definitely like to see her in more movies. Chemistry between the lead actors is quite sparkling, and I was quite satisfied with how the things turned out.I'll be heading to the theater soon to watch this movie again. This movie is definitely going to be in my Top 10 list.",positive
Dum Laga Ke Haisha,"Prem (Ayushmann Khurrana) is persuaded by his family to marry for financial reasons to an overweight woman he doesn't find attractive. His new wife, Sandhya (Bhumi Pednekar ) is an educated woman who tries to make her marriage work, but Prem has no interest in so doing. They are persuaded to take part in the ""Dum Lagao"" contest, where the husband carries his wife on his back through an obstacle course, in so doing they reconcile.The premise of this movie is fantastic, but it just doesn't deliver. There is very little character development, less happiness, and an ending that is too sudden and not credible. Khurrana, who is too old for the role, wears a scowl the entire movie and plays his part one- dimensionally. Pednekar, in her first movie, is fantastic, giving depth to Sandhya, portraying believable emotions, and acting nearly flawlessly. Her performance is so good that she nearly saves the movie, but not quite.",negative
Dum Laga Ke Haisha,"DLKH brings the much needed freshness in Bollywood romance movies. And it comes with a very strong message woven around a very sweet love story. The direction is impeccable with moderated melodrama. Ayushmann Khurrana might never get the stardom like the Khans and the Kapoors but he is definitely one of those actors never afraid of doing path breaking movies and top them up with amazing natural acting - be it comedy or drama. But he gets a good competition from the new girl Bhumi Padnekar who delivers a very good performance, depicting a struggle of a fat girl in a white skin - size zero obsessed society of India. Sanjay Mishra, playing the role of Ayushmann's father, gives a memorable performance with really good dialog delivery topped up with brilliant comic timing. The length of the movie is unusually short for a Bollywood movie but then quality is always more important than quantity. Overall, for someone in a mood to watch a light romantic movie, your search ends at DLKH. This movie comes easily into the list of ""movies I can watch anytime"".",positive
2 States,"As a person brought up in a family with 2 states culture IRL this is just a cheap mockery of exaggerated stereotypes in a loud nonsensical lengthy Bollywood movie. Could not even get through the book but was hopeful at least the movie would do justice to the best kind of love stories in India. The real life issues of reactions of different family members, difference in opinions, some compromises in traditional value, concerns of extended family and how they come about to achieve a middle ground none of which was depicted in a proper way. It was borderline racist sometimes without being apologetic even when there was absolutely no requirement for scenes like that. And no, that never increased the humor quotient of the movie which was already as low as their standards. To summarize, it was as if a Hollywood romcom was made about interracial marriages where the family of the whites gifts fired chicken to the blacks and the blacks would get them all some guns as gifts because they are from Texas.",negative
2 States,"We all are quite familiar with movies which are based on novels, real- life stories, autobiographies etc. but few films exist which strikes the right chord! Many movies (in Bollywood) like 3 Idiots (2009), Kai Po Che (2013) have been adapted from novels of one masterpiece: Chetan Bhagat! He is the main reason behind the success of these movies and many others and again for the latest release of his novel ""2 States"" adaptation in Bollywood!! This movie is so wonderful and doesn't require any action scenes, over-the-top dialogues, old-typical themes etc. but the makers have given a remarkable effort with some minor changes as compared to the book!! So here we go:Story: The story is beautifully crafted!! 2 people of different culture, different states fall in love with each other. But whether they know the consequences they would face when they would face the discomfort and the pressures when people talk of inter-caste liaison, the unyielding love and the resolve to win the parents' trust, each and every aspect with the emotions included! Will they succeed in convincing their parents to get married or will their relationship would get over is the main plot of this film.Cast: Arjun Kapoor as Krish Malhotra is delightful!! After films like Ishaqzaade (2012) and Gunday (2014) where he has a goofy character, he truly succeeds in playing a sweet, simple kind of a guy who gives importance to his relationships! He charms and gives a meticulous performance! One of his finest performance till date!Alia Bhatt as Ananya Subramanium is first-rate!! She is beautiful yet witty and gives a delightful performance as a Tamil-Brahmin girl!! Her chemistry with Arjun is electrifying! We can say that Alia has now became an evolved actress and she knows when to capture emotions at the right time!!Amrita Singh as Krish's Mother is a revelation! She truly is fantastic as the typical Punjabi mother-in-law who justifies her role!! She steals the show in most of the scenes!!Ronit Roy as Krish's Father is extraordinary!! He develops an antagonistic relationship with his son but he is remarkable!! Watch out for the twist that he would get in the 2nd half!Shiv Subramanium and Revathy as Ananya's Father and Mother gives decent performances!! They are quite efficient!!Direction: Director Abhishek Varman should deserve the Best Debut Director in next year's film awards! He truly strikes the right chord!! He gives an remarkable effort but capturing sweet melodramatic scenes and wonderful emotions which come during the course of the film!! Both he and Karan Johar (Producer) have wonderfully executed a delightful film!!Music: The music of the film is exceedingly well!! The songs truly move you and will put a smile in your face!! Songs like ""Locha-e-Ulfat"" and ""Offo"" are best numbers which will make you groove along with it! ""Mann Mast Magan"" is a wonderful and top-notch song that steals your heart!!On the whole, 2 States is one of those rare Hindi films which have came in a long time and had explored us the diverse cultures, melodramatic scenes, problems of inter-caste marriages but one thing knocks all of it: ""Love""! It really empowers on all of the dizzy situations!! Strongly recommended to people of all age-groups and also to those who fantasize about diverse people!!",positive

OXV: The Manual,"I saw the world premiere at Fantasia and chatted at length with writer/director/editor/producer Darren Paul Fisher afterwards.The Universe he created and that the viewer slowly discovers is complex, coherent, intriguing and raise ethical and philosophical questions including the classic determinism versus free will dilemma. The arguments and points of view are quite interesting, with a caveat that in the end, perhaps who cares? There is a love story in the midst (and a friendship) that builds and begs to reach you emotionally with fine acting and directing. Character development arise seamlessly through three different age period and the pacing and editing are quite remarkably on cue.I don't want to reveal too much about this cerebral science fiction, but there are many clever surprises that awaits the engaged viewer both in the story twists and the underlying concepts explored. Even love has some deep philosophical implications at one point in the context of the film.So there you have it: the best film of Fantasia so far this year and one of the best sci-fi ever, from the spectacular script to the screen.Bravo Mr Fisher and thank you for sharing your thoughts and labour of love in this artistic and philosophical masterpiece.",positive

Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2,"LoL the majority of average rating is coming from the feminist side i assume :D Well definitely the movie will give you a burst of laughter if you're a male and we were expecting exactly the same, the movie live to the hype of the PKPN1. In beginning i wasn't expecting it to stand any where near to its prequel but i'm glad that i was wrong.Though Thakur couldn't gel up as a replacement for Chaudhary, i personally feel the boys cast should be the same... missed the bonding of Rajjo, Liquid and Chaudhary but Chouka takes that place as a nice replacement package. Its a story that revolves around women's 1. the money minded.. 2. the best friend conscious.. and 3. girl concerned with family... the movie scenes were well shot and Anshul/Gogo monologue is longer, better and epic.I will agree to the fact that First half is more fun and dominant over the second but the story ends really well Talking to their mothers;)Don't listen to any1, if u r a fan of first PKPN you will definitely enjoy this movie without any disappointment, cheers!!",positive
Premam,"Yes yes Nivin Pauly has acted well but more than that it was the director's vision which gave this movie its heart. The storyline is nothing new - a young carefree lad George falls in love for the first time and many times thereafter and how his outlook of the world changes with each lady love of his life. Alphonse Puthren gave a new life to the script with his impeccable cinematography and detailing. Each and every role is etched perfectly and acted with excellence. The roles played by the support actors as George's best friends tingle your heart because when their friend is heartbroken they cry with him too. After a very long time has a movie come where the emphasis is not on the family drama but on the adopted family that we get as our friends. The background score of the movie is excellent keeping up with the tempo of the movie frames. Though I felt there were a couple of unwanted scenes here and there but whole and whole it was a good entertainer. P.S.- Nivin Pauly looks stunning in that black shirt, mundu and those aviators..!! *sigh*",negative
Premam,"""What a way to refresh yourself.."" This is what came to my mind after watching this film. Being a great fan of the mastermind Alphonse Puthren and his debut film Neram, this didn't disappoint me. But it did impress me.It may not be a life-changing, mind-blowing film. But a clean romantic comedy that lies closer to reality than you think. Unintentional and situational comedy that shows up almost in every scene of the film, can clean your mind of any stress or anything of that sort that you have at the moment.The direction of the film as usual is exemplary. The edits (that too done by the director) certainly utilities the factor of directorial edited films. The film certainly lacks a story but that factor is hidden by the beautifully captured visuals thanks to the cinematographer, Anend. Screenplay is good. Production value and art was natural at it's level best as most of the places shown in the film originally exists.The film is divided into 3 acts that covers 3 stages of the life of George, a care-free living youngster - the first one covering the romantic relationship of George while studying in 12th grade is the shortest one of the film. The second covering his collage life is the longest and the most stylish\epic one among that, making it my favorite. The last act shows the life of George after his collage life, now a working class fellow. The film's main plot is based on 3 different women that George fell in love with during the 3 different stages.Simple and elegant plot which lags a bit in the last half hour is the only problem with the film that I saw.Positives :-1. Nivin Pauly himself is a great asset to the film. The film too should be a great asset to him as this film is the best work I saw from him. He has improved his weaknesses like acting out emotional scenes and dance. OMG, the wonderful dance choreographed by Sai Pallavi is amazing. And Nivin has danced it to perfection.2. All other male stars. When I say this I mainly mean none others that Krishna Sankar and Shabareesh Varma. Shabareesh does a kind of one man show which is my other favorite of the film. Being a lyricist and a singer, the actor have given all his level best performance at all areas. Vinay fort, Maniyanpilla Raju was also good. 3. All the three lead actresses were pretty good. Mostly Sai Pallavi who changed the entire course of the film with her cute performance as Malar miss smile emoticon4. Wonderful cameos. There are a lot of cameos throughout. First one being Jude Anthony as Jolly D' Cruz. Then there is Renji Panicker as David who did a stylish role with the superbly written dialogs from his own films. Finally there is the director himself as Ronnie who is a drug addict and the only or mainly the villain of the film.5. Superb stunt scenes. There is hardly 2 scenes of fights in the entire film and the main one in that being George's collage intro. I sure wished there was more of that frown emoticon6. Amazing cinematography and superb Edits.7. The best soundtrack I've ever heard along with Chandrettan Evideya and Neram.Negatives :-1. A little lag that happens the final half hour.Verdict - Premam is a surely must watch entertainer",positive
Tanu Weds Manu Returns,"Killed all the goodwill created by original Tanu weds Manu.Killed romance, killed innocence sweetness and respectful relationships. Madhavan character goes from shy handsome NRI boy to confused perverted prick running behind teenage girls. Kangana character goes from liberal revolting teenager coming to her senses eventually, to a drinking slut who has affairs with everyone from rickshaw walla to a brotherly relative. She puts her husband in mental asylum, goes on a hawas trip to find suitable match for herself while still married. Jassi turns from a gabru sardar to impotent wimp, payal from a sensible UP girl to evil housewife who hides from her husband that he is not really father of their baby.And wine and alcohol industries must have paid serious money to production house becoz they are promoting drinking like anything. Everybody is drinking in every scene of the movie. Watch out for your urges and your liver! 3 stars for datto's character and all the laughs.",negative
Tanu Weds Manu Returns,".....after you have been mentally slaughtered on an over-hyped film like Bombay Velvet the week before, TWMR is a breath of fresh air. Excellent script, great direction and wonderful performances make this a must-watch romantic-comedy.The attention to detail in character design, setup and dialects is worth mentioning. Even if you haven't watched the prequel, it stands on it's own right and leaves you with a feel good happy feel. It slightly loses it's grip somewhere close to the climax, but that aside, it's brilliant. Go and enjoy!",positive
Ocho apellidos vascos,"Utter Tosh. A highly predictable dirge of a film taking stereotypical characters (lazy but cheerful Andalusians, defensive nationalistic Basques) and then placing them in situations to which you know exactly how it is going to finish. The comedy is supposed to be slapstick and an ironic look at the two distinct areas of Spain but it quickly becomes tedious and in places offensive. It's repetitive (proud Basque father, intimidated daughter, happy go lucky Sevillian) and would be fine as a five minute sketch. Despite this being one of the highest grossing films in Spanish Cinema, many Spanish friends of mine have also commented how ""simple"" and childish the comedy is. A case of the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" as there is nothing really here. Truly truly horrible.",negative

Casse-tête chinois,"The threequel to 'Pot Luck' and 'Russian Dolls', 'Chinese Puzzle' picks up the story of French writer Xavier (Romain Duris, engaging as ever). He's now married to Briton Wendy (Kelly Reilly), with whom he has two children. His Belgian lesbian chum Isabelle (Cécile De France) is obsessing about having children and Xavier agrees, against Wendy's wishes, to provide the sperm with which Isabelle will be artificially inseminated (who said romance was dead?) Meanwhile, Wendy meets an American and sets up home with him in New York, taking her and Xavier's children with her. Distraught at losing contact with the children, Xavier relocates to New York himself. But will he ever find lasting love?There are many things casually presented as acceptable here which some may take issue with (eg the self-indulgent, artificial creation of children in a time of over-population; visa-convenient marriages). But this film is so feel-good that even a grouch like me sat grinning - or laughing out loud - for much of it. Returning players Duris, De France and Audrey Tautou slip on their former roles with ease; Reilly's acting I found a bit too soap operaish. Of the new characters, Jason Kravits, as Duris' sleazy lawyer, does a fine comic turn. The film is pure entertainment - in fact, if it weren't for Xavier and Wendy's annoyingly precocious, wise-beyond-his-years son, it would be near perfect. But this is still another splendid chapter in Cédric Klapisch's romcom saga.",negative
Casse-tête chinois,"I haven't seen the two previous movies by the same director and actors preceding this one, but all by itself I loved this one. It is funny, witty, interesting and unusual. I understand the previous two movies portrayed the lives of characters at an earlier age. Now they are around 40 years of age, they are in NYC and they have different set of problems. I participated in a Q&A with the director at the end of the movie and I understand what he is trying to portray is a generation of people who are more mobile, who aren't afraid of mixing with different cultures, live in different countries, deal with the challenges presented by this new country. Movie has a very very positive, upbeat look at things. And it is very refreshing to have this positive outlook considering how many movies feeds of drama and difficulties almost to a degree, which makes them unrealistic. Life is not so bad and things don't go that bad in real life. You might get lucky at things. This movie has a positive, realistic look at life. I could easily relate to it. Loved it, highly recommend it. Especially if you want to laugh a bit and feel good about life. And there is nothing wrong with that.",positive
Samba,"This movie about the trials of Samba, a Senegalese illegal immigrant's life in Paris is from the director and lead actor Omar Sy that brought us The Intouchables, and suffers from revisiting the fish out of water relationships that underpinned that earlier film less convincingly. I just couldn't swallow the attraction that brought Alice, a burned out recruitment executive and Samba together, and most of the other central characters such as Wilson (Tahar Rahim) were superficial or unbelievable. The best aspect was raising the issue of how western societies treat refugees and illegal migrants. But overall it lurched between slapstick and serious without the glue of characters one cared about to hold it together.",negative
Samba,"As some have noted before, it is a light-hearted movie on a serious topic (undocumented immigrants) but always respectful at that.I cannot quite agree with the reviewers that did not see the humor in this movie (I laughed about every three minutes throughout - expect towards the end - and sometimes even cried at the same time). Neither can I understand how people can say that the characters are flat or even ""boring"". Imho, the film succeeds in portraying them in not just black and white; each of them (and there are many!) evolves within the 120 minutes so much so that, in fact, it is not about the immigrants being the ""angels"" and the immigrant officers being the ""devils"" at all. On the contrary, lines are blurred very early on and especially in the end.I find that this is a worth successor of ""Untouchables""; I probably even prefer it. It is a very moving film (similar to the documentary ""l'Escale"") but without trying to be so. Also, the actors are brilliant! (Omar Sy, I think, even manages to mimic a Senegalese accent.)",positive
Bana Masal Anlatma,"We know the director and writer of 'Bana Masal Anlatma' since 'Leyla and Mecnun' which was the most popular comedy in Turkey, actually still it is. The man who I am talking about is Burak Aksak. It is widely accepted, everyone who watched Leyla and Mecnun, including me, want to watch a film is produced by Burak Aksak. This is his first movie. Pretty successful but the film has lots of mistakes in it. According to me, whole mistakes are acceptable because the director and the movie reach one's goal that is amusing us. If you do not care details of the film, you would have fun. Nonetheless, I would like to talk about the biggest one.The love between Jilet (Gürkan Uygur) and Neriman (Gökçe Bahadır)... We do not know what happened before everything, also we cannot imagine what happen next.On the other hand, It was so ironic that Cengiz Bozkurt is playing a character who is stingy. This was ironic due to he played similar role in Leyla and Mecnun.In addition, all witticisms are staying away from swearing and bad words. Therefore, we can see creativity of the writer who is Burak Aksak.Finally, If you want to laugh and miss Leyla and Mecnun go to the cinema and watch ""Bana Masal Anlatma"". You would not regret but like I said, do not mind about details.",negative
Bana Masal Anlatma,"Technically flawless, perfectly natural, and hilariously funny.Writer&director Burak Aksak put an extraordinary performance, similar to his previous works like Leyla ile Mecnun and Ben de Özledim. The story is very natural and warmhearted. The change of people, cities, and life itself is portrayed in a both sentimental and amusing way.Acting, directorial technique, screenplay and music score are on a very high level. The actors credit include both young and talented actors beside very experienced and master actors in Turkish Cinema.As a person whose life mostly is based on dramatic events, this movie made me burst into tears with amazingly funny and extremely emotional scenes. I can definitely recommend to go and see this movie with ease, you won't regret.",positive
Love Is Strange,"A disappointment. It seemed the movie was made to self-serve the director's own agenda. I'm not saying the questions of gay marriage and its associated life difficulties are not of social importance - in fact, quite the opposite - but presenting it in such a trivial and obvious manner bordering boredom is useless. A storyline of ordinary lives evolving around other ordinary lives all immersed in ordinary circumstances - what new did the movie tell us? Nothing, really. The ""strange"" love story is indeed a very common denominator nowadays. There are gays, there is love, there are difficulties associated with economic, financial and social status - we all know that. Semi-random scenes put together to make a semi-random story lacking fluidity but being generous to slowness is what we actually see. If you want to make a point, make it in a beautiful, artistic way that will leave viewers with internal satisfaction or mental stimulation or visual inspiration. Rather, we see a movie that wants to scream ""Look, life is hard for us gay people, we are misunderstood, we are victims!"" and everything artificially revolves around and is build upon such an attention-seeking statement. The involvement of other characters to justify social diversity and ubiquitousness of personal feelings expressed in different age stages of life cannot hide the foundational personal agenda of victimization. Obviously, old men in love is a powerful and touching subject that attracts empathy, but there is no need to use it as tool in your own belt to overcome your own insecurities and promote cliché life stories. Because that's how it felt like from the beginning until the end of the movie. Actors did a good job. In fact, this was the only good thing in the movie. Such a waste of their talent. Elongated, mundane scenes tried to provoke some kind of emotions, but were rather completely detached in terms of coherency. I'd ask many of the supporting actors - do you know what the purpose of your character in the movie was?This could have been an orders of magnitude better movie. Basically, if you have heard what Mr Wonderful from Sharks Tank used to say - ""Life is hard, and then you die"" - then you know pretty much everything about this movie. The only remaining question is ""Why?"". Unfortunately, the movie does not attempt to answer it.",negative
Love Is Strange,"LOVE IS STRANGE, a film, unaffectedly directed by Ira Sachs, is so natural and unassuming in its portrayal of relationships that the divide between audience and the characters on the screen disappears; we are directly slipping into their lives with the ease of familiarity. There is a formal beauty to the movie, thanks to the cinematography of Christos Voudouris - the way he captures each space - delineated not only through décor, but through the light which mutates with the atmosphere, very much like a Chardin still-life painting, classic in its grandeur and silence.The plot revolves around two gay men who have lived together for 39 years and finally get married, a decision that will alter their lives in ways that are unexpected and transforming. We first meet Ben, a seventy-one year old artist, (John Lithgow in a breathtaking performance) and his partner George (Alfred Molina in an equally fine portrayal,) a music teacher in a Catholic school - both excitedly, and nervously preparing for the ceremony and the post- wedding party. From the moment we first view Lithgow and Molina singing a duet together - their voices and theatrics in synch and at odds - tender intimacy is apparent. Ira Sachs and co-writer Mauricio Zacharias have created two remarkably gentle and loving individuals, their intimacy and enduring connection, is both understated and powerfully passionate.The consequences of ultimately legitimizing their union bear witness to the harsh realities that accompany that choice. Soon after the nuptials, George gets fired from his job, and the economic demands of existing in NYC, forced to sell the apartment in order to find more affordable housing, interrupts their former cadence of living. Having no alternative, George and Ben, temporarily separate to move in with friends and relatives till they can find a home of their own. Molina and Lithgow stunningly convey the anguish of living apart and the intense longing of being united again. It is as if one person is sliced in half – going through the motions, but not fully functioning without the other.LOVE IS STRANGE also references the mysterious corridor of generational diversity - both fractious and enriching. The anxious, rebellious teenager slowly embracing life's uncertainties embodied by Joey, Ben's great-nephew in an excellent performance by Charlie Tahan who is likable, secretive and obnoxious – an eternal artifact of an adolescent's growing awareness of life's promises and aching discomforts. And approaching mid-life, are his parents - Kate (Marisa Tomei - a natural wonder) - a writer trying to meet the demands of motherhood and still do her own work and Elliot (Darren E. Burrows) a father too wrapped up in doing business (supporting the family?) to notice the splintering family dynamic. Tomei's facial expressions convey a woman's inner tug-of-war between being a caregiver and accomplishing her own ambitions, shifting from haggardly frustrated to a luminous empathy, particularly for the growing pains of her son on the cusp of adulthood.Director Ira Sachs has given us a tone poem to the beauty, delight and fragility of living in a city - New York - dynamic, diverse and constantly changing, echoing the vicissitudes of life as we stumble through our own personal unfolding. A love story that has depth and endurance - delicate and supple, both romantic and mundane, LOVE IS STRANGE is wrenchingly lovely and generous, but also a reminder that nothing is permanent.",positive
The Meddler,"The movie starts in an Apple Store where Susan Sarandon buy a new Iphone. She explains that the 64GB model is better than the 16GB one. After few minutes she is at a pre maman party, and gift the new mother with an iPad. She explains that it's a very good gadget, that you can install things on it, and the young mother wows very loud at the tablet. Next scene we are on an Apple store, where we can see the ""genius"" explaining to her how to zoom in and out. At the 15 minutes mark we are at her daughter's house, and on the bed we can see a Macbook.

The Meddler,"Characters like Marnie, the role played by Susan Sarandon in this film, I find really hard to tolerate. In fact I wasn't going to watch the film but decided to only because I knew Sarandon would elevate it. And now, having read some of the reviews here, I realize how comparable it was to Sally Field's recent film, My Name is Doris.What these two films share in common, besides being made watchable thanks to the talents of their respective main star, is that they were character portrayals of the aging baby boomer as a childlike character.As an aging baby boomer female myself, I found myself asking, with both films, but I'll stick to The Meddler here, did Marnie take too many drugs in her youth? Because there's something so innocent, spaced out, cutesy, and ultimately kind of brain dead, about her.Reviewers have referred to her as happy, cheerful, smiling, caring, etc. which are all accurate, but when I ask myself, is she someone I'd like to spend time with, or even have as my mother, my answer is a resounding No. Maybe because in my own family I was the ""adult child"" I think I'd have to assume that role with Marnie, too. Because frankly she fits into la la land so perfectly. And I always feel that characters/people like that are able to get away with something that I can't. Which is all to say watching The Meddler was a mixed experience.",positive

One very well known and experienced and two young and talented. A friendship that is bond with life and death. It should be really hard to capture it all but Yilmaz Erdogan did a great job as a director and actor.

Copenhagen,"The problem with this movie is the main character. He becomes very hard to watch after 20 minutes or so as he apparently has no redeeming qualities. I don't mind an unlikeable character at all, in the hands of a great director and a great actor, but Will just grates on the nerves. For the whole movie.
If the script had gone through two or three more re-writes, they might have had something here. But aside from an interesting performance from Frederikke Dahl Hansen, (a 20 year old actress playing a 14 year old character)....this movie just has nothing to offer. It just kinds of meanders until its very predictable, very unsatisfying conclusion.",negative
Copenhagen,"***warning, possible spoilers*** this movie should be studied in film classes: you watch it, enjoy it, but don't really realize the effectiveness of the writer and director until later. Here is what happens: 1. An analogy best explains this film: we have all probably seen a video of a master with his dog. Sitting in front of the dog is the most delectable treat imaginable to the dog. The dog does nothing even though every fiber of its being wants to gobble up that treat. It is waiting for its masters command. The Masters here are the writer and director, the dog is the male lead. The girl is the treat (and not in a prurient sense). She says she will be 15 (the age of consent) ""in a few days"". He wants to pounce (But not in a sexual sense even though there is obvious physical attraction). 2. The age difference is not for shock value. It is a very effective plot device relating to 1 above. 3. They are alone in a hotel room, both drunk (largely at his insistence). She is the aggressor. The reality is he cannot believe she is only 14 and repeatedly says that throughout the movie. She tries to seduce him, taking off her blouse and kissing him which he appears to accept. 4. The ""masters"" do not outright state that they did not sleep together but instead, more effectively, make that clear by: they both wake up in bed fully clothed (she must have put her top back on) in sharp contrast to his other many dalliances where he graphically wakes up with a naked partner; just prior to this he turns down an offer that most males his age dream about – two beautiful drunk girls try to drag him back to their hotel for a threesome. Instead of going with the women, he is much more concerned about having hurt the girl's feelings and rushes out of the bar, leaving the women, to try to call the girl and apologize for acting like a jerk. So, the attraction is not about sex per se. there is much more to his feelings for the girl and he is clearly conflicted. He does not sleep with her.5. There is more to him than meets the eye: he is in Denmark to find his grandfather and understand why he was abandoned by his father. The girl, with a great heart and overlooking the fact that he is superficially an insensitive jerk sees something deeper in him and embraces the cause of him finding his past and takes it upon herself to help him. 6. The girl, is far more substantial and mature than the women he has been sleeping with (who is really older, the girl or his earlier partners?). She too, has a troubled family but is very close to her mother and wants to help him resolve that part of his life. 7. In one effective scene, he simply glances down a street and sees a father briefly interacting with his son (short and effective). 8. The most effective scene in the movie: she takes him to a museum. She brings him to a dark corner where there is a bust. She tells him she has never brought anyone there before. She stands next to the bust. It is an exact image of the girl. She tells him she is really hundreds of years old and he says the bust is 1500 years old. This scene is a metaphor for what the movie accomplishes. After 1500 years, here she (who posed for the bust) is here again, resurrected, with the human traits that allowed us to survive over those 1500 years: the yearning for family, love, and a striving for happiness even in an imperfect world. In other hands this might seem corny, here it is movie-making genius.",positive
Highway,"Highway (Review) – After 'Rockstar', director Imtiaz Ali is now back with his latest road movie 'Highway' starring Randeep Hooda and Alia Bhatt in the lead. Even though there wasn't as much hype, the movie had created a healthy buzz. 'Highway' begins with Veera Tripathi played by Alia Bhatt being kidnapped while she is on a highway with her fiancé by a group of gangsters and one of them being Mahabir Bhati played by Randeep Hooda. Veera is kidnapped by Mahabir Bhati and his gang as she has witnessed a roadside shootout at a petrol pump by the gang. Veera is the daughter of a VIP in Delhi and the gang is unaware of it and when they get to know about it, they continue keeping her in custody trying to blackmail Veera's family for ransom. Veera who is initially traumatised by the whole saga slowly gets used to being with the gang and starts enjoying her time with them as she would never have had that much freedom back home. Veera once describes the entire trauma that she underwent as a child in her family to Mahabir after which he starts to be a bit more considerate towards her. Mahabir and his gang alongwith Veera keep travelling from one place to another all over India. Meanwhile the search for Veera is on in full swing back in Delhi. This forms the first half of the movie. What happens to Veera? Will she finally be back with her family, is to be watched in what is the best part of the movie, the beautiful and an engaging second half. The best technical aspect of the film is the cinematography as the highways and the mountains and the streams in Himachal Pradesh are captured beautifully. Performance of Alia Bhatt might seem like a shadow of Kareena Kapoor in 'Jab We Met' for the first 5 minutes but later enters into her own zone and has performed brilliantly in a couple of scenes. Randeep Hooda plays the tough guy throughout the movie and also a man showing his emotions when reminded of his mother very well. Music by the maestro A.R. Rahman is also worth appreciating as a couple of tracks like Patakha Guddi, Sooha Sooha and Maahi Ve stand out. Rahman leaves his stamp in Maahi Ve especially. Oscar winner Resul Pookutty has done a brilliant job in sound design as well. Imtiaz Ali has done a commendable job in making this movie and presenting the way it should be without adding unnecessary junk. Movies of this kind need to be promoted and encouraged as they form a perfect bridge between class and mass films thereby paving the way for other filmmakers to make similar attempts. Watch 'Highway' for its authenticity, ethnicity, brilliant camera-work and a beautiful second half. My verdict – 8/10",negative
Highway,"Let me start by saying that this movie has everything right about it. From direction and cinematography to performances and music. The locations are breath taking.Imtiaz Ali yet again delivers a ""hat ke"" love story. Its not exactly a love story but a tale of two people who want to get free and experience life. Both the characters have there own painful pasts and when they come together they let it all go and try to start it all over again.Their journey is the theme of this movie. Alaya Bhatt and Randeep Hooda deliver power packed performances with a great supporting cast.The movie forces us to think about the society we live in and how people struggle to lead a normal life. Be it a rich family or a poor villager. They have there own challenges.I won't go more into the story line as that is something to be experienced.This movie comes with a message and we are left to think what freedom and liberation means.I will strongly recommend this one.",positive

In addition, none of the classic Müslüm Gürses songs are included in this film. All acting in the first part of his childhood and Zerrin Tekindor can be viewed for.",negative

Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela,"what a pathetic portrayal of an age old story. the movie rides on Deepika Padukone's skin show with excessive use of colour which could irritate one to the core.There is nothing in the movie which could keep the viewer hooked. Abhimanyu singh's talent is totally wasted, wish he had got more screen time. I personally like movies with violence, but Raam-leela is full of mindless, stupid violence. Must say that violence is not Bhansalis cup of tea.When everything was seen falling apart, there came the final nail in the coffin, Priyankas awful item number. Ranveer is okay, after all the hype much more was expected from him. The only saving grace of the film is Supriya Pathak who pulls off a difficult character with panache.",negative
Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela,"Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, one of the most anticipated movies of the year releases with all its bang and reveals itself as least related to stuff for which it had been declared controversial.Sanjay Leela Bhansali's take on Romeo-Juliet, despite a known script, seems quite refreshing. The visuals, nobody questions, is by far Bhansali's best. Utterly flawless. You might want to compare the flawed VFX effects of movies like Krrish 3 and Ra. One and find Ram-Leela's visuals standing far ahead of them. The symmetry he puts in, the pattern he develops in every visual is like the best artist would.SLB's poetry, dialogs and expression are so well that you might want other directors to get training from him. The professionalism is of Hollywood standard.The songs are already chart-topping (Nagade Sang Dhol was No.1 on i Tunes for 7 consequent weeks), and when you watch them in the movie you feel mesmerized. So well choreographed are these dances that you couldn't stop yourself from thinking of performing them on some occasion. Though a bit raunchy, Ishkiyaon Dhishkyon seems more funny than vulgar. Priyanka's item number gives mph effect.The strongest part of Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela is the star performances. We do not doubt that Deepika Padukone, who has established herself as an equal of the Vidya Balan and Shaban Azmi only betters herself with this movie, giving her critics a yet bigger challenge. She, as Leela, is flawless. You wouldn't be watching Deepika Padukone, but Leela in the movie. Though in Cocktail, Ye Jawaani ha Deewani and Chennai Express, Deepika was the soul of the movie, here she has to share it with Ranveer Singh who acts equally well. This is his best performance so far. In fact, this is the best performance of the year by a male actor. Richa Chada is shockingly real as Leela's sister-in-law and Supriya Pathak, though sounds a bit like Hansa, is exhilarating and fear-inducing. Every dialog she delivers is pitch perfect.The perfection that Bhansali has expressed in all the aforementioned topics gets polluted by the flawed script. Though in the first half you do not notice how time passes with the songs, acting and the chemistry setting fire to the screen, the second half takes a U-turn. The second half begins with impracticality, which moves on to deal with various serious topics, which is exceptional to a love story. What becomes a problem here is the absence of effective execution of these scenes. The sub-plots are in abundance but all last for so less time that the tears of Leela and Ram do not reflect on the audience's eyes. Before the audience could feel the pain, the scene changes. The ending becomes more like a fairy tale which ruins all the realistic happenings of the movie.Despite its flaw, Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela stands as WORTH WATCHING. One must definitely watch this class-and-mass movie for entertainment, visuals, star performances, songs, and by far the best adaptation of Romeo and Juliet by Bollywood. Go fall in love with Ram-Leela!",positive
Arjun Reddy,"The emotions in the love story are nothing more than kissing, and the word ""baby"". The protagonist always has some philosophy to cover up for the situation to prove that he is correct. The father/brother emotions are not sufficiently built. It would have been good if the brother characterization was built better, as to how he attempts to save his brother, or how the family would free him from drug addiction through showing of love. Overall, more of a story that dives deeper and deeper into tragedy. The boy is shown to be an excellent doctor. Even to excel in profession/academics, I believe a person would need to have a lot better self-control than what the protagonist seems to possess.",negative
Arjun Reddy,"It has been a refreshing experience watching this movie. The romance, characterization is at its raw best. I am glad that the director and his team did not do anything to dial it down. The performances have been great. We all know the story, but it has not been done before in Telugu cinema. In some ways, this can be called modern Devdas with realistic dialogue.Without spoiling; the story is about a young MBBS student with anger management issues falling in love. Arjun Reddy's character is deeply flawed. I must appreciate the director and crew steering away from the Telugu movie way of showing the lead character in a perfect light. I am glad the character is flawed. There are several instances in this 186 minute movie that shows us the flawed side of our hero. It works out for the story telling. Also in this tale, we see characters yelling swear words when under stress or anger; which does not happen in other flicks.The physical romance couldn't be more appropriate. It's is present where necessary and only promotes story telling and emotions. Also, the story is also about a bunch of characters constantly caring and supporting Arjun Reddy despite his strong requirement for sole confinement. The sick kick friend is more than a side kick shows real spine in tense moments, also providing subtle comedy in the various situations. The movie does not commit to one message. The grandma says ""a person who wants to suffer must be left alone and that person will soon get back on his feet""; But almost all characters related to the hero (Brother, friends) always keep visiting Arjun despite Arjun yelling them to go away. It was the supporting friends and family that bring back a almost lost soul back. When Arjun loses everything, left with no money and thrown on the road; it's the brother and father who spend their money to send Arjun to exotic countries to help him get over the girl.The movie doesn't seem 3 hour long, but definitely feels lengthy, often straining the eyes. Preethi's character is underdeveloped, but she did a decent job at that. The heroin side track was unnecessary and does not contribute much.Overall, this is a refreshing change in Tollywood and I can see a lot of directors experimenting by not following the Telugu formulaic trend in the upcoming years.",positive
"Hello, My Name Is Doris","I thought this was a comedy. Turned out it was very sad and kept me up all night as I was so upset about this poor old lady being in humiliating situations so many times. I found it to be a heartbreaking movie that made it appear as though love between an older lady and a younger man could not be possible. The old lady was very attaching and I loved her. She played her role beautifully. I just do not see what is funny about this movie, unless you like to laugh at vulnerable old ladies.",negative
"Hello, My Name Is Doris","Sally Field gets the role of a lifetime as a hoarder working in a trendy office who has the hots for a younger employee. One of the best things about ""Hello, My Name Is Doris"" is that it shows how Doris is sort of an oddball and can irritate those around her, but is nonetheless a good person. She was the only sibling who took care of their mom. Basically, Doris wants to stick to her house and possessions, and their representation of the old days amid a world that advances too quickly for her, and her attraction to this younger man is the only possible sexual satisfaction for her. Most of all, it's refreshing to see a movie that focuses on older women (aside from Doris, there's her friend Roz, played by Tyne Daly). One of the most impressive scenes is when Doris gets photographed (and believe me, Sally Field looks sexy in some of those outfits that she wears).The long and short of it is that ""Hello, My Name Is Doris"" is a really good movie. Sally Field has gotten some of the best roles of her career later in life, and I hope that she continues to do so. She, Tyne Daly, and the rest of the cast put in fine performances. I recommend this movie to everyone.",positive
Fukrey,"Fukrey has got its base trembling with a plot so naive, viewer discretion is recommended. Its screenplay is bit confusing for people who don't pay attention. Otherwise, it is a healthy Bollywood comedy film.Cast performance is nothing to talk about but the actors have managed to create enough chemistry between themselves. Although love doesn't come center-stage, it amuses. The music is catchy, but the lilts could've been improvised. Same theme music is used all over the 130 minutes. Cinematography, I would say, is brilliant especially shots involving mirrors. Editing is quite good.But, since the foundation itself is slimy, I rate it an AVERAGE 5.7/10. Mixing lucid dreams with reality doesn't really prove a point. The story in second half is much like Delhi Belly & other caper films where a gang try hard to please a big boss. It's a bit clichéd but the journey adopted by the Fukreys is enjoyable. They entertain and that is what matters.Dialogs are funny & straight, songs are good and overall, a fine comedy without classic cinema potential.

Fukrey,"Fukrey, directed by Mrigdeep Singh Lamba and produced by Farhan Akhtar/Ritesh Sidhwani is set in the bylanes of East Delhi and is about four youngsters who want to make it big in life - but through adopting shortcuts !Cocky Hunny(Pulkit Samrat) and goofy Choocha(Varun Sharma) are two slackers who want to get into a reputed college with the solo intention of ditching classes and ogling at girls. Accounting-phobic Laali (Manjot Singh)wants to get into this college because her lady love. Wannabe musician,Zafar(Ali Fazal)needs funds for his father's treatment. All of them need fast buck and make a deal with a wicked hustler,Bholi Punjabi(Richa Chaddha) but their adventure misfires big time when Choocha flounders.In this bizarre twist of events, how the band of boys come out unscathed forms the crux of Fukrey.Much of the film's sheen is derived from its situational humor and Mrigdeep Lamba , who made the horrendous Teen The Bhai, takes a giant leap in direction and writing with a sharp eye for details and getting the nuances of middle-class lifestyle of Delhi-ites right.The narrative is smooth and Lamba infuses some of the ROFL moments when Laali's bike parts are stolen each time outside the Gurudwara or Choocha escapes from Bholi's henchmen. Delhi Belly Dejavu !Choocha's inspection,oops I mean Inception-inspired dreams and Honey decoding them into a lottery number are sheer master-strokes !Ram Sampath's music is peppy and rustic with fresh voices and sync well with the proceedings. Ambarsariya, the traditional Punjabi folk song tops the list, with Sona Mohapatra's mellifluous renderings!The camaraderie depicted between Honey and Choocha is the heart of the enterprise and will have you in splits. Pulkit is endearing as the jugaadu-dude of the gang.His mannerisms are very typical of a Delhi boy and he gets the act right. Manjot Singh makes a solid impact with his straight-faced humor and impeccable dialogue delivery.Ali Fazal bores a serious look on his face and does justice to his character.Varun Sharma as Choocha is the scene-stealer and the real surprise package. As a debutante , he exudes ample confidence.Richa Chaddha outshines our fukras with her superb act of Bholi Punjaban and once again proves her supreme talent.Priya Anand and Vishakha Singh are adequate, and don't get much of scope in this male-dominated fare.Pankaj Tripathi,as usual,is first-rate.On the whole, Fukrey is indubitably a fresh wave of comedy with a fitting finale and a justified message to today's youth. I laughed and laughed , until my jaws ached and belly gave pangs.Worth a second time watch !Rating : 4/5",positive

Mr. Morgan's Last Love,"1st off Michael is a widower, American living in Pars, a Philosophy Professor who was of course teaching at a top ivy league college. No one can teach in the Univ of Penn, or Michigan. Get tenure at any decent college is challenging. His accent is awful. really awful. Like an English is a 2nd language person who speaks good English. Couldn't he be an Englishman, who married an American and went to USA to teach. How come no one notices the bad accent, when casting and showing 1st scenes. Michael is a seasoned professional, didn't he listen to himself?There are other problems, with the characters and the plot development. but I prefer not to give any spoilers.it really is rather slow- and very sentimental (which means melodramatic, over the top)not a spoiler, but for instance, Parisian Clemence speaks very good English, but Micheal corrects her a few times, which would be understandable for someone who didn't speak well. For instance ""faites"" in French, is making or doing, so English could be doing or making depending on the action. She explained she speaks English well because her father, who she was close to, was American. so if she grew up speaking, she would know the correct English verb & phrases. Someone thought this ""charming""interlude should go into the dialogue, not 1X but 3X.it kind of meandered, so that I didn't know where they were going. Not a good thing.While sure, the Widower missed the love of his life, only gone 3 years, but these too many wonky scenes with him talking to his dead wife, didn't make for a good story.",negative
Mr. Morgan's Last Love,"Michael Caine is getting old. Playing an old man, acting or real? He is at his best. Gone is his dry humor and whit, gone is also his regular British accent (apart from a few strongly emotional scenes when he suddenly looses the American accent he is supposed to have).This is a very odd movie, difficult to put into any frame. The acting is nothing else but superb, not a single moment without complete realism.Watch this move alone or with your significant other, do not forget the paper napkins, because this is very emotional. My eyes are still wet, this is a movie that will remain in my mind for a long time.",positive
Kapoor & Sons,"Lot's of people and critics are praising about this movie. Some are saying that this is the best of this year up till now. But, frankly speaking, I'm not agree with these kind of statements or even these kind of positive reviews of this movie. Director Shakun Batra, who earlier directed Ek Main Aur Ek Tu, which was not a hit, comes back with this family drama. I must say it is far better than the previous one. The major plus point is the screenplay. Scenes have been written so well. Because of that, the shooting schedule had been completed in a shorter time, I guess. Actors are good. Location is suitable. Background score is perfect. And I think, because of the number of twists and turns is more in the post interval part, critics loved this film. But, I want to ask them, what about the boring portions in the first half!? Alia Bhatt is as cute as she looks earlier in her films. Sidharth Malhotra lacks in acting in some scenes. And I heard this statement from many viewers. Rajat Kapoor is good. Rishi Kapoor is funny and adorable. His make-up is the only time-taking thing in the whole movie. Two factors that affect the movie are Fawad Khan and Ratna Pathak Shah. She is the best actor of this movie. And for Fawad, if you please don't consider his character, haha, I like him. He looks hot and charming and stylish. So, a hero material has been found. He will go far and up. Chul song is a waste of time for me. Two background songs are good. Comedy is fine. Bhajan in iPad, Mandakini the heroine, the plumber asking for the money- these are my favorite comic scenes. So, I think this film is a one time watch. As I've seen Pyar Ka Punchnama 2 as an overrated movie last year, this movie stands for this category in this year. On the whole, I am confuse about what I get from the film. So the praising audience, who find out the meaning of life and relationships from this film, can you help me",negative
Kapoor & Sons,"Watching Bollywood movies , you get disillusioned seeing the crassness, but some producers/Directors know their Job well.this weekend release Kapoor and sons (since 1921) proved that right again .In simple words this movie shouldn't be missed.A family entertainer which churns your heart to the core and brings out that baby emotions hidden somewhere. Now coming back to film script is marvelous with all characters beautifully crafted,u long for each one of them, everybody have their problems and their own worries. Casting was done aptly, beautiful acting by all ,special mention Rishi kapoor he's your comic boy in this movie.songs are beautifully interwoven with beautiful lyrics with astutely crafted music. In one go its a must watch.........Family is most important adhesive, don't stretch it that much, so that it looses its capability and doesn't bind anymore.",positive
G.B.F.,"The humor is fast paced, cheeky, full of innuendo, clever and sweet. The language is full of metaphors and brilliant. They talk just like the people I hang around with. The comedy delivery and acting are wonderful. The plot is perfect for a high school story. I loved it. Just watch it and make up your own mind but I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",negative
G.B.F.,"This movie is very well made,never apologizing for anything, and why should it? There is a very unPCness delivered by an excellent cast who are all fully committed to the story, and a very well written story it just happens to be. Mean girls to the extreme, and full of tongue in cheek real life truthful feelings. The entire movie has great background, and the entire screen is filled very well most of the time, so you may Enjoy this a second time. Over all I really did like this movie, It started out kind of corny, but then the characters just fell into place, and they all start to become more real, and vulnerable. More of the truth begins to slip out before it all hits the floor. So I would recommend this for Mothers to watch with their Sons, and for others to just watch it, there is a lot of good humour in here, and a good feeling or 2 to be had as well.",positive
Las brujas de Zugarramurdi,"A stupid movie absolutely not funny.
Bad acting. For kids only.
Don't watch if you have a brain.
Nothing There.",negative
Las brujas de Zugarramurdi,"This fast paced, Spanish film is simultaneously a really disturbing horror tale, a meditation on the battle of the sexes, and one of the funniest movies I've seen in years. Things get off to a lightning start with a holdup of a gold buying emporium in downtown Madrid by criminals posing as living statues with a critical assist provided by a ten year old accomplice, one of the wildest film heist scenes I've ever seen and worth the price of admission alone. Seriously, you'll never forget the sight of a gold painted Jesus sprinting for his life while toting a little kid who's shooting back two handed at the police.A beginning like that would be hard to surpass, but W&B continues to pile it on under Alex de la Iglesia's masterful direction. Having commandeered a cab whose driver willingly agrees to assist them, the criminals try to flee north to France to escape the law and to fulfill the promise made by the leader, José (Hugo Silva), to take his son to Disneyworld in Paris, with the police and José's divorced wife in hot pursuit. Already a tense situation for the hapless thieves, things take a decided turn for the weird and the worse when they reach the witch infested town of Zugarramurdi, in the heart of Basque country. Led by a three generation family (the oldest witch reminded me of Grandmama from the Addams Family), the witches capture the thieves with malign designs upon them, namely to use the men as sacrifices to restore an oppressive matriarchy.The pace rarely lets up and the jokes fly fast and furious, interspersed with over the top, gross out scenes of gore. The men lament their inability to get along with women only to find themselves trapped in a decaying mansion (is there any other kind in a horror movie?) by a bunch of smiling, evil, literal witches who want to torture, kill, and eat them. They fight back as best they can, but their fates ultimately depend upon the attraction felt by the youngest witch in the family (well played by the stunningly beautiful Carolina Bang) for bumbling José. The climactic scene of a Witches' Sabbath simply has to be seen to be believed, but I won't give away any spoilers.About the only real criticism I have of this film is the English title, which I don't think accurately conveys what the film's about. The Spanish title, Las Brujas De Zugarramurdi, The Witches Of Zugarramurdi, was apparently a non-starter due to the long, difficult Basque place name. This minor cavil aside, this was a crackerjack movie, absolutely entertaining from start to finish.I recommend this film to horror fans who don't mind comedy mixed in with the scares (some horror fans are big purists that way) and anybody who likes a good laugh in general, although I will provide the trigger warning that this is not for anyone with a weak stomach.",positive
Synchronicity,"I was quite shocked to see how low the rating was on this film, and I can only imagine it is because people struggled to keep a grasp on a self entwined looping plot. This is a wormhole based movie, so expect it to be a bit loopy.Probably don't watch it with a girlfriend/wife who isn't in to this genre (they'll not enjoy it and will wreck it for you to by asking for explanations continually... and that would be distracting on a complicated plot which moves fairly swiftly), and it would be best enjoyed without beer (you do need to concentrate to keep up), but other than that I found it excellent. Visually nice, the music was quite 'daft punk'/Tron in places (good on a home cinema system), the actors could act, the female lead was sexy and they tied all the pieces together. What more could you ask for. My 10/10 is probably a bit excessive, I put it this high to try and offset the people who don't understand and have been slating it. In reality it is a solid 8.7/10: not perfect, but getting close.",negative
Synchronicity,"I'm giving it 10 stars because the movie was far better by the end than I thought it would be at the start. From the start though our cinematic sensibilities pick up quickly that there is not an ""Independence Day"" budget attached. With a slew of time-travel themed movies recently relying on great story telling and acting and others on big budgets and vacuous stars I wasn't sure where this one would fall but immediately one was struck by it's style. A noir look and compelling soundtrack. But as the recursive story picked up - well written and a fine cast - any misgivings were forgotten. This is an original story with not just fine twists but also perhaps a first in the time travel genre it's quite sexy. Great chemistry between the two main characters added up to a compelling tale that crossed interestingly between lust and science. Not since Forbidden Planet haha joking but the soundtrack again is worth mentioning and will make a second viewing as enjoyable as the first. Sci-fi has been burdened by the heavy handed scores of John Williams for far too long. Ben Lovett provides a beautifully apt real si-fi soundtrack to a real sci-fi film.Don't be misled by simplistic reviewers, it is a quite clever concoction of ideas but spread out across it's time frame with all the right moments well embedded the story is well told.Jacob Gentry is a person of future interest.",positive
Jab Harry Met Sejal,"I watched the movie with my wife yesterday and it started randomly with Shahrukh trying to over act tourist guide life. Suddenly he meets one more dumbo ""Sejal"" who leaves her fiancé to find some ring and travels all around Europe with reluctant Shahrukh. Finally they fall in love. Seriously thats the gist and including this it has over acting of shahrukh , Dumbness of Anushka, Silly Jokes.What were you thinking about it Mr Imtiaz Ali.. This movie should be banned from theatres as it is having lots of negative Effect of human Values and thoughts.. In fact this has actually caused me overnight headache . Probably this movie should come with a complimentary DISPRIN and psychologist appointments.If this movie is Love Story in your definition, then probably go back to 90's and start over. Shahrukh Khan - Please STOP here. I have loved your movies in 90's , but now its not selling. I bet even you would not watch this for 2:30 mins..",negative
Jab Harry Met Sejal,"What happened to Shahrukh from Chak De India and Swadesh? That Shahrukh who used to do good movies like that and now he keeps churning out bad movies back to back. Can anyone call that old Shahrukh and send this new Shahrukh to whatever hellhole he came from!? This movie is no different from his earlier movies he has done before, it's not even an original movie but a copy of Hollywood romantic classic ""When Harry met Sally"". They will tell you it's different..yeah, right! If Shahrukh is not going to do a original movie and copy-paste some movie and then at least do it properly...you had one job for god sake!!!Shakrukh is 51 years old but still he is doing romantic movies, he should start doing movies which suits his age. In this movie, he is playing a lover boy who is in his 20s-30s. He looks more like a grandfather of Anushka than her love interest. Shahrukh did an overacting as usual, just horrible horrible like he is suffering from seizure which is coming every one minute. If that's not his acting and that's how he has became in real life, then he should check those seizures out from a doctor, my sympathy for him and although, sometimes Anushka does an amazing job but in this, she has those expressions in her face which makes me want to punch her. I think that has to do with her botched lip surgery, that's why she can't emote and speak properly. While they travels the world together in this movie, they should go to a doctor together too.What to say about this movie? Nothing new, just another one where boy meet girl, girl meet boy and then they eventually fall in love with each other like we haven't seen clichés like this which has been rehashed like 5677234556 times. The movie was so awful that I should be given some kind of award for managed to sit throughout the end. Firstly I don't find the story enjoyable. To make a whole film about two people meeting through various stages of their lives and slowly, or should I say very slowly, starting a relationship is boring. Secondly I did not find anything funny. I was looking for some laughs, but it turned to be a total dud, like it's trying too hard to be funny. I could not focus on the film and whatever story there was in it, because dialogues were mostly forced and unnecessarily long. Maybe this is poor writing, maybe poor editing, but in any case, it resulted in a film that is hard to watch. What happened to the directer like Imtiaz Ali like his mind was too distracted while making this movie.You will only like this movie if you are too blinded by love for Shahrukh that you refuse to see any fault in his movie. They won't even agree with my review too like I'm not allowed to give an constructive criticism like you can see how they are giving this movie 9-10. I bet most of them haven't even seen the movie. Then again, it's the case with most of the Shahrukh movies where fake up voting is necessary so that general public can't see how piece of crap his movies are actually are. So watch this movie if you're a Shahrukh fan and if you are neutral like I am, then prepare to be disappointed AGAIN!!!!!",positive
Ae Dil Hai Mushkil,"This is not just a bad film but a disgrace to film industry. Karan Johar, you just buried the Indian Cinema deep down the grave.Initial bit of the movie is obnoxious! Lame acting, silly comedy, same old dialogues and irritating acting. Here they make a mockery of love and relationships where people sleep around and just jump between partners. Then comes and love part which fails to delivery the gravity.Later comes Aishwarya, which is the only watchable section. This section delivers some good acting and the story starts to move. And then it stalls very badly immediately. Well, the Sharukh Khan scene is pretty good. Am not his fan but the entire movie sucks so bad that his acting feels better.The worst section is the cancer part. OMG what a disaster! Super insult to the cancer patients. These so called stars of bollywood are so naive, they don't even want to shave their heads for the role but wear a bald wig! How convenient. No struggle of cancer established and Anushka looks like an alien in that wig.Her head is bald because of cancer but her eyebrows and eyelashes are in-tact. Bravo! Karan, are you serious?Karan is so obsessed with himself, the movie has so many unwanted irksome KKHH and KANH tunes forcibly added into it, gosh so horrible. Is this your mature filmmaking?And then you see these English and French people enjoying all Hindi songs these actors have to sing. There is a scene where Ranbir is singing a Hindi song with his so called band in a Church, lolSo many better filmmakers don't even get a chance to complete or initiate their film projects and such filthy rich ones fool people with such horrific movies. Karan has lost it. Twinkle made a good choice!!Please don't watch it even if someone puts a gun to your head. Take the shot, at least its quick!!",negative
Ae Dil Hai Mushkil,"First of all, let me clear one fact- I am not a Ranbir Kapoor fan. If you were expecting some typical karan johar/Bollywood drama, this is not the one for you. I would request everyone to first watch and UNDERSTAND this film rather than commenting negatively. Please watch the film rather than listening to people around you and then decide for yourself. The Review: The movie is a mirror image of a modern, high class societal life. Probably the single screen audience(and maybe some of the urban audiences as well) can never relate to it. You desire to love someone but never receive any reciprocation. How would you feel? What would you do to overcome the pain? How would you make the person realize that your love is true, eternal and important? This movie is all about that. There are some direction errors but Ranbir's terrific performance makes up for all the faults. Maybe a lesser number of songs would have helped but come-on, all of them were soothing for the ears. Some people complained about the intimate scenes and said they it was not appropriate for family audience. But isn't it the reality(and come on, the trailer depicted some of them so if you felt inappropriate you shouldn't have come)? Everyone have delivered some terrific performances- Anushka as the bubbly and trying to be carefree girl(but actually caring from heart) and Aishwarya as an experienced woman, one who has seen life and is keenly looking for true love etc. The emotions manage to strike your heart(A few people among the audience sitting before us cried after the movie got over). If this is not considered to be a good movie, I don't know what is...",positive
Syrup,"I haven't read the book, but reading the comments it would appear as though its fairly different so I don't think this matters much as far as a review of the film is concerned.The main thing that distracted me through the whole movie was the casting of Shiloh Fernandez as Scat, other than maybe having the look of a sleazy marketer, he seemed massively out of place as a male lead. I didn't think there was any chemistry between him and Amber Heard at all, any attraction between the two seemed totally implausible. He'd probably be fine in a supporting role, but not as a lead. I was wondering the whole time if his father financed the movie or something to get him the role.Other than that the movie was OK, it did seem to be trying to hard to be cool and edgy and didn't really pull it off. Sure it had a tiny budget, but if anything doing things on a shoe string should make a movie more cool and edgy, but it wasn't at all. Everything that was meant to be cool seemed forced and cliché.On the positive side, I thought Amber Heard was great as 6, as was her character. I can see why the ending left a few unhappy, but I think it was better to do what they did than just some by the numbers rom-com ending.",negative
Syrup,"This movie is nowhere near as clever as it believes it is. It is hip to a certain extent, but they overdo it in a big way. Marketing energy drinks with names like ""Fukk"" is clever and funny at first, especially with all that jokes that come along with it, but it gets stagnant rather quickly. There is plenty of stereotyping and sexism as well, along with breaking the fourth wall with some admittedly clever inner monologue. The story isn't strong enough, so they try to be as cool as possible. The first half isn't half-bad. It's cool, sharp, and even clever at certain points. I was kind of digging it to a certain extent. Sadly, it runs out of fuel in the second half, and turns into a mortality tale that is filled with ethics. It becomes overly serious, and it turned me off to be honest. It doesn't help that our two leads are as selfish as can possibly be. As sexy and fun as Amber Heard is, the ""enigmatic"" character of hers got on my nerves. I was able to put up with it, because Amber is so gorgeous, but her character is needlessly childish. Heard manages to overcome it all with sheer talent, and her galvanizing presence, but her character does her no favors. She didn't feel like a human being at all. Shiloh Fernandez is a tad on the blind side. His smug performance wasn't exactly endearing. His character angered me. He's a bit of a slacker, and manages to achieve success. It sent the wrong message in my opinion. His chemistry with Heard wasn't that great. Brittany Snow is always a welcome presence, but her cameo felt out of place and otiose. The worst thing about this movie might just be the ending. It tries to distinguish itself from fantasy and reality, and I didn't buy it. Overall, this movie was cold. I was left wondering what the point of it was. Everything about this movie is cold. I didn't care for it at all. It never bored me, but more substance was needed. It's just too unlikable and crass for it's own good 4.7/10",positive
Raanjhanaa,"Dhanush who had earlier wooed the South Indian audience with his acting skills, chose a script tailor made for him to launch himself into Bollywood. The movie, doesn't disappoint those who enjoyed the stories where love stands above everything else in life. To top it all, when you have ARR weaving his magic with some sublime music, the beauty of Banaras just comes alive in front of your eyes. The three main characters, all have their own shades of grey and more often than not they stem from Love. Sonam for once does justice to her role, she grew into her role as the movie progressed and gave a telling performance that she could reflect back with pride. Abhay was as flawless as ever, just easing through his role with nonchalant ease. It would only be fair if i end where I started - Dhanush simply stole the show with his intense portrayal of a person driven by love, a person who does the most stupid, brave and incomprehensible of things in the name of love. My Verdict: Expect a love story with a traditional characterization supported by some brilliant music and clean performances by the lead cast - you won't be disappointed.",negative
Raanjhanaa,"Lovely movie, it had a twist and a blend of action, drama, romance, a little bit fiction too. The movie is worth a watch. it displays the actuality of the people, their nature and all i loved the romantic part of the movie as well. it was fun, interesting and very very entertaining too. I seriously recommend it to be watched. it has a little bit abuses which aren't suitable for a child's attention. if you are looking for a movie to watch for fun, to cry, to feel love, experience pain,i am pretty astonished about ""Dhanush"" as this was his first movie in the Bollywood and he made his mark pretty high. People it must be watched at least once, and i am very sure about going to the cinemas to see it again Enjoy, It is not something either that will get you bored during the movie.

L'écume des jours,"It's been a long time since I've been acquainted with Michel Gondry. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Science of Sleep are two of my all-time favourite films. Be Kind Rewind was an unfortunate misfire but I already warmly welcome his style. However, I've never seen him quite so unrestrained like this. Mood Indigo is a truly fantasy world. No dream, no drugs, and nothing is how you'd expect. Not even dancing, not even a handshake. To say the world of Mood Indigo is surreal and absurd is an understatement and no words can quite grasp the chaos on screen. It's like an R-rated Dr. Seuss. Like Gilliam's Brazil. But, it's an absolute delight. Things may not make sense at any point, but it's not about symbolism, it's about expressionism. The characters are deeply human, and that's what counts. All these inventions, twists, obscurities all about emotion. And Mood Indigo constantly had me bellying with laughter or sinking an anchor in my stomach when tragedy strikes even when I wasn't sure what was happening.That's the spirit of filmmaking really, to feel how the characters are feeling, and this film achieves it admirably. But at times it is so dense that its hard to keep up. The special effects and production design are wonderful, but the way it's shot in HD does sometimes nullify its effects and brings us back to reality in a way it doesn't want (I would've preferred Gondry to not have his cameo). Sometimes the cast can't even keep up with it. I really wasn't sure about the cast at first. They're familiar faces, but they didn't seem to suit the tone, plus they felt too old. However, with the film's dark twist in the second half, so dark the film turns black and white, it did become apparent that these cast members fit this melancholic side of the world. I wish it wasn't so bloated in characters and was more restrained like The Science of Sleep. The great soundtrack definitely adds to its rich atmosphere too. I do hope this film will stick with me like his two best films. It may be manic, but it's thoroughly charming. Not Gondry's best but his best in a long while.8/10",negative
L'écume des jours,"When I decided to go see that movie, I was really scared. Scared that, somehow, this movie might be bad, whereas the book of Boris Vian is one of my favorite. But when I got out, I was really amazed. I felt almost depressed, exactly the same way when I finished reading the book. For the whole night long, I couldn't keep my mind of the movie, and I was barely able to sleep. Gondry actually made me open my eyes about some things, that I couldn't imagine or figure out. But when I think about it, it just make sense. Like the fact that Alise is black woman. I don't know why, I've always imagined her as a white and blonde woman. But it's only natural that she is in fact black.I can understand the fact that some people would not like the movie, being very weird, and being in it's own universe. But I really think this movie deserves a way better grade. Maybe one of the greatest adaptations that I have seen, yet. I gladly recommend to see this movie.",positive
A Case of You,"Chose to watch this one night when I couldn't decide what to watch and needed something quite easy. Well.. I was pleasantly surprised. This film which pitches itself as a romantic comedy actually had a bit of hidden depth in the shape of its protagonist and his issues around relationships, no doubt related to his relationship with his mum. It sounds quite serious but is quite funny really. The starry cameos, including Peter Dinklage as a camp Barista, and Sam Rockwell as a hippie guitar teacher all add to a general quirky humour. Its not amazing by any standard but if you fancy a romance which is entertaining, amusing but makes you think a little I'd recommend you give it a whirl!",negative
A Case of You,"I'll admit right up front I quit watching after an hour, not because it was bad but because it was nothing new. If you're unfamiliar with the ""manic pixie"" story, think of Natalie Portman in ""Garden State"" or Zooey Deschanel in everything she's ever done. Or if you want to get right down to it, there's the original and greatest manic pixie that ever was: Audrey Hepburn. The formula is you take 1 lovable loser guy, usually stiff, awkward or outright lame, and you pair him with a girl who is hazardously spontaneous and carefree as if she's still suffering the effects of novacaine from the dentist an hour earlier. Personally I love these kinds of films, but I love them because it's interesting to see the unique angle each one offers. But here in ""A Case of You"" there is no angle.So what we get are endless scenes of the guy making a fool out of himself and the girl pirouetting through the scenes not noticing. There's a very weak, contrived ""conflict"" (the guy is facebook stalking her), but I don't have to watch the last 20 minutes to guess exactly how it ends. I'm guessing: revelation, confrontation, reconciliation. It's the standard formula just like the rest of the story was up to the point I turned it off.You might enjoy this movie if you're not familiar with the manic pixie formula, but if you are, then watching this flick is sort of like reading a teen vampire book. You know exactly how it's going to go but you read it anyway because War & Peace gives you a headache.Where this movie fails, beyond simply being a lukewarm copy of all the others, is that there is nothing quirky about the manic pixie (Evan Rachel Wood). There is no depth, no bizarre secret past, no soul. For example, in the excellent ""Garden State"" we get Natalie Portman who is a manic pixie on the surface but we soon learn that she suffers from a spectrum of problematic mental issues like pathological lying. It gives her character complexity and makes her interesting to us. Similarly if we look at Audrey Hepburn's manic pixie (take ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"") we get the same superficial happy-go-lucky exterior but we are fully aware that she is more or less a prostitute. Again, tremendous complexity to an otherwise predictable character.But here in ""A Case for You"" there is absolutely no complexity. There is nothing out of the ordinary about either of the two, except that he's an awkward loser and she's a social butterfly.I do give it points for some excellent (yet all too brief) cameos by Sam Rockwell as a hilariously egotistical guitar teacher, Peter Dinklage as a riotously funny coffee shop barista, and Vince Vaughn as a fast talking corporate suit who ought to have a Bluetooth headset surgically attached to his head. These scenes absolutely carried the film, but ultimately the story itself gives us nothing new.Instead of this I would recommend any of the others I mentioned, as well as an unknown Japanese gem ""Shiki-Jitsu"" (Ritual) written by, and starring, Ayako Fujitani who is Steven Seagal's daughter (NO RESEMBLANCE!).",positive
Hoje Eu Quero Voltar Sozinho,"When Daniel Ribeiro's sweet and charming short film 'I Don't Want to Go Back Alone' released in 2010, I was completely in love with it. I was eagerly looking forward to watching this movie since its announcement. Though I still consider the short to be simple, nuanced and better, I liked how Ribeiro beautifully adapted the short into a feature film. Of course, he kept the same talented young actors; they've grown, and have done a commendable and mature job. I liked how Ribeiro changed a few parts from the short film, but kept the essence and feel of the story intact; he incorporates the memorable dialogues and moments from the short into the feature film appropriately.It's the story of a blind guy named Leo, his best friend Giovana, and how their lives change after the arrival of new student, Gabriel. The movie is basically about equality and sexuality. Blind, not blind, or whatever... ultimately, all we seek is love, and independence. We never choose whom we fall in love with.Though the movie explores themes of friendship, independence, bullying, etc., overall, the movie essentially remains the same as the short; I feel, the characters and situations could have been explored further. But overall, I still like the film; it's heartwarming and delightful.The title song used in the movie, 'There's Too Much Love' by Belle and Sebastian, is quite mesmerizing. Every time it played during the film, at appropriate moments, my heart was filled with joy. And the main kiss between Leo and Gabriel towards the end is really passionate and moving.",negative
Hoje Eu Quero Voltar Sozinho,"This movie is amazingly good. I already had a taste of it with the short ""Eu não quero voltar sozinho"" and could not wait to watch the full movie. I had great expectations before even seeing the teasers or trailers... The movie is sweet, delicate and makes you feel so good! The characters are really well constructed. You can see how the actors improved and grew up. The dialogues flow naturally, and the camera works really well with the story. Although I already knew what would happen (because of the short) I was thrilled on many scenes. A really nice touch of the movie was to use small dialogues of the short. The movie makes you want to sit on the movie theatre for many hours. The music made me really happy. I was bobbing my head every time Belle And Sebastian was on, and could not hide my smile on the entire movie. The scenes are so well constructed that you forget that you are watching a movie - it has a dream-like feeling, even on the scenes where there is prejudice. Daniel Ribeiro did an amazing job, and so did the actors. I am in love with the story. This movie is for everyone who believes in love.",positive
Fading Gigolo,"Quirky stuff here!! If you like oddball, this movie could appeal to you.Well-written and great musical accompaniment. John Turtorro does a Woody Allen – and does it well! It's a great assortment of extreme characters – particularly the women, from Sharon Stone and Sofia Vergara who play unrepressed hotties - to Vanessa Paradis who plays a repressed Hasidic Jewish woman. So there is a lot going on – and it definitely gets your attention. And it's never predictable! And really I don't quite know the point of the film – religion represses women could be one. Be prepared there are a lot of surprising antics!",negative
Fading Gigolo,"Here is a film that is pleasantly unique and special. A film that is a bit different, probably my own misunderstanding, than advertised from the trailers. It's not a bad thing, the trailers brought me to the film, and the film kept my curiosity for the entire length. I liked it quite a bit unsurprising to you dear reader, as you've already seen my rating. The film was written & directed by it's main star, John Turturro, and what a grand achievement it is. Also starring in supporting roles and fantastic to say the least; Sharon Stone, Sofia Vergara, Liev Schreiber, Vanessa Paradis, and New York's own, film legend Woody Allen. I found while watching this film, and though the characters played by Turturro & Allen were enjoyable to watch, I was fascinated mostly with Paradis' character and her story. I'm not Jewish myself, so I'm very naive to the culture and their religious practices, and found it a interesting insight to a, I'm sure, small portion of what it may be like to be of Jewish faith. Though, and I said I was naive to the culture, it may not be entirely true. With that said, I found a film that surprised me positively and thus was quite better than I expected.",positive
Freeheld,"In a time when our nation is going through some the most progressive and long overdue changes in history, a film as timely as ""Freeheld"" would be welcomed with open arms and minds from critics and audiences. Unfortunately, what director Peter Sollett creates, in partnership with Academy Award nominated screenwriter Ron Nyswaner, is an uninspired, insipid, and downright cheap take on a same-sex couple fighting for death benefits.Starring recently Oscar-crowned Julianne Moore and Ellen Page, the two manage decent chemistry and maneuver through generic and Lifetime movie-like lines. The impressive Michael Shannon does his very best to elevate all the material, showing the if you're talented enough, no script can hold you back. On the hand, the rest of the cast, particularly Steve Carell, is so over-the-top, and poorly guided, that everything that could have made ""Freeheld"" a spectacular and moving drama, is quickly transformed into a distorted and tragic version of the Oscar-winning short that the film is based on. The most novice filmmakers could have created something more gratifying.""Freeheld"" tells the story of New Jersey police lieutenant, Laurel Hester (Moore), and her registered domestic partner, Stacie Andree (Page). When Laurel is diagnosed with terminal cancer, both battle to secure Hester's pension benefits.After just winning her long overdue Academy Award for last year's ""Still Alice,"" the excitement and anticipation for Julianne Moore's next role was at an all-time high. Moore, as we come to expect, commits firmly to the role of a dying woman. Reminiscent of performances like Hilary Swank in ""Million Dollar Baby,"" Moore dives into her psyche, offering her soul to a woman who lived her life with secrets, and became alive in her later years. While Nyswaner's script offers little insight into Laurel and Stacie's love, outside of montages and cancer treatments, Moore finds her way through the pitfalls to come out on the other side intact. Page, who was a strong voice in getting the picture made, is relegated to crying and awkward ticks. Several instances, we are led to believe that ""this scene"" will be ""her scene"" where she gets the chance to let loose and show us what she's all about. Once again, Sollett's plain and boring direction quickly cut her every scene short, and offer no room to explore her character's surroundings and feelings. It's a terrible waste of talent.Michael Shannon delivers a competent and layered performance as Dane, Laurel's cop partner. He finds the humanity and conflict in Dane's misunderstanding about Laurel's lifestyle and later in the fight for equality. He's the film's key positive note. Carell's over-the-top yelling and mannerisms is among the worst acting examples seen in 2015. It's as if Sollett decided to let ""Michael Scott"" from ""The Office"" run amok on the set because that's all that Carell manages to evoke. One year after a career-topping work in ""Foxcatcher,"" I'm embarrassed that this is his next venture for the world to behold.Even down to the cheesy score by Hans Zimmer, nothing about ""Freeheld"" sings. It lays dormant in a small courtroom, where anger and inspiration are supposed to fly but lies lifeless among the picket signs and Josh Charles' snarls. I was sincerely hoping for something better, actually something magnificent; too bad there's not enough vision to bring this powerful story to life.",negative
Freeheld,"If you've already seen Philadelphia (1993, with Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington), you'll watch Freeheld and have a feeling of déjà vu. Written by the same screenwriter, Ron Nyswaner, Freeheld has all the elements of its predecessor: (i) it's inspired by true events, (ii) the main character has a disease and enters into a legal battle while sick, and (iii) there is a lot of prejudice against homosexuals. Despite all the similarities, Philadelphia is superior, and I'll try to explain why.As Tom Hanks in Philadelphia, we see Julianne Moore transforms physically as the disease progresses. She always gives great performances, but I felt like I enjoyed it more during the first act, when she was struggling to keep her relationship a secret. Ellen Page is also great, especially when she's defied by her future boss who doesn't believe she can work repairing cars because she's a woman.Having said that, the best character, in my opinion, is Dane Wells (Michael Shannon), Laurel's partner in the police who struggles with himself when he finds out she's gay, but ends up helping her. Steve Carell is also in the cast and he was very applauded by the audience in the session I was in. He definitely gave the film a lighter and funnier tone, since it's clearly a tearjerker.Philadelphia had a different effect on me because the characters involved are more complex: the audience knows why Tom Hanks' character was fired, but the discussion is deeper than ""because he's gay"". In Freeheld, on the other hand, we see the ""Freeholders"" discussing Laurel's request behind close doors and their decision is simple and fast, with no further questions (except for Josh Charles' character). So, even though we all knew the ending to both films before they actually end, Freeheld felt like an old formula to me. Full review: http://wp.me/p5Rk4c-em",positive
Omar,"""The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a tragedy, a clash between one very powerful, very convincing, very painful claim over this land and another no less powerful, no less convincing claim."" Amos OzIt's not easy to fit the story of Romeo and Juliet into a thriller about the Arab-Israeli conflict, but filmmaker Hany Abu-Assad does it with care and believability. So good is he in that balancing act that the notoriously endless national struggle is almost overshadowed by the challenging love Omar (Adam Bakri) has for Nadja (Leem Lubany). Palestinian Omar, an impassioned freedom fighter in a street gang, becomes ensnared in a convoluted plot as an informant after being tricked into admitting his guilt by association for an Israeli's murder. The major theme is betrayal, found everywhere, informing every life.Scaling the giant separation wall running through occupied Palestine to visit Nadja, however, is less scary than the torture Israelis inflict on him and the betrayal they demand. How he will free himself when he is caught in a covert action is the thriller part of the story.Taking the pretzel plot one step further is the trickery of getting Omar to be an informant and the torturous path he must take as the tries to play both sides. Indeed, moments occur when the audience may not be sure which side Omar is on as he fights for his life and his love. No matter, family and nationalism will be major players in his fate.The film is a powerful screed against the tactics and dominance of Israelis and a simple Shakespearean-like tale of loyalty, love, and jealousy. With the exception of Waleed Zuaiter as Agent Rami, because the actors are new to acting, they bring naturalism to the all-too-real conflict. The narrow alleys through which Omar races aptly represent the dangerous nature of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Neither Nablus nor Nazareth is filmed in any glamorous way. With the impressive claustrophobic compositions and sets, outside and inside, the director has even more skillfully shown through his star-crossed lovers that this war in not over for soldiers or lovers anytime soon:""I believe that in the long run, separation between Israel and the Palestinians is the best solution for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."" Yitzhak Rabin",negative
Omar,"To start with, I want to admit that I might be biased, as this movie is a local movie, with local actors, and local financing. Therefore, my review could be affected by what is so called local patriotism.Nevertheless, I think that this movie is the best movie that I've watched in a long while. This movie tells the story of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict from the Palestinian point of view in a way that no movie did before. Yet, this movie could apply to any weak side that is living under oppression, anywhere on earth, such that everyone that has a heart can empathize with the oppressed, that is symbolized by the hero Omar. In addition, this movie contains numerous elements that one looks for in a movie: it has action scenes, dramatic events of betrayal and honesty, a pure and naive love story, friendship, funny scenes, and above all, it makes the audience ask questions and think. To conclude, this movie is a must watch as it tells a story in a moving manner (some people even cried at the end..). In addition, by watching it you'll be supporting the uprising of the Palestinian movie scene, that has many great talents.",positive
Mucize,"First, let me list what I liked about this film. The setting is beautiful. Stark natural beauty of mountainous Eastern Turkey is breathtaking. Cinematography is also top notch. Local costumes, especially of the women are colorful, authentic and gorgeous. The subject matter, a city-bred grade school teacher is assigned to a remote mountain village where he assumes the self assigned task of rehabilitating a local spastic young man, has the potential of being developed into a powerful story. However, that is where my disappointment starts. The film blows the chance of being a masterpiece. The story development is choppy and full of unlikely events. At several points, I found myself asking 'but, why?' or 'how come?' and finding no explanation. The 'miracle' that is revealed at the end of the movie is probably the one plot element that is least believable. When the villagers wonder how the 'miracle' came about, the main character's explanation, 'I fell in love with my wife', just does not cut it. I admire the young Turkish director, Mahsun Kirmizigul, due to his productivity and improvement in his directing skills he has mustered over the years. Never the less, I believe he still has quite a distance to cover in order to perfect his artistry in story telling.",negative
Mucize,"This is my first review on IMDb. I loved many films but in no case was so motivated to write a review ! I went to ""Mucize"" (Miracle) with little bits expectations but I was truly overwhelmed with this superb story of Mahsun Kirmizigul. I can not remember another movie where I have cried more then this! It is about people who loves other people without expectations. It is about courage of a man who only wants that children go to school and therefore he moves from his city to a place what you can call ""the middle of nowhere""...It is about love what is defined as the key for reach your target...the film looks like real life. All of the characters have played very well but there is one person who have played his role SUPERB ! That is the crazy man : Aziz (Mert Turak) ! The character who plays te handicapped man with a truly amazing emotional bond with his horse. ( I have read somewhere that he has been lived 3 months with the horse to make this possible). He plays the character so perfect that I thought that he really was crazy / handicapped ! In the first half of the movie are so many good jokes that you can think it's a comedy. In the second half the film transforms in a emotional roller-coaster what's putting you in a story that is no more forgettable in your whole live ! A person, who is saying I own a heart, will cry ! There are also more Turkish films like, Eskiya (now in the top 250 of IMDb), babam ve oglum etc. what I can say they were very good but this peace of cinema from early singer Mahsun Kirmizigul is near PERFECT ! See it to believe it. 10 stars out of 10 !",positive
Comet,"One of the most pretentious movies I have ever watched. The main guy character is an unlikable, self-important asshat right from the start, in a way that should be obvious to everybody - except, apparently, the main girl character. She likes it, goes right along with his ""I'm the smartest man alive"" schtick, and delivers some crazy chick attitude in return. The writers worked hard to make narcissistic, sociopathic character traits appear quirky and cute. They're not. They're narcissistic and sociopathic. Couple that with clumsy exposition, wooden dialogue, and wannabe ""aha!"" moments, and it all turns into a major trainwreck. I'm guessing the actors did the best with what they were given to work with. However, the result should appear highly unlikable to any human being with a shred of actual empathy. Comet is a movie that looks good on paper, but unfortunately, does not deliver on its promise at all. Unless we're supposed to find these two painfully annoying, in which case, congratulations.",negative
Comet,"Hollywood movies rarely move me as the formula used is predictable, with most endings being predictable shortly into the film. If you are looking for the Americana white picket fence house in the suburbs, two kids and a dog relationship this is not for you. Comet is a statement on love between two people looking for love who have the unsocial ability to speak their mind, the truth. Truth hurts, and without the ""skills"" to cushion their raw feelings they do hurt each other. Its a beautiful refreshing approach to viewing a relationship, magically crafted by the filmmakers by interweaving the 6 year timeline of their relationship leading up to the final scenes. A film to show this narrative needed two actors who could bring the characters to life and make you believe, outstandingly accomplished by Justin Long and Emmy Rossum. Please realize most of this entire film is carried by these two actors, the supporting cast is small but excellent, the cinematography is captivatingly beautiful, and the musical score integrated perfectly, adding up to a great movie experience. I gave this film a 10, which I never do, to counterbalance the rating of people who obviously did not take the time to take this journey. Don't missed out on relating a few stokes of your life's colour brush to this painting..",positive
Bangalore Days,"Seriously, this movie is overrated. Nothing really happens in this movie. We've got three cousins and we're shown how they're spending their time. Each of them have got problems of their own and they try to sort it out. The acting is sub par with the only good performance done by Fahadh Faasil. Nivin pauly tries hard in comedy but does not succeed much. Dulquer tries to look menacing but does not come up to the mark. Nazriya is really bad. The story turns melodramatic and songs are there for no reason. Songs were actually good, but there is no context for these songs in the movie. And what's with putting the setting as Bangalore? Seriously, this story could've taken place in any of the cities of India. Kochi would've been fine. I won't say this is a complete failure. It is only overrated. If you have nothing else to do and is ready to see a movie which is all style and no substance, then watch this movie.",negative

Xi you: Xiang mo pian,"Warning: Spoilers This movie is a disaster with its horribly random script, flat characters, terrible CGI, and an unbelievable romance.So let's talk SCRIPT. This should be easy, because there isn't one. The story follows the exploits of a young demon hunter as he hunts down three demons: water and pig demon, and the Monkey King. There is no set up to each encounter as the title character Xuan Zang tends to show up out of the blue, do battle, fail, and get saved by a better demon hunter Miss Duan. That's how each fight transpires from start to finish over the course of a 2 hour movie. We never really learn much about the title characters or a handful of minor characters who randomly appear and disappear. The whole movie and the threat of these demons is just glossed over for special effect and battle pieces that get rather boring by the end of the film.Xuan Zang is the lead—a demon hunter who believes in reforming demons rather than killing them, but we never learn why. There are no flashbacks or character development to lead us to understand why he thinks so differently about the monsters. He's a typical Chow innocent, almost exactly like Chow's character in a dozen of his previous movies. He is horrible at what he does until the end when he finally rises to the occasion.Second central character is Miss Duan (the love interest). She appears to help him out against the water demon and then appears out of nowhere when he tries to fight the pig demon. All we know about her is that she isn't an innocent as she kills whoever steps in her path and doesn't know how to flirt or express herself without using her fist. She travels the world with her sister and a couple hired goons that we only see once in a prolonged sequence in the middle of the movie. Like everyone else in this movie we never learn enough about them to care.I understand this is a comedy/action/fantasy movie, but enough character background and development has to be done for us to root for them and sadly, there wasn't. When people start to die at the end—you don't care.The CGI is laughably bad. I'll be honest, during the sequence with the water demon (by far the best part of the whole film) the effects looked great. The water demon looked fantastic, but the pig, the green screen sets, and the over-the-top ending are just so cartoon and obviously fake that it takes away from the film.One of the biggest problems for the film is the forced romance between the central characters. There is no chemistry between them. Miss Duan follows Xuan Zang to each of his encounter with the demons to ensure his safety and when the battle is over tries to get him to confess he loves her, which is something he never does until the ending. She gets rejected, if I remember correctly, 3 or 4 times before (SPOILER WARNING) he finally admits to loving her for 10,000 years as she dies! This romance had about as much heat and passion in it as Twilight. I couldn't believe how flat and forced it was with no payoff.But there are more crimes against this movie which just annoyed me to no end—blatant stealing of items from other Stephen Chow movies. Now part of me believes that Stephen Chow didn't direct this whole movie—in fact, you can see that there are two directors.The Water Demon sequence is about 15 to 20 minutes long and is on a beautifully constructed set—similar to the one found in Kung Fu Hustle. The humor here is excellent, the camera shots, the tension, the drama, everything works perfectly. I was thrilled to be watching one of my favorite Chinese directors hit his mark and exceed. However, after that sequence and a short encounter with Xuan Zang's teacher, Buddha in earthly form, the film falls apart and the ripping off begins. Here are some examples: 1.) The Nursery Rhyme Book: in this film, Xuan Zang uses a book of nursery rhymes in an attempt to bring out the goodness in the demons. Other demon hunters laugh at him and mock him from using it, which later turns out to be a very powerful weapon against the Monkey King. In Kung Fu Hustle it's the same thing—main character buys a book of Kung Fu from a guy, everyone thinks it's a joke, but later on he realizes how to use and becomes a great Kung Fu master.2.) The score from this movie comes from Kung Fu Hustle.3.) Prince Important uses magic swords to fight in the exact same way as the blind music killers from Kung Fu Hustle.4.) (SPOILERS) Buddha kills the Monkey King with the Palm Stephen Chow's character in Kung Fu Hustle used to defeat the villain.All these factors lead me to believe that Stephen Chow directed the first part and was basically helping with the film rather than directing. If I am wrong, then it's a sad day when you see such comedic genius fall so far from grace. If you want to see a hilarious Stephen Chow movie about the Journey to the West see his old movies instead.The last thing I will mention is the endingoh man, what a joke! (SPOILERS) In the end, the three demons join our main character as he travels to the west to spread the word of Buddha—but why would you want to see the continued adventures of a demon who ate a little girl, a demon that had a hotel used to lure travelers so he could eat them, or a Monkey King who ripped a guy's throat out and killed the main characters love?",negative
Xi you: Xiang mo pian,"Fortunately, the movie packs Stephen Chow's comedic style, or I would call it contains his soul. There's Chow's usual style of comedy, action, love story, and some meaning behind life. Well, what more is needed in a blockbuster movie? Unfortunately, nothing is perfect. I went into the cinema without any expectation, and I didn't read any reviews so I could enjoy the whole movie as if I was the first to do so. I understand that Chow directed this movie, and even demonstrated to retain the ""feel"" of his usual style. Still, I find the first 15 minutes of the movie to be a little dry in terms of humor. As the protagonist enters the scene it was a bit difficult for me to laugh. However, as the story unfolds, and as the mainstream humor pours in, laughter floods the cinema wave after another. To add, the protagonist's wacky hair style, does resemble Chow in some ways.The CGI is of top quality, I can see the movie spending a lot of money on CGI. Many of the scenes contain a lot of visual detail and picturesque grounds. The music is familiar and lovely, I shall not reveal too much.Show Luo's appearance in this movie was like his usual funny-self in his TV entertainment news. I would appreciate it more if he would have neglected his usual style and adopted a new one. It's not a bad thing, but it's not a good thing too, it lies somewhere on the neutral side. I guess on the good side, his fans will love to see him.Trying my best not to disclose too much. This movie is a prequel to his previous 2 part movie, ""A Chinese Odyssey Part One: Pandora's Box, and A Chinese Odyssey Part Two: Cinderella."" The essence of this movie is how it somehow relates to ""A Chinese Odyssey"" in terms of how life is, in its cycle. The feelings the protagonist experienced in this movie is similar to what his disciple experienced in ""A Chinese Odyssey"". The good news for those who haven't seen ""A Chinese Odyssey"", is that you can watch this movie on its own.Lastly, there are some tear-jerking scenes. My eyes welled up at some parts, but I stayed a man. I would give this a 9.5 out of 10 because of its imperfection, but the scores only allow whole numbers. So.... enjoy the movie.",positive
Ain't Them Bodies Saints,"I'm on the fence with this one. I don't hate it quite so much as to give it one star, as I'm tempted to. The direction and photography feel like a year 10 high school project. True beauty is best captured inconspicuously on film, whereas Saints is obsessed with getting the perfect shot of shivering fir trees and fields of barley coated in gold at sunset - there's no nuance or subtlety to it. It appears ham fisted when the director is obviously choosing his shots carefully, but when he lets intuition guide him he manages to capture some great moments on film.Like one scene where Rooney Mara's character leaves church, and the local sheriff gives her a tip of a hat outside in a short tracking shot to the tune of a quirky soundtrack - it's simple and effective. Most viewers won't even remember that tiny twenty second scene and are probably too busy salivating over Casey Affleck's felt hats and film student mise en scene. That being said, while the photography is desperate to impress, the way scenes play out is more effective. The director has some idea of how to generate tension, but at times he flops. The opening action sequence is one example; boring, flat, over quickly. Though perhaps what success there is is more to the credit of the screenwriter than the director, it's hard to say.Flaws to one side, there are several small, tender moments that elevate Saints. For example, the interactions between Rooney Mara's character and her daughter, which are, at times, heartwarming, and very natural. Ben Foster too, feels well-casted and is careful not to turn his small town sheriff character into a walking cliché. In fact, he did so well you barely noticed him at all. He blends perfectly into the background. Casey Affleck seemed to recycle his character from ""The Killer Inside Me,"" but his performance was tolerable.So, all in all, Saints makes a lot of swings for few runs, succeeding just enough to be an honourable mention. I understand this is one of the director's first works, so for a debut it is certainly noteworthy. If he can learn to stop grovelling at the feet of critics he may improve in the future.",negative
Ain't Them Bodies Saints,"Enjoyed ""Ain't Them Bodies Saints"". Good story which needs some touching up, but the acting is first rate. It is a character study, a study in melancholy told in real, human terms and not in movie terms. And maybe that is its only flaw, that truth be told, real life is less dramatic and more grimy than make-believe. Briefly, he is a crook, she is his wife/girl (it's not explained) and the two are caught in a shoot-out with police. She fires a gun wildly out a window and accidentally hits a policeman. He takes the rap, goes to jail, she has a baby and waits for him to come back.The nominal star, at least when the movie credits rolled, is Casey Affleck, but the real star is Rooney Mara, who is excellent as the single mom waiting for Affleck. It is an earthy, sensitive portrayal of a distrustful woman on the defensive. She has made great strides since ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"", a one-dimensional performance. The raw-boned Affleck plays tougher than he looks and underplays his role here. Keith Carradine was a surprise in a strong supporting role.In my opinion the picture could use two things; tightening up and punching up. There are some dead spots throughout and the film seems longer than 105 minutes, although, as I said, real life is not always supercharged. But there must be a middle ground or else the narrative becomes sluggish. Also, no explanation was given for the 3 strangers in town. Were they Magi? The Three Stooges? We are left to wonder, and director Lowery should have given us more information in this instance.It is very worth seeing and brightens a dreary summer full of sequels and explosion movies. If you are seeking respite from the likes of ""Smurfs 2"", go see this one. It's for grown ups.",positive

It's not a movie one can remember forever like KAL HO NA HO or DDLJ. the story of success and failure of stardom is very old. Giving up life for your loved one is not really a solution.

Dilwale,It is hilarious to see the first 4 pages of reviews of Dilwale has a 10* rating which was rather surprising to me. So I go in to the profile of each of those people and there you have it most of the reviewers had joined IMDb in Dec and this is the only movie they have rated.It is just sad when movie makers have to create fake profiles and rate the movie high so the public would fall for it and watch the movie. But this is such a sad strategy as we can not be fooled for long.I wanted to check the reviews first before watching the movie but thankfully the real reviews from real people have told me exactly what i needed to know!,negative
Dilwale,The script for this was written by a 6 year old who watched too many Hollywood. That is the only way I can interpret this movie. More that half of this movie is CARS and then some Michael Bay sh*t. The song locations or songs not make any sense.I like SRK and Kajol as couple but I never expected that they will act in such a movie. Even half the dialogs were reference to other movies. The action scenes were too short for enjoyment. If you go too deep in movie for logic (I always do because I want good logic in a good movie) then you will bang your head against the wall.My conclusion is that if you are looking to waste 2h 38m of your time and to see the return of SRK and Kajol jodi then go watch the film. But if you're looking for a good story or at least a logical film then really don't waste your money or your time. Thank you!,positive
Bajirao Mastani,"One of the best performance by Bansali Sir Ever . Project it as the third spin off from a trilogy started from Hum dil de chuke sanam and Devdas where Salman and Shahrukh Stealed the show , but here Deepika did .Ranveer and Priyanka were lovely to watch but Deepika was far better . Belonging to such a strong and non-entertaining genre , it did entertained us and I will highly recommend you to watch this .Some may have rated it down (Fan wars or something) but believe me , it will show a spike and gradually may end up around 8 or something .Deserves your bucks and after watching it , you will for sure oblige Bhansali Sir to the magic he brought back that was missing from Bollywood for the past few years .Story 9/10 Songs 9/10 Dialogues 10/10 Acting 9/10 Direction 10/10Overall 9/10",negative
Bajirao Mastani,"This movie had already garnered expectations of epic proportions due to the cast, crew and the director, Mr. Sanjay Leela Bhansali. This movie had been in the making for over a decade and hence had already created ample curiosity in the moviegoers minds. After watching the movie, I was at a loss of words. I don't even know where to begin! The music, screenplay, acting, dialogues and the beautiful story of 3 complex characters - everything is magnificent and spectacular! This movie is poetry in motion, easily one of the most epic tales in Indian history being translated in such a classy yet relatable manner on screen! Each scene and each dialogue gets the viewers completely hooked! People were involved and taken back into the 18th century - such was the appeal of the movie! The acting is PHENOMENAL! Ranveer Singh has always delivered fabulous performances, but this performance will be remembered until the end of his career as the performance that catapulted him into the hearts of the Indian cinema lovers. He has done a beyond brilliant job and as a viewer, we laugh, cry and root for him throughout the movie! He's the out and out star of the film. Priyanka Chopra is her usual magnificent self, nothing else can be expected of her after delivering award winning performances in Barfi and Mary Kom. She lights up the scenes she's in. It's amazing how she's good at dance, acting and emoting on screen! Her pain as Bajirao's first wife is captivating and makes the viewers feel for her! What else can be said about the ruling queen of Bollywood, Deepika Padukone, that hasn't already been written!! She is a spectacle all by herself! She makes us cry, laugh, weep, and look at her in awe! She's fabulous in the kathak number, ""mohe rang do laal"" and she shines in every scene of the film! Especially in the scene where she meets kashibai and in the scene where she is jailed! Her eyes are truly the window to Mastani's soul! She matches Ranveer''s energy and their chemistry is undoubtedly historic and classic! What fabulous acting! The supporting cast is a marvel in itself, Tanvi Azmi as Bajirao's mother is fantastic! Her acting abilities are par excellence, couldn't have imagined anyone else in that role! The music, costumes, scenery, sets and decor are exquisite! Nothing less can be expected from an SLB film! This movie is easily one of the top 5 cinema experiences in the past 10 years! It excels in both content and creativity! I will definitely be watching the movie again, it's simply addictive and outstanding and leaves a lasting impression on the viewers mind. A 10/10 experience! Loved it.",positive
Dil Dhadakne Do,"Look of film is rich as their characters but they behave like a typical middle class family. I could have accepted it with few ones but every one!!!! Then what was the need to show them upper class!? Cruise thing was just stuffed to add some grandeur in film and it adds but nothing to add any entertainment or any good use of it in film plot except in boring way in climax. Writer and director had taken audiences for granted as if they belong to the family, whose story is being told. Lots of character confuse audience to understand the movie. There are very few emotional scenes and that too are mixed with some quirky humour so nothing comes to audience very clearly. There are few good emotional scenes, precisely shot actually, Neelam Mehara eating cake while crying, Anil Kapoor grabs Rahul Bose neck. Love track doesn't have any scene to mention. Its narrative style from the dog perspective doesn't appeal. Film bores and length makes it more boring. Performance wise Anil Kapoor and Shefali Shah as Neelam Mehra are very good. Rest are just OK. Music also bores as the lyrics.",negative
Dil Dhadakne Do,"The people who are saying this movie is not good clearly don't know anything about films.Dil Dhhadakne do is one of my favourite films.It is inspiring,beautiful,funny and just a full package.The film has a soul and is just a masterpiece from the director Zoya Akhtar.",positive
Frantz,"Diane and I viewed this brilliant film yesterday at Fremantle's art cinema and we both shared the absolute same high regard for the wonderful film that we had just seen. The film was so rich in cinematography, dialogue, acting and scripting that both of us were totally absorbed in this cinematic experience. I am old to the point where I have difficulty following subtitles: either they are too quick so that I can't read them before they disappear or they are too small and in the wrong print colour for this film they were perfect. The print was not too small, too fast or the wrong colour so for an old guy the visuals were perfection personified. As to the substance of the film's script, the action takes place two years after the end of WW I and involves two soldiers who met during the war and the family of one of these soldiers after the war. The drama is intense and its intricacies are sobering and manifest. A film to anticipate and make every effort to attend.",negative
Frantz,"The eponymous character is a cultured, pacifist, loving German young man whose doctor father urged him to fight for the fatherland. He gets the title because his spirit haunts the film — as the heroine Anna's lost love, as the Hofmeisters' lost son and as the kindred spirit his killer, the French solider Adrien, comes to love through his family and their memories. Himself another cultured, pacifist, loving young man, Adrien seeks out Frantz's grave and family to seek forgiveness for having killed him, albeit in the trenches. As he is so much like Frantz he wins over Anna and Frantz's parents and in turn becomes properly enamoured with her. Though Frantz and Adrien only met in that fatal trench, the narrative posits them as potentially dear friends, perhaps even lovers. That potential was dashed by the war.Adrien's relationship with Anna is based on his lie: that he was Frantz's dear friend, not his killer. When he tells Anna that truth she hides it from Frantz's parents, to spare them further pain and disillusionment. They cling to the illusion he will replace their son by marrying Anna and reviving Frantz' violin. To preserve their illusion Anna stays in Paris and reports living with Adrien. In a sane world Frantz and Adrien would have lived the lie to which Adrien retreated: they would have met in Paris and become fast friends. They might've competed for Anna on an equal footing. But not in this world. As Frantz's father reminds his war-mongering compatriots, fathers send their sons off to war. Though the nations blame each other, it's the fathers' responsibility when the lads are killed. The film's most obvious theme is how war needlessly fractures the brotherhood of man. After the war the Germans still hate the French, the victorious French the Germans. The hatred renews itself. Set in 1919, the entire drama of renewal and loss plays out under our knowledge that WW II lies ahead. The German discontent and French complacency will shortly reignite with even more catastrophic consequences. If Frantz shadows the scene from the past, the next war looms in the future.In addition to war, the film is about the equally difficult issues of how to live a full and honourable life. In peace as in war we're challenged to balance truthfulness with the empathetic lie. Thus Anna tells Adrien she has revealed his lie and guilt to the Hofmeisters. But she hasn't, preferring to save them the renewed pain and another disillusionment. To the end she sustains their illusion that she is living a full life in Paris with Adrien, not wasting away in grief for their Frantz. Where Adrien's lie served himself, hers serves them.The last scene promises a happy ending, her lie coming true, when she meets another version of Adrien, a fragile lookalike, in the Louvre. As young men on either side are interchangeable as cannon fodder in the war, young men can replace each other in civilian life when their mothers send them off to marriage. Tragically, Adrien doesn't resist his mother's assignment of Fanny, as Frantz couldn't resist his father's dispatch to war. But with the spirit of life a heart can survive death and loss. A new love can replace a lost. Until the next war, of course, which could well make her a widow, him a casualty.But that may be the film's most compelling theme: the importance of carrying on with hope and life. Hofmeister means master of hope. Through their mutual attraction Anna and Adrien snap each other out of their emotional paralysis, whether from guilt or grief. They bring each other to life. But as any war story inevitably requires compromise here they can't have each other. They have to settle for other mates. From Frantz letter on to the visits to the Louvre, the film returns to the Manet painting, The Suicide. A pallid thin man flings back across the bed dead, evoking both Frantz and Adrien — and Anna, who tried to drown herself after losing her illusion of Adrien too. In Manet's image off a despairing passionate death Anna finds encouragement to live.One of the film's strengths is its detailed realization of the period, not just in setting and costume but in conversation, tone, values and understanding. Especially in the black and white sequences, the film feels like a document of the 1920s, the period between the great, the terrible, wars. The periodic suffusions of colour serve two functions: they provide an emotional heightening to those particular scenes and they remind us that the film is as much about today as about its historical setting. Perhaps today the bloody fractures involve different nations, and different cultures at war within any of our present nations. But the dashing of hopes and fidelities continues.",positive
Bareilly Ki Barfi,"For me, I was actually enjoying the movie. But not the ending...
I liked the main actor's character at first, looked and acted very decent until the character unravels. He is only decent around the girl but his heart is not. I do not think he deserve to be with the girl. I mean the last scene was so cringe when Chirag was happy and telling Pritam that Pritam taunted Chirag so much (basically like a week I bet!)...and they both laughed as it was so hilarious or something (and we forget that Chirag bullied Pritam for 5 years or so..lol)**they were not even friends, movie narrator even said 'mu bola dost'Chirag also said he learned his lessons (as being a selfless human) because he wants the girl (Bitti) to be happy. So, he would let her marry Pritam.
Well, same thing happened with his first love? He lets her marry off with another guy.. he was crying and all. So, what did he learn that time then?Also about Pritam's life. All the mental and physical abuse Chirag did. No one is going to talk about it? Felt so bad for the poor guy.**Lastly they become friends for real? sure :3(Just shared my personal opinion, I watched this movie lightly, sorry, that my comment isn't light enough)peace",negative
Bareilly Ki Barfi,"How often you watch a Movie which is so well and solidly written that the characters are tremendously real. The actors portraying those roles they appear utmost genuine and authentic to the audience. Well, Bareilly Ki Barfi is one such movie. Set in the small town of Barielly (Uttar Pradesh) we get introduced to the characters within five - ten minutes of the movie playing by the Voice - Over/Narrator (thanks to Javed Akhtar). We get introduced to Mishra Family, Father (Mr. Narottam Mishra) played superbly and excellent by Pankaj Mishra. Mom (played brilliantly by Seema Pahwa) and Bitti (played excellently by Kriti Sanon). They have a sweet shop just attached to their home which is run by Narottam Mishra. Seema Pahwa is a teacher in a primary school and Bitti Mishra works in Power Sub - Station like a Customer Care or Support Executive answering and attending phone calls. Hats off to Ashwini Iyer Tiwari for beautifully portraying the relationship between father and daughter (Pankaj Mishra and Kriti Sanon respectively). I mean how often in Bollywood Movies you see father borrowing a cigarette from his daughter, and on top of that he gives all that space and liberty to his daughter. Bitti's mother too remains suspicious and revolting for her daughter and her actions. Worried still that she may never get married after being rejected twice. Bitti later on finds support and solace in an nondescript and inconspicuous novel published by a Printing Press owner (Chirag Dubey played remarkably well by Ayushmaan Khurrana). The Novel's Title and Film's are Namesake. Bitti after reading the novel correlates with our own self like all the habits which she had bear a stark similarity with the female protagonist in the Novel. She gets smitten and falls in love with the Author of the Novel - Bareilly Ki Barfi. Here is the twist in the story. Even though Author of the Novel is none another than Chirag Dubey (Ayushmaan Khurrana) himself, who is heart - broken as his first love affair ended in a tragedy and was a disaster believes and fears that there will be backlash from women in the society and also his first love will be dishonored. Having said that, he asks his close friend Pritam Vidrohi (played ultimately well by Rajkummar Rao) to publish his name and photograph at the back of the Novel and credit him as the Author of the Novel. Pritam reluctantly agrees, but immediately after leaves Bareilly and settles in Lucknow by managing a job at a Saree Store. In the meanwhile Chirag falls in love with Bitti. On the other hand Bitti asks Chirag to fix up a meeting with Pritam and she desperately wants to meet him. In this era of Whatsapp, Facebook, Messenger who cares for hand written letters. They are a thing of bygone era. But wait, Writer and Director (Nitesh Tiwari and Ashwini Iyer Tiwari) bring this bygone thing and portray it to immaculate perfection onto the screen. Bareilly Ki Barfi is very simple and ordinary love story or I will say Love Triangle, but narrated, portrayed and enacted brilliantly and flawlessly. Also, take a look at the characters, they are so real and sincerely true in their emotions, behaviors, mannerisms. Right from the first frame to the moment when the end credits roll along, you as audience tend to flow with the narrative and in fact try to identify and associate with all of the characters. This is the power of script and screenplay and not to mention the direction. Must watch specially if you believe in good, clean and wholesome cinema.",positive
Indignation,"We watched this at home on DVD. We both enjoyed the movie.It is about a young Jewish student from Newark, NJ. It is 1951, in the shadow of the Korean War, and he goes off to college to a conservative school in Ohio. He is a serious student, very intelligent and very sure of his stance on assorted issues. Like religion, even though his upbringing is Jewish he considers himself an Atheist.INDIGNATION: anger or annoyance provoked by what is perceived as unfair treatment.And that is largely what the story is about. The student is Logan Lerman as Marcus. He wants to be left alone, his two roommates are annoying, and he also finds the Jewish fraternity guys annoying, he wants nothing to do with them. He wants to spend his time on study and work, he has no time for frivolous pursuits.For me the highlight of the whole movie is the scene in the office of the Dean of Men who called Marcus in for a chat after Marcus requested a different room. The thrust of the Dean's discussion is if young Marcus always flees disagreement instead of working things out, a skill needed in the real world. As the DVD extra points out, this scene runs rather long, about 13 pages of script, where the usual guidance limits a scene to about 3 pages of script. But the scene works wonderfully, we get to peek inside young Marcus and see what really makes him tick. Both actors, Lerman and Tracy Letts as Dean Caudwell, are remarkably good.The love interest is played by Sarah Gadon as very pretty student Olivia Hutton, who takes a liking to young Marcus and shows him some of the less obvious pleasures of boy-girl encounters. Overall a very fine movie with superb acting.SPOILERS: The movie actually opens and closes in the present time, an older Olivia is in a special care facility, as we saw in the 1950s she had some emotional issues and slit her wrists at least once. Back in 1950s young Marcus objected to the requirement that he accumulate at least 40 hours in Chapel, and eventually paid someone to go for him and fill out the card with Marcus' name. But they were both caught, Marcus was expelled, he entered the draft and was killed in Korea.",negative
Indignation,"Indignation simply means anger provoked by something perceived as unfair treatment and that's what happens to the main lead Marcus in this Phillip Roth beautiful adaptation. I would say there are three main reasons to watch this amazing movie.1. Thought Provoking themes and survival in a society where there exists no individuality - Stating it simply this film proves even its set in 1950s society don't follow good with change. Marcus played by Lerman considers himself to be an atheist and wants to stay that way. There are many things which he finds difficult to chose from like joining jew fraternity club, love life ,sexual awakening, relationship with his father , conversation with Dean of college.Unable to conform to these changes his life deteriorates and it's something that anyone who doesn't go all the way with beliefs of society and very well understand.All this is represented very beautiful manner. I don't want to say much about the themes as you should watch it yourself to draw meaning from them .I was wondering that the way in which the film started it must be going somewhere , it went and delivered more than I expected. The themes it tackles especially of individual freedom and independence is something even many people struggle in today's society. The was society wants you to make them their carbon copy only makes it harder. Apart from that the film also takes a genuine take on Human Character like Marcus Father worrying about him or How the slit wrist mark on Marcus love interest was not seen by him as he has no intention of that type but was quickly seen by his mother which at that moment hated her stating it's her weakness that will drown Marcus which I strongly object to. There are far more things and if you are an atheist it's of your interest.2. The Great Dialogues and Quotes - This film is filled with so much engaging and deeper meaning dialogues. Although I haven't read any work of Roth , I find these dialogues and quotes a rare offering from the Cinema. With all its deeper meanings and delights it hits you right and the heart and the brain. There is Great 10-15 minutes long conversation between Marcus and Dean and I really like it as I too doesn't have belief in God. The whole conversation was like a debate where everything had a counter answer and although for me Marcus won , whatever he said is embedded in my mind for its logic and clarity. For example when Marcus told Dean he is atheist ,Dean told Millions believe in god why?. Marcus said - Millions once believe Earth was flat. That's something and the film is filled with more of this.3. Performance In my opinion cast did a good job but especially this was best career performance by Logan Lerman of Percy Jackson fame . This surpasses his incredible performance of Perks of being a wallflower.This movie is a rare offering by Cinema directly reflecting on life and individuality even though set in 1950s , it highly corresponds to today's time too.",positive
And So It Goes,". . . from one of the most frenetic birthing scenes since GONE WITH THE WIND to graphic footage of butterfly reproduction. AND SO IT GOES from the dope house to the prison cell, featuring characters who have real life jobs and problems. Since the action is set and filmed in Connecticut, there are none of those ubiquitous palm trees that mar so many Hollywood pictures shot in California and other Southern states. When things look bleakest in this tale, baseball comes to the rescue. Violence and animal abuse are kept to a minimum, as the main action sequence involves an ""Oopsie!"" on a slip-and-slide. AND SO IT GOES from second chances to third or fourth tries, with every well-developed character serving a purpose. Aging actress Diane Keaton gets to laugh, cry, and croon about a dozen Golden Oldies, while the geriatric Michael Douglas proves he's still fit enough to carry a skinny 10-year-old girl at least 12 feet. AND SO IT GOES.",negative
And So It Goes,"If you were told to watch a movie directed by Rob Reiner, starring Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton, with a budget of $30 mil. you could think that you are about to experience a movie with powerful emotions and an interesting plot.Actually, in the end, this is a rather simple movie and its course is obvious from the beginning.Michael Douglas plays Oren Little, a realtor who's about to retire after he makes his last sale, and Diane Keaton plays his singer next-door neighbor. What will happen between them is to be seen (I won't spoil it for you) but I'm pretty sure you have already guessed.The acting from the 2 veteran actors is effortless but the direction from the once-mighty Rob Reiner is too simple and targeting more for a few easy laughs if nothing else. Note that Reiner is also in the movie as the pianist who plays for Diane Keaton's character.It's a dramedy more than just a comedy but even the dramatic elements are more likely to promote laughter, if not anything else.There a couple of good songs sang by Keaton (?) and you also get to see Grease's Frankie Valli in a cameo appearance.Overall: It's OK. Douglas/Keaton are fun to watch, but don't expect greatness.",positive
Dear White People,"I watched,with great pain,the pitifully biased and nonsensical film that attempted to elevate the discourse on real racism and its presence in our world. Well funded and full of passion,it simply shows whites as the worst people,ever. The black people in the film,ironically,came off just one half a notch less awful. Im a glass half full type,so I have more optimism than the cynic that penned this thing,but the answer to this problem is NOT to write a film that portrays whites as whiskey drinking KKK types with greasy hair and hate in their hearts. The only answer is truth. Pursue it. This is NOT the truth. Just a slant.",negative
Dear White People,Dear makers of this movie - little tip; if you want to attract an audience - try to come up with a title that doesn't alienate your watchers into eye rolling territory. It is a terrible strategy based on pseudo-moralistic far left ideas that are already unpalatable.,positive
The Two Faces of January,"'The to faces of January' is an old-fashioned, decent thriller with a nice sixties setting and solid acting. Everything about it is immaculate. The plot is intelligent enough: a couple of rich tourists meet a young American tour guide, who accidentally witnesses the husband committing a crime. One thing leads to another, and soon enough the guide is caught in a web of lies and deceit, and it becomes impossible to escape without incriminating himself. The crime story is spiced up by the mutual romantic attraction between the guide and the young wife. There is even a sort of life lesson included: money is the root of all evil. The movie is well worth seeing, if only because it is nice to see a film that's not experimental, violent, provocative, filled with special effects or in one way or another trying to be hip or trendy. I can see why so many reviewers make references to Hitchcock. The film is set in the early sixties, the era in which Hitch made some of his best films like 'The Birds' or 'Marnie'. Still, this film lacks the touch of a genius like Hitchcock. The characters have no extra psychological layers, and the unconventional scenes and themes that make the Hitchcock-movies so special, are absent in this film.",negative
The Two Faces of January,"If this movie had been made back in mid-century when Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Donen and Billy Wilder were at their peak, it probably wouldn't get much attention. But given we're in an age where Transformers XVI is a possibility, a movie like this--taut, suspenseful, well-acted, well- written, is kind of a marvel. It doesn't promise a lot: there are no special effects, the plot twists aren't terribly surprising; in fact, nothing in the movie really surprises. But it's all so seamlessly put together, so pleasingly directed, and shot with such loving attention to the scenery, Two Faces is a real delight. Don't come with great expectations--come simply for the pure entertainment of what a movie can be when everything in it works well. (Also, it's based on a Patricia Highsmith novel, so you know that if nothing else, there will be sophistication and wit.)",positive

Bitva za Sevastopol,"Although it's mostly in Russian with subtitles, I was drawn in deeply and remained so throughout the duration. This is the most gripping WW2 film I've seen since Saving Private Ryan. The direction, acting, cinematography are all top notch. It tells the story of heroic Russian sniper without glamorizing war. Instead the horror of war is pervasive and though she is a survivor her story is tragic. It's also very interesting to get a glimpse of Stalin-era Soviet culture.

Think Like a Man Too,Review: I really liked this movie because it shows you that even though Las Vegas is extremely Gotti there is still romantic places you could consider for marriage. The couples including a former player and his current girlfriend who almost steal the show away from everyone else because of his reputation and she having to do damage control. A newly divorced man who thinks he is a player. This cast of characters is perfect to have been roaming around Las Vegas. The director and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. There are some really funny moments such as the guys going to the strip club for amateur night and the girls being the audience. The in jail moment feels as real as it gets based on the couples behaving poorly in the strip club. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.,positive
Barefoot,"so this is actually the second time i watch something for Scott Speedman, the first time i'v watched him was in the Underworld movies when he was serious guy vampire /wolf .. but he really fits in these kinda romance-comedy movies ,, the movie had its moments , some highs and lows ,, the plot is good and new and heartwarming. the script is written in a good way , no complications on following the events. you know when you watch a movie and you feel happy , smiling in a weird way in the end , yeah .. that's one of those. The story itself starts slow and there is some missing ideas and it's not that Hilarious ,, but it still felt nice . the casting was so good. so i think overall the movie worked out pretty well.",negative
Barefoot,"Jay Wheeler (Scott Speedman) lives up to his name as a wheeler-dealer. A son of wealthy New Orleans stock, he has chosen to run up gambling debts and pursue other nefarious actions. This lands him in jail, where he is sentenced to community service at a mental hospital. While mopping the floors, he saves a pretty patient, Daisy (Evan Rachel Wood) from being assaulted by a male resident of the same ward. Not long after this, his gambling totals are so large that the casinos are after him. His only recourse is to go back home for his brother's wedding, where he will ask his father for a ""business loan"". But, needing to look the part of a successful gentleman, Jay decides he needs a lady on his arm. All of the pole dancers of his acquaintance turn him down so he gets the brilliant idea to bring DAISY, after she follows him out the door one night. Is he serious? Yes, she's highly functional but may have killed her mother, also a disturbed individual. With instructions to tell everyone she is a nurse, can Daisy and Jay pull this ruse off? Not likely, and soon other escapades follow. Meanwhile, the hospital's head shrink (JK Simmons) is throwing fit after fit. Is there a future for this strange couple? This remake of a German film has a great concept and a winning performance from Wood to elevate its eventual loss of energy. What fun to have a ""crazy"" woman pose as a gal pal at a high society wedding! Speedman does fine work, too, as do Treat Williams, Simmons, Kate Burton and more. As the scenery goes from California to Louisiana to Texas and back again, fans of varied venues will be happy, too. Yes, the flick slows down and loses focus in the second half but still will resonate with a certain kind of offbeat film lover. So, if that's you, get shoes on and go get Barefoot.",positive
The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Them,"I have just finished watching this movie, and prior to that, the first two that are basically identical, though one from his perspective and the other from her's. The problem I found is that even the first 2 movies (Titles ""The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Him (2013)"" and ""The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Her (2013)"" had too many scenes that aside from the odd word were identical. To then watch this movie, I could find nothing that I had not already seen in the previous 2 movies. In fact, I have to say that 2 of the 3 movies were superfluous with nothing snappy, or fresh...I felt like I watched a very long drawn out movie that only held my attention because of the hype I'd read by previous reviewers here (who should be banned for saying how artistically it was done. Copying something is not artistic. Basically one horrid and boring movie stamped into 3 movies, though from the producers perspective they got to use many of the same film parts, so the cost of production would have been low - 3 for the price of one. As for the acting - below par, even for Eleanor's father played by William Hurt - yes they were all supposedly dysfunctional with a fairly high lacking of communication skills on both sides of the families with each and every character, but they almost all acted as if they were in a severe state of depression - the sister (a blond Jess Weixler) who was supposed to be only 2 yrs younger than Eleanor (Jessica Chastain) (but looks at least 10) was the only one to have any life in her, though she is pretty much a side character so didn't and couldn't have lifted the movie. Yes I get it was supposed to be sad - dead child (which they never in all 3 movies went into detail so we never even found out how the child died at age 2 yrs I think he was - not a single flashback of the child only the 2 main characters)= marriage breakup = angst for everybody +++ (just like in real life for many, so really what was new about this movie, or rather what made it worth watching - I can say for myself it just wasn't worth watching, and that is rare for me to say.",negative

Cuban Fury,"CUBAN FURY is yet another British comedy that isn't very funny. The concept - a workplace love triangle in which our portly hero has to return to his childhood love of salsa in order to win over the hot new American manager from his obnoxious co-worker - is sound but the jokes are too few, the direction is generic and, in a film which is all about dancing, it's all too obvious that Nick Frost as the lead can't actually dance very well. Among the supporting cast Ian McShane is nicely seedy and Kayvan Novak steals the show as a camp Persian fellow-dancer, but there's not enough of them and too much of Nick Frost being clumsy and Chris O'Dowd being a jerk.",negative
Cuban Fury,"After a terrible bullying experience, Bruce Garrett (Nick Frost) has now become an ego-deflated, self-loathing, trapped as a wallflower young engineer who lost all hopes of ever being in love with his only escape is eating at Nando's take-outs. When the arrival of his new boss, an American named Julia (Rashida Jones), his lease on life turns for the better. However, he does feel worthy enough to win her love. His dominant male colleague named Drew (Chris O'Dowd) naturally steps up to the plate to win her heart. Within a twist of irony, she has a very true passion for a man who could dance, particularly salsa dancing, which he is master in that craft. Bruce gets drawn back to the inner demons that has been haunting him for a long time. But through trail and error along with some persuasion from his sister Sam (Olivia Colman), Bruce must regain the dancing skills he once perfected and to try to the win the heart out of Julia up on the dance floor.If you've seen the 1993 ""Strictly Ballroom"", you'll simply enjoy ""Cuban Fury"", a film that juxtaposes the romantic comedy romp along with the art of salsa dancing to keep you both entertained while you hum to the music as the dancing will come after you something fierce. The movie like ""Strictly Ballroom"", has its share of intriguing characters that are both humorous and very effective in their actions and the dialogue. Television director James Griffiths in his movie debut antes up the charm factor with two great performers like Nick Frost and Chris O'Dowd who's charismatic nature about them never keeps the story from becoming mundane. To those who love salsa dancing may sit still on their seats as Frost and O'Dowd will melt your heart in amazement as they will compete against each other and will dance their hearts out as a way to reach their goals to win the heart of Julia. In the in it isn't Bruce or Drew that's the winner, but for the dance enthusiast, it's the audience that's the winner. By the time we get introduced to Nick Frost's character, a bulbous, loner of a man who's now a high-ranking industrial machinery designer who was a salsa dancer expert was haunted 22 years ago from a legion of bullies were on the prowl who made him swallow his costume sequins. But his desire to dance returns once his new boss, Julia enters his life who has a fascination for salsa. A memorable scene was when they were in the corridor and their name tags magnetize together was quite precious. What's also hilarious is that her name is Julio. The real scene stealer is Chris O'Dowd as Bruce's rival who also has the hots for Julia, Drew. He's a jerk who likes to tell dirty jokes and makes seductive passes towards Julia.But it's not just Bruce, Julia and Drew that carry the whole movie. We have Kayvan Novak as Bejan who's also a salsa impresario who encourages Bruce to shave his chest hairs, get a superficial tan and to purchase a silk tan. Olivia Colman who plays Bruces's sister Sam persuades him to relinquish from his comfort zone and takes him to a tavern and gives him some shots where she works while sporting a Polynesian call-girl uniform. Rory Kinnear who plays Bruce's friend Gary who's confused by the situation involving Bruce and Bejan. There's a plethora of great scenes involving Burce and his former salsa dancing coach, Ron Parfitt played by Ian McShane as he get him to regain a talent he lost as he had the ""legs of a stallion and the arms of an eagle"". McShane has great depth along with compelling facial expressions which flows along the film quite nicely. The principal leads are virtually sublime and this film is a dynamic underdog story as Frost tries everything to overcome his inner demons to dazzle us with his one hidden talents with his supreme salsa moves which will likely melt your heart like a hot knife through butter. Jones is quite superb as her natural beauty and charm she's in the middle of Bruce and Drew's competitive ways to win her approval. Watch for a cameo from Simon Pegg in a memorable scene in a parking lot where Bruce and Drew are competing against each other showing off their salsa dancing skills. The climax is very exciting as the two rivals compete on the dance floor and is backed by wonderful music and the adrenaline pulsing sound of the crowd as the heart pounds while the rhythms to the sound will likely sweep you off your feet. You never know this movie may inspire you to want to learn the art of salsa dancing.",positive
Phoenix,"The plot rests on the impossible premise that a friend would not fully disclose one's husband's betrayal. This makes absolutely no sense. I don't want to see you be hurt further by chasing after a lying scumbag of a husband, so I tell you that he betrayed you. I also tell you that he is after your family's money. It seems to me that this is the most difficult reveal, causing pain of course, but necessary pain. Why in the world wouldn't I ALSO show you the proof that he divorced you?The movie inches tediously ahead for hours dependent on this ridiculous plot. One moment of unintentional comic relief: Nelly walks like a depressed Frankenstein for the first half of the movie - one assumes she sustained an injury in the camps that explains her flat footed gait. But, tada! All it takes is one comment from her husband and suddenly she's cured!Even the title is irritating - nothing is redemptive in this movie - what waste of acting talent here.",negative
Phoenix,"""I feel wherever I go, that tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here, and always too soon"" – Speak Low, Kurt Weill and Ogden Nash Just released from Auschwitz, Nelly Lenz's (Nina Hoss) face is disfigured and bandaged as she crosses a checkpoint in Berlin in 1945 with her friend Lene (Nina Kunzendorf), a worker for the Jewish Agency for Palestine. Though Nelly is free to go anywhere, she is encouraged by Lene to move to Haifa, but is reluctant to move on. Based on a novel by Hubert Monteilhet from a screenplay co-written by the director and the late Harun Farocki, Christian Petzold's Phoenix explores the reality of German guilt and the trauma of those who survived, focusing on two people, one who desperately wants to forget the past and the other who is unable to let go of it.Before undergoing restorative surgery, Nelly says, ""I want to look the same as before,"" but it is not to be. Her face is rebuilt but she is now unrecognizable and only a sad reminder of the alluring night club singer she used to be, a shadow who walks ghost-like through the ruins of Berlin searching for her husband Johnny (Ronald Zehrfeld), whose love she claims was the only thing that kept her alive in the dark days. Lene tells her to stay away, that Johnny, a non-Jew, betrayed her to the Nazis and then divorced her, but Nelly refuses to believe it is true. The record shows, however that Johnny was arrested on October 4th and released on October 6th, the same day Nelly was arrested.When she finds the former pianist, now a busboy in a night club named ""The Phoenix,"" he notices that she looks like Nelly but is so convinced that his wife is dead that he cannot give credence to the thought of her survival. Whether he truly does not recognize her or simply cannot confront the role he played in her arrest is uncertain but brings to mind the proverbial saying, ""There are none so blind as those that will not see."" Johnny sees only that Nelly, having lost her family in the war, stands to inherit a small fortune locked away in a Swiss bank. Creating the atmosphere of a Hitchcock-like film noir, Johnny's small, crowded apartment becomes the location where a scheme is hatched in to claim Nelly's money and divide it between them. To that end, Johnny trains her to look, act, and talk like Nelly.The beleaguered woman plays his game, not knowing where it will lead but afraid to tell him the truth. Masterly crafted by Petzold and cinematographer Hans Fromm, Phoenix is marked by stunning performances from Zehrfeld who co-starred in Petzold's last film Barbara, and by Nina Hoss whose haunting performance is unforgettable. Hoss' shattered look, repressed emotions, and shaky voice are so natural that her gradual awakening to the reality of what her life is about truly epitomizes a Phoenix rising from the ashes. Though oddly rejected by both Cannes and Venice, Phoenix may be remembered long after the Festival winners have been forgotten, particularly the film's final scene, a moment that is so resonant and powerful that it may become an important part of film history.",positive
Very Good Girls,"Review: I wasn't that impressed with this dull chick flick about 2 friends who fancy the same man. The two teenagers are desperate to lose there virginity and whilst walking on the beach, they bump into the ice cream boy who they both find quite attractive. One of the girls tries her utmost to get the boys attention while the other girl uses the shy approach. I found the movie quite slow and boring in parts. The acting wasn't that great but I liked the chemistry between the two girls. The director tried to add family elements to try and make it more interesting but I struggled to stay awake. The boy, played by Boyd Holbrook, seemed a bit useless and he kept on popping into to scenes, out of the blue. You also didn't know anything about the boys history so he seemed like a bit of a shady character. Anyway, I didn't really enjoy this film that much but I'm sure that there are many ladies that will get emotional whilst watching it. Unimpressed! Round-Up: Dakota Fanning really had a promising start to her career with movies like Man On Fire, War Of The World's and I Am Sam, but her choice of projects has been her downfall. Movies like Effie Gray, Night Moves and The Motel Life, haven't been that great and it doesn't look like she has anything interesting in the pipeline. Maybe she peaked to early! Her best friend, played by Elizabeth Olsen, is in the new Avengers movie and she also starred in Captain America, Oldboy and Godzilla so she can't complain about her career so far. The problem is that I can't remember seeing her face in any of those movies so she couldn't have made a big impact. Personally I think that she is the best thing in this movie, even though Demi Moore, Richard Dreyfuss, Ellen Barkin and Clark Gregg have cameo roles but they weren't in the movie that much.I recommend this movie to people who are into their emotional dramas about 2 best friends who fancy the same boy. 3/10",negative
Very Good Girls,"I thought this movie was great, it's a good chick flick with sad moments and happy moments in it. This movie was full a great performances mainly by Dakota Fanning. I was surprised about the bad ratings people said about this movie, the movie is average but that doesn't mean it's bad its a good movie to watch with one of your girl-friends that like chick flicks or something that is nice to watch on your own.I highly recommend watching this movie of coming of age girls in New York city who want to lose there virginity over the summer before going into college, I find this movie very interesting that can put tears in your eyes and a smile on your face!",positive

Night Train to Lisbon,"Don't be put off by critics who thought ""Night Train to Lisbon"" was old-fashioned, too talky and lacking in tension, because there is something unique about this movie; by the end, it's quite an experience.Raimund Gregorius, played by Jeremy Irons in his slightly detached manner, is a teacher in Switzerland. When he saves the life of a woman, she disappears leaving behind a small book written by a man named Amadeu do Prado, and a train ticket to Lisbon. Raimund becomes intrigued by the insightful writings of Amadeu, who has since died. Admittedly, all this setting up of the story is pretty contrived, but the important thing in the plot was to get Raimund on that journey to discover more about Amadeu.He meets many people who knew Amadeu including his sister played by Charlotte Rampling, always an intriguing screen presence, she still seems to get plenty of roles with absolutely no loss of mystique. As Raimund delves deeper and deeper into the story of Amadeu, and his relationship with revolutionaries during the Salazar regime in Portugal, he becomes aware that much is missing from his own life.Amadeu's story is told through extensive flashbacks, with younger actors playing the parts of the older storytellers - maybe it's this element that some thought outmoded. Flashback was a technique beloved of film noir where we even had flashbacks within flashbacks. The structure of ""Night Train to Lisbon"" is not unlike 1944's ""The Mask of Dimitrios"". Although the plots are different, that old film was also about someone who becomes intrigued by the life of another man, mainly through the memories of others. I'm sure there are plenty of other examples.It wasn't until near the end that I realised ""Night Train to Lisbon"" had similarities not so much to old movies, but to a much older story: Raimund is inspired by the wisdom and profound sayings of a man who seemed better than other men, who spoke out against evil, became a healer and saves the life of a man whom he had every right to think of as an enemy. Finally, Raimund's journey has become more of a pilgrimage, and through the inspiration of Amadeu, he develops a more positive outlook on life.Although not exactly blinded on the road to Damascus, Raimund does seem to have an epiphany on the train to Lisbon. I don't know if the author of the novel, Pascal Mercier, intended such a religious parallel, but the script would have been too heavy-handed for any of the characters to have made that connection; it has power if the audience finds it for themselves.If a movie doesn't grab me, I can forget nearly everything about it by the next day, however I must admit this one has stayed with me. It's a film that gets you thinking.",negative
Night Train to Lisbon,"Jeremy Irons has such a beautiful appearance and manner that it is difficult to imagine him as a boring high school teacher, but if you can make this leap then the rest follows.A mysterious sequence of events results in his finding himself on the train platform at Bern, looking for a young woman who will possibly be catching the night train to Lisbon. He fails to find her but impulsively boards the train himself, hoping to find, not this young woman but the author of a deeply poetic and philosophical book which she had in her possession.He arrives in Lisbon and begins to search for this author. He discovers that the author died at the time of the revolution which freed Portugal from Salazar's dictatorship. But he continues looking, for the people who knew him, the people who were close to him, the people who might be able to bring to life the man who wrote these penetrating observations about life and fortune and morality and fulfillment.Lisbon is beautiful. It is beautifully filmed, the streets, the houses, the interiors. The people our man meets are some of them closed and guarded, for they have been deeply wounded by their struggles in these turbulent times. But, because our man is obviously deeply concerned, their hearts are moved by the openness of his heart, and they seize the opportunity to tell the difficult truth to this truth-seeker and truth- respecter. They are people who have faced terrible dangers and taken risks that our man has only ever read about.There is a scene where the young author, still not much more than a schoolboy, reflects on the horror of everlasting life and the need for death to give meaning to any and every action.And the flashbacks show the passions, loves and jealousies of the little band of revolutionaries. But the direction is such that artistic truth is not for a moment lost; not for a moment is there either banality or melodrama.The mysterious young woman from Switzerland, who has started this whole chain of events, and whom we have forgotten about, eventually re- appears. And what a story she tells. I wept. I weep now when I remember it.",positive
Escobar: Paradise Lost,"Turning the live of Pablo Escobar – for most, the most ruthless drug-lord in history, for others, mainly his countrymen, a form of Robin Hood – into a motion picture, would conjure up images of a Columbian ""Scarface"". Unfortunately the director, obviously rather new to his trade, has chosen an entire different direction. The first half is more or less a variation of ""Last King of Scotland"". As in: naïve, western simpleton (Josh Hutcherson) becomes the boyfriend of Maria (Claudia Traisac), a niece of Pablo Escobar, and soon part of the family of one of the most dangerous drug-traffickers on the South-American continent (Benicio del Toro), and eventually has the ball turned on him. Realizing that he is merely an expendable pawn for the ruthless Escobar, the second part is a thrilling, albeit predictable chase-scene between the Hutcherson-character and Escobar's henchmen.Del Toro as villain is as competent as you'd expect from the actor, but unfortunately, the script doesn't give him much to work with. We learn preciously little about the figure Escobar. Was he simply a self-serving thug, who hid from the limelight under the disguise of a philanthropist? Or were there deeper shades of grey to the character? We'll never find out (at least not through this movie). Primarily, the film focuses on Hutcherson, whose character (or acting abilities) isn't all that interesting. Again, apart from the basic premise, the film has something else in common with above mentioned ""Last King of Scotland"": Hutcherson is likewise a fictional character (unlike McAvoy's doctor, that was essentially an amalgamation of various real people). Though some people, like myself, aren't always comfortable with mixing fact and fiction under the mantle of artistic freedom, it at least would have been an opportunity to take a close look at the fascinating figure of Escobar through an outside eye. But once the story is turned into a pure run-and-chase-film and Hutcherson takes centre-stage, making you forget about the titular character, that opportunity is completely wasted.Rumours have it that there is another Escobar-film planned, featuring Javier Bardem in the title-role will bring. Which reminds us: one of the more memorable supporting actors, playing the role of ruthless killer, is played by Bardems older brother Carlos. Once again proves that acting-skills sometimes runs in the family. The rest of the cast simply left me wondering why I should care very much about them in the first place. Same goes for the chemistry between Hutcherson and Traisac; though no doubt a beautiful actress, there is very little depth to their relationship, which makes it seem forced, merely there to drive the basic storyline.In the end, it just seems that director Andrea Di Stefano, though technically having done an alright job, bit off more than he could chew for his debut and it doesn't surprise that ""Escobar"" – at least at this point in time – has remained his only film. So, to see a grand epos on the life and times of Pablo Escobar, we'll probably have to wait a little longer (whereby I have not yet seen the TV-Series and cannot judge on that). I'm probably not the only viewer who sees the whole deal as a huge waste of opportunity, especially in light of having such a fine actor as Benicio del Toro in what could have been the role of a lifetime. A mediocre 5/10, sad to say.",negative
Escobar: Paradise Lost,"Entertaining! Paradise Lost tells the story of a foreigner who goes to Colombia with his brother to open a surfing school and ends up falling in love with the niece of the infamous Pablo Escobar, the drug warlord. As you can imagine, his life spirals into chaos as soon as he starts getting serious with that girl. While he seems to be in good terms with the mafia clan at the beginning, as soon as Escobar's life gets complicated and justice tries to trap him, the lives of those around him follow the same disastrous path.The tension of the movie comes from never knowing if the protagonist's love for his girl is going to be strong enough to put up with living with one of the most dangerous guys on earth at the time, or whether he is going to escape from the obviously choosing the wrong path. It's hard to tell if the movie is based on true events, (google can clarify that I'm sure) but either way, the film might easily have some resemblance with reality, since it is well known by everyone who Escobar was and how ruthless a man he came to be. I would honestly not hesitate to watch it as a good Sunday afternoon movie. But bear in mind, it's also the type of film that you will easily forget.",positive
Maggie's Plan,"New Yorker Maggie Hardin (Greta Gerwig) wants to have a baby. Her relationships never last more than six months except her college romance with best friend Tony (Bill Hader) but that doesn't count. She decides to get sperm from college acquaintance, pickle entrepreneur Guy Childers. She works at an art school with Tony's wife Felicia (Maya Rudolph) and John Harding (Ethan Hawke). Maggie and John meet over a paycheck mixup and start a relationship over a novel he's trying to write. He's unhappily married to Columbia professor Georgette (Julianne Moore) with two kids.The appeal of this movie depends a lot on one's appreciation of Gerwig's flighty, quirky persona. It's a rom-com where the romance is not the most likable. Harding starts off poorly and I never find him a good match for Maggie. Even the pickle guy is better although Tony could be the best if there is no Felicia. I'm actually glad at the turn in the second half of the movie and it becomes an anti-rom-com. The funniest relationship is between Maggie and Georgette. The movie could do with more of them together.",negative
Maggie's Plan,"Greta Gerwig as ""Maggie"" (an independent woman) bakes up a plan to become a single mother and in the process 'the plan' works but then backfires and puts her into a situation 'the plan' did not include - marriage.Gerwig gives a charming performance as Maggie steering a course through a relationship with a overly analytical writer once divorced husband, raising her three year old child, working her job as an instructor in a local college, and realizing her husband is still in love with his first wife! Maggie is in a pickle so she devises another plan!The setting is the New York City intellectual society living in row houses and meeting in cafe's to socialize. The cast includes Bill Hader, Ethan Hawke, Maya Rudolph, Julianne Moore, Wallace Shawn. This is a simple 'slice of life' type story about modern people looking for and finding happiness and direction in their life. It's probably a film more appreciated by a viewer that likes a romantic flavor in a story that looks into the feelings and emotion in the human spirit.This is a cheerful light story that includes just a touch of sorrow mixed into a picture of mostly happy people getting on with life. And don't forget the pickles!",positive
45 Years,"With nary a critical word to be found amongst the fawners in the film critics' pantheon, 45 Years has gone on to receive a surfeit of undeserved approbation in such places as Metacritic, with an unbelievable ""metascore"" of 94. My first reaction to this onslaught of film critic stupidity was simply to ask, ""How can this be?""45 Years may be infected with a simple case of being ""too British."" Now don't get me wrong—I love quite a number of British films, which often prove superior to their American counterparts. But when a film ends up being ""too British,"" it often suffers from glacial pacing and a rather dry demeanor which 45 Years obviously suffers from throughout.But there are plenty of films featuring lugubrious plots with humorless characters that still remain compelling. What's needed of course is a plot that goes somewhere, and characters that manage to avoid being pejoratively labeled as ""sad sacks."" Unfortunately, 45 Years avoids none of this and more!It's all supposed to be about some kind of marital crisis that befalls an aging, childless couple by the name of Kate and Geoff Mercer who live in the flatlands of Norfolk, in eastern England. Kate and Geoff's idyllic existence is suddenly shattered when Geoff receives a letter that his ex-girlfriend Katya's body, lost in an Alpine hiking accident 50 years earlier, has been suddenly found perfectly preserved inside a glacier in the Swiss Alps.Andrew Haigh, the writer-director here, apparently was quite enamored with this gimmick of an inciting incident which he conscripted from a short story entitled Another Country. Haigh's idea is to show how Kate's perspective on the marriage changes after new information comes to light regarding Geoff's relationship with the ex-girlfriend.Geoff remains what he's been all along: a curmudgeon. He can't understand why Kate should be upset over a relationship he was involved in years ago. The revelation that Katya took his surname bothers Kate but not Geoff, who merely takes to smoking cigarettes to assuage the anxiety he's experiencing over Kate's growing dissatisfaction with him. Oh yes, he's a bit of a lefty too as it's revealed that he once called Kate's friend a ""fascist,"" during a political discussion that got out of hand. As for Kate, one wonders why she should be upset over something that happened fifty years earlier. It's mainly the principle of Geoff not being honest with her. But she appears to throw her principles out the window when she surreptitiously and underhandedly goes up to the attic and views some old slides of Katya, taken by Geoff right before the accident. There, (simmering with jealousy), she spies a close-up picture of Katya, visibly pregnant.While all this is going on, the couple is getting ready for their 45th wedding anniversary. Kate simply has to put on a good face while the couple is finally heralded by all their friends at the actual banquet. Kate's ""new perspective"" on her marriage is the ""big"" revelation that we're supposed to get excited about. The critics use big words to describe what is really a simple change in circumstances: ""devastating truth,"" a ""sensitive and devastating portrait of a long, happy marriage in sudden crisis,"" ""quietly moving and deceptively tragic,"" a story ""about whether secrets can be survived,"" ""two people haunted by a specter from another lifetime,"" ""deep reserves of inner torment."" You get the picture!Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay can do little with the material foisted upon them and the viewer only perks up when one or another nostalgic tune from the 60s pops up intermittently on the film's soundtrack.In the end, the critics would like you to believe that 45 Years represents the second coming of Ingmar Bergman. Nothing could be further than the truth. If your protagonists are deadly dull to begin with, and your inciting incident leads to the feeblest of epiphanies, then please explain to me what the critics' brouhaha is all about.",negative

An unexpected letter with some unsettling news that pulls, just a little, at the seams of the marriage.Scenic English country side outside a historic market town. Accomplished performances by all of the cast. Charming British accents. Lovely camera work. Tight scripting & dialogs that brings out the affections and tensions of a long, childless marriage. All of this points to an engaging movie, and it is.Except, there isn't enough in it. It's like someone took the plot of a short story and decided to spin it out into a novel and you wish they hadn't. It's like a samosa where they skimped on the aloo. It is worth a watch, just about, especially on a day where you feel your life has been too dramatic and you want to tamp it down a little.",positive
X+Y,"The movie came across as a 6.5 to me and a part of it might be the high expectations I had of it after seeing a 97% fresh rating and a lot of positive criticism. Expectations aside, having viewed movies on music prodigy, math prodigies and ones based on biographies,this came across as a rather mundane effort with little screen time spent on the beauty of Maths.The characterization had be tad befuddled too. The specific aspects being the kid suffering from Asperger's which seems to be specifically directed at the mom. My medical knowledge of the condition is limited, however, it's understandable if they showed how the mom couldn't handle his condition but here that was not the case. He merged well enough with the team and took off rather well with the girl. Then why was he being a complete ass to his mother? That being said, the acting and the pace of direction was good enough but left me wanting something better out of it.",negative
X+Y,"Let me start off with a disclaimer: I am an aspie. A mild aspie, but an aspie nonetheless. I can get very upset at times, at other times I can become very nervous, and am anxious a lot of the time. I write and I act for many reasons, but one of the biggest is that through those films I can express the things I otherwise can't bring myself to. I suppose that's why I'm writing this. The average perception of those on the spectrum is as follows: Weird, odd, sad, different. We're seen as someone to pity or someone who's an easy target for a joke. The media doesn't do us many favours either, with films tending to all stick to common stereotypes without every really looking underneath. At least, that's how it feels. X+Y is a film that looks underneath, and I love it for that. (And yes, I'm aware it took nine lines until I actually started talking about the film, and for that I apologise. I'll try to make up for it) I will admit, this film was sometimes hard to watch for me, and that some scenes hit very close to home. This film doesn't shy away from the truth, nor does it allow itself to be clouded by sentimentality. This film was directed by a documentary filmmaker, and you can tell; the film is involved, up close, personal, and always strives to convey the truth. Basically, this film gets it. I don't think I've felt as strong an emotional connection to a film in a very long time. The characters were beautifully written and performed by the stellar cast, but I feel a special mention has to be given to three of the actors in particular: Asa Butterfield, who portrays Nathan with such grace and skill, and captures the mannerisms and inner struggles of those on the spectrum brilliantly. The character is well written, yes, but I honestly can't imagine any other actor in the role. It is without a doubt the best performance of his career, and if he doesn't win SOMETHING for his role, I will be incredibly disappointed. He turns the character into a real person, a real person who just thinks and acts a little differently to everyone else. A real person who deserves to be treated as anyone else would, and not looked down upon. Words cannot describe how good he is in this film (and I could say the same about the two others to come). Justwow. A great performance. Sally Hawkins, who portrays Nathan's mother Julie with such warmth, such heart and such believability. Not only does the film focus on Nathan alone, it also focuses on those he cares about, Julie in particular. She's someone who has sacrificed so much, and has had to care for her son on her own. She understands why Nathan doesn't want to hold her hand or talk to her, but understanding doesn't make it any easier for her to deal with, and still feels that she doesn't understand Nathan at all. Sally Hawkins, bravo. Finally, Jake Davies, who plays the character Luke. And honestly, I'm at a loss for words. I cried at most of the moments he was on screen: I cried out of recognition of both my younger self and of those I have met further up the spectrum than myself. I once knew someone just like Luke, and one scene in particular which involves a re-enactment of a famous comedy sketch almost felt like it came from real life. I was never really like Luke, but I've met plenty of people who are, and to see people like him represented in a film is brilliant. People like Luke Shelton exist in every school, and are all treated the same: bullied, and made fun of or belittled. It's not their fault that they insult people; they don't do it deliberately, they just don't understand how people can be offended. They don't read faces or hear speech patterns like the average person does, but that doesn't mean that people like Luke don't feel emotion themselves. They do, they really do. And Jake Davies conveys that brilliantly, and even manages to make us laugh a few times. (I noticed I said ""I'm at a loss for words"" and yet managed to talk about his performance the most. Go figure.) I forgot I was looking at actors; I just saw real people. (As a side note, I adored every performance in the film, it's just that those three touched me the most).To the makers of this film: thank you. Justthank you. You have made an aspie who sometimes feels like nobody understands realise that people do understand. This film is just glorious, fantastic and truthful. People, spread the word! All must watch this! Make sure that X+Y doesn't get overshadowed, and make sure you go in knowing as little as possible. Don't watch the trailer like I did, because it gives away far too much.My favourite film of 2014, and one of my favourites of all time. A masterpiece, plain and simple.EDIT: Wow. Looked back on this review after a few months and was stunned by the amount of attention it got. Also was sorry to hear that a few people didn't like the film. Ah well. If this review managed to get a few more people to see the film, then that's grand. A few users have said some reviews misled them, and if mine was one of them, well then I'm sorry you were disappointed. Really, I am. It's a shame you didn't like it as much as I did, and it was never my intention to mislead. Basically, the above review still reflects how I felt when I first watched the film.

About Last Night,"This movie re-make was extremely disappointing. I'd been waiting to see this DVD for the last three months and I was really looking forward to it. I saw the '80s version with Demi Moore and Rob Lowe and I really enjoyed it. It is not a classic or even a cult film by any means, but it was entertaining and the acting was believable.This remake was horrible - the acting was flat with the exception of Regina Hall and even so, she was a little over the top as Joan. Kevin Hart was screechy (like Chris Tucker) and seemed to be doing a comedy stand-up routine throughout the movie rather than really getting into his character. Joy Bryant seemed to have phoned in her part and was by far the dullest character in the movie. The dog, Pacino, was more exciting than this Debbie. I've been a fan of Michael Ealy's for years, and I was taken by surprise that he didn't do more with his role. His relationship with Debbie was one-dimensional and there didn't seem to be any chemistry between Danny and Debbie at all. I didn't really care whether or not they got back together because it never seemed as if they had a relationship to begin with.",negative
About Last Night,"I attended a screening of the film a week prior to it opening in theaters. Will Packer, Kevin Hart and Regina Hall came to the theater to get viewers reactions that evening. ""About Last Night"" is the funniest, most realistic romantic comedy I've seen. However, be mindful of having a mouth full of beverage or food because Kevin Hart is hilarious in this movie and Regina Hall compliments him very well with her comedic acting. Both actors coming off of the heels of other recent successful movies (""Best Man Holiday"" for Hall and ""Ride Along"" for Hart) may make you assume that they gave their best performances already. But in my opinion, this was some of the best work I've seen from both actors. Michael Ealy is incredibly good to look at and a good actor as well, with a current TV show receiving good reviews and it's nice to see Joy Bryant on the big screen once again. Whether you're a couple or a single person, you will relate to these characters personally or know of someone in your life they remind you of. It doesn't matter what race you are either. Relationships and the emotions and issues that come with them are universal. I encourage you to see this movie and not just for Valentine's Day, but on any day.",positive
Ashby,"This might have been a mediocre movie. I knew someone who was a military sniper. His guilt over what he had done overcame him, and he committed suicide. There isis a meaningful story here that could have meant something.But how stupid can a producer, writer, or director be to put an MRI in the basement of a family home? It boggles the mind how stupid that is. A magnetic resonance imaging machine (MRI) will attract any metal to it while it is operating. That includes wrenches, bicycles, zippers on jeans, metal snaps on varsity jackets, etc.I have a friend who has metal fragments in his neck. He can't have an MRI because the machine would literally put the fragments out of his neck and possibly kill him. That's how powerful an MRI is. This whole MRI thing is just stupid, stupid, stupid.",negative
Ashby,"For those out there who seek out to destroy every piece of art. This is a movie about friendship, respect and love. This is a story about facing yourself in the mirror. A movie which will leave you thinking. Watch it, and enjoy it. The older Mikey gets the better his performances become. Although the depth of the characters is left shallow, the storyline is well done. If you are going to watch a movie anyway, then watch this one. Because this movie will teach you a thing or two; about life and everything that comes with it.We liked it personally because of the message is tries to convey while courage, love, friendship and family are at the front of this epic movie.",positive
Tallulah,"...Just like a lot of movies I've seen lately...that ending...wtf?! I can't stand movies with absolutely no closure for an ending (with the exception of a few psychological thriller, mystery/suspense, and horror movies). It's like everyone gets tired of making the movie so they just end it suddenly. All this time spent on character development...trying to make you like them or empathize with their situation, and yet you're not supposed to care about what happens to them or the outcome of the story? It's absurdity. Why the ratings are so high for this film is beyond me. Not the worst, but there are much better films out there. Watch I Heart Huckabees instead.",negative
Tallulah,"My wife and I both found this a small masterpiece.The writing is enchanting.The players are superb. Ellen Page never ceases to amaze. She is one very talented lady.Allison Jenney's work is always worth watching, never more so than in this flick.I found the Carolyn part played just a wee bit over the top.At a time when far too many movies are made for a young audience devoid of aesthetic sensibility, it's movies like this that rekindle love of film in the mature movie-goer.",positive
Mon roi,"The movie itself is not good. Get tired too fast. You see quickly what the problem is going to be. It will be because we have seen it many times, but seeing characters so extreme you know that from one end goes to the next and not surprising.The actors are very well, that can not be denied. They are all very well.There are times when you even laugh at the graces Cassel makes. Even knowing that such a character will go to the other end. The problem is that the first thing you think about is because Bercot does not realize it.What has taken me most out of the film is the montage it has. It is becoming fashionable non-linear assembly, but for me in this case, does not let you get to empathize with the characters in the good times and also let you suffer with them in the bad, because throughout the film You have been seeing the end and the beginning. Apart from being too long the friendly part.It has a very French photograph, white bone, it does not count anything. Let the script alone be the most important. It seems that they do not know that the cinema is composed of several stages.The management, manages to create a close couple, yes, but only that. He gets bored at times and does not see that it is long. He also does not know how to narrate with the camera.I do not understand that you want the last sequence or that I'm too rational",negative
Mon roi,"Tony (Emmanuelle Bercot) tries desperately to recall the tempestuous relationship she had with Giorgio (Vincent Cassel). Why did they fall in love? Were they both in love or was it just her ? Who was Giorgio for real ? Was he himself at every moment or was he manipulating her ? How could she be so blind and how could she let this passion submit herself that much and that far into a circle of destruction ? The controversial French director, Maïwenn, ex wife of Luc Besson has now proved (if she ever had to) she has reached maturity and mastery in every aspect of directing a movie from filming and directing actors to writing dialogs and a subtle scenario. The performances of the actors are just astonishing. Vincent Cassel seems he is like himself, smooth talker and bold, Emmanuelle Bercot gives it all showing restraint with huge pain,just like her character who cannot believe she has to go through that much but who needs to cope with every single situation. Anchored in reality, the cinema of Maiwen confirms it is based on genuine dialogs and a rough reality.What is new and different from her other movies, it's that this time she tackles a very common theme: Love, passion, maybe with something less personal, but still with her rough way always at the limit of physical violence. Fortunately, there are light-full moments that make this drama pleasant to watch. I was really surprised because I was not sure I liked the cinema of Maiwenn. I would even dare to say that this movie is not far from perfect (except the first scene with the psychologist that sounds so fake ! What a pity!). The strength of the film lies in its ability to hold the attention all the way through. It's indeed a breathless and thrilling experience to watch this film, because you expect the situation to worsen even more, you expect the character to realize what she is going though, you expect the director to make this passion a nightmare but she does not. The film features an astonishing performance from the two actors (the actress received the prize for her performance in Cannes). It features as well intense moments of emotion interrupted from time to time with light-full and hilarious moments, especially thanks to the character of the brother. I would spot this as something new in Maiwenn's cinema, because she was not used to allowing us to take our breath... Very well done Maïwenn this time, can't wait to see the next one !",positive
L'inconnu du lac,"First let me clarify. This movie has a lot of simulated homosexual sex but only a couple of brief scenes could be consider real and are not that strong.I am male and not gay so for me was easier to see BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR (L' Vie the Adele) than confronting with a movie about male cruising but after the unanimous word of mouth about this movie I took the risk and I am happy I did.The movie is pretty simple. One big lake, a wood and a parking lot. The pace is deliberately slow but pretty involving. In certain moments the suspense reach Hitchcock levels.The story is quite simple too. Just the necessary twists to create a particular situation. In a ""cruising environment"" near a lake Franck see his object of desire possibly commit ting a crime and basically lies to the police in order to cover it.What really matters are the very few characters in that environment and their interactions.In the same way BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR was better told from a woman perspective; this tale is perfectly suited for men. Both are great movies; put aside prejudices and see both.",negative
L'inconnu du lac,"This movie made me very nervous - a lot of male sex and nudity out in the open, on the beach, and with no protection. No sunscreen. At all. Shocking! (haven't the French ever heard of skin cancer?)While it sometimes verges into Serious Movie territory, breaking sexual taboos in a very realistic and honest way, too much of the film is just silly and arbitrary. The randomness of actions among the characters seemed guided more by the writer's keyboard than by actual human behavior. Which is a shame because so many of the film's elements: acting, direction, music, editing et al. are is so first-rate, and many of the scenes on their own feel so emotionally authentic.But in a world where anything can happen for no apparent reason, nothing carries any import. And then one's mind is free to contemplate the clumsiness of the film's obvious symbolism and how uncomfortable it must have been for the actors to have to sit on that rocky lakeshore bare-assed.And eventually, it all just spirals out of control. Which made me feel sad, but for all the wrong reasons.",positive
Life After Beth,"LIFE AFTER BETH (2014) * Aubrey Plaza, Dane DeHaan, John C.

The crimes against comedy (let alone humanity) is first-time (and hopefully LAST time) filmmaker Jeff Baena who wouldn't recognize a fart from an ad-lib in his tone-deaf attempt at satire, dark comedy or sharp skewer to cul-de-sac audiences he's so desperately catering to while completely wasting his vast amount of talent acquired (squandering so much comedic casting is unbearably sad). And trust me you would never want to see comedy guru Marshall as a member of the undead in spotty make-up and doddering dialogue! (Un)dead on arrival.",negative
Life After Beth,"This is a horror comedy. Except, it's not. People who expect the usual mix of jump scares and laughs from this movie end up most disappointed. It's a love story with zombies. But not a happy one like Warm Bodies. Much more sad and dramatic. And humor is much more dry and subtle. Unfortunately, people who sit down to watch a zombie comedy do not really expect subtle. And people who want subtle do not look into zombie comedies. This is why this little gem is one of the most underrated movies on IMDB. Watch it without expectations and you might enjoy it much more.",positive

Jenny's Wedding,"Jenny's Wedding, for the most part, has been discarded and labelled below average amongst most film critics and the public, therefore I began watching this film with preconceived ideas. Films consisting of gay female relationships are sparse, and ones that are watchable are even rarer, however this happened to fall into both categories. The problem arises when viewers deem the focus of this film to be something different to what it is, many people comment on the lack of chemistry between Heigl and Bledel, whereas upon watching the film it is clear the lack of screen time they actually had together played a part in that, and the film is less about their relationship as such, and much more focused on Heigl's family and their relationships with each other and Jenny respectively. Needless to say it was a sweet, feel-good film that; of course, has a plot which has been done many times before, but still kept me watching until the end.",negative
Jenny's Wedding,"Jenny's Wedding is an under-appreciated film that I think will surprise many of you. It is one of many fine quality films that I find myself asking: Why didn't this get more than just an extremely shallow limited release? It certainly deserved better than only grossing a paltry $6244 worldwide, especially considering the end product.Piloted by veteran screenwriter-director Mary Agnes Donaghue (Beaches, White Oleander), the movie starts with a well written script. It is bolstered by fine performances across the board from a talented cast that includes Katherine Heigl, Tom Wilkinson, Linda Edmund, Grace Gummer and Alexis Beidel. It's crew achieved high production values that would compare favorably with films 5 times their budget. It has all the ingredients to be a fine film and delivers on that promise.Jenny's Wedding problem lies in Hollywood's inability to label it and know how to sell it rather than the film itself. It never meets the expectations unfairly placed on it by others to be a film it never pretended to be. It never was intended to be a laugh a minute comedy or a sappy love story or even a bold message film. It is an honest portrayal of how family members when placed in unfamiliar waters, may surprise or disappoint, themselves and others in how they act.I think this film benefits greatly from being seen with out any expectations. I had the benefit of watching this film without seeing the trailer or reading the blurb, both which reveal too much about the story. I enjoyed how the story unfolded, the slightly surprising but not shocking plot twist, and the unpredictability of how family members act and react when conflict arises. It had a credible balance of painful and feel good moments that any normal family goes through. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Jenny's Wedding and hope you will too.",positive
Miss You Already,"The low ratings are surprising. This was beautiful film in every way. It's sad but also warm and even funny at times. If you are in the mood for a soul nourishing tear jerker, this film will deliver.",negative
Miss You Already,"This is the archetypal woman's film - but there's nothing wrong with that, with far too few opportunities for women in the key roles in movie-making. So women fill the slots of scriptwriter (the British Morwenna Banks), director (American Catherine Hardwicke) and the two top acting positions (Australian Toni Collette and American Drew Barrymore). And the subject material is feminine too: breast cancer, infertility, and female friendship. Like ""The Fault In Our Stars"", this is a frank exposition of what it is like to suffer cancer - in this case, with chemotherapy and its attendant sickness, tiredness and hair loss followed by headaches, vision loss, and pain. It sounds tough and it is - one the saddest film I've seen in a long while - but there is humour and warmth and superior acting which make it worth viewing this real slice of life. After all, most of us of a certain age have had relatives or friends who have suffered one form of cancer or another, some surviving, some not.",positive
Top Five,"Those that have reviewed this movie must be involved in receiving monies from it. I'm a regular movie goer and this had to be one of the worst I've seen in a long time. Very embarrassing for Chris Rock.Rosario Dawson did her best to make this movie watchable and even believable but this was sad. Chris Rock has never been a good actor...so imagine combining bad acting with a terrible movie. Do such and you get Top Five.There are many big names that make an appearance or two in this movie, yet it doesn't help. Cedric the Entertainer plays more of a role than most and has some funny parts. He is like a promoter, pimp, etc that will provide a few laughs but the movie is just awful.This also taught me to not trust the reviews on here. Wow!!!",negative
Top Five,"'TOP FIVE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Chris Rock wrote, directed and stars in this comedy flick about a former stand-up comedian, and popular movie star, who tries to make it in serious film; while also marrying a reality TV star, on TV. It costars Rosario Dawson, Gabrielle Union, Kevin Hart, J.B. Smoove and many others. It also features cameos from celebrities like Tracy Morgan, Cedric the Entertainer, DMX, Whoopi Goldberg, Adam Sandler and Jerry Seinfeld. The film has gotten almost unanimously positive reviews from critics and has been nominated for multiple awards as well (and it's also won a couple). I think it's a well made and funny movie and it deserves all the praise and recognition it's been getting (too bad that doesn't result in big Box Office).Rock plays a celebrity, somewhat similar to himself, named Andre Allen. Allen was an extremely successful stand-up comedian, who also starred in a blockbuster film franchise called 'Hammy The Bear'. He also had some alcohol problems and legal issues though, in his past, and is now a recovering alcoholic. Allen is now engaged to a popular reality TV star, named Erica Long (Union), that he's supposed to marry on TV. His first serious film, called 'Uprise' (a movie about the violent Haitian revolution), is also being released that weekend. Fans just want to see him do more comedy and 'Hammy The Bear' films though. Allen's also agreed to do a detailed interview, with a reporter named Chelsea Brown (Dawson), that same weekend too.The movie is funny but what I'm most impressed with, about the film, is Rock's skills as a director and film writer. I already knew he was funny, and could write and deliver a lot of good jokes, but I didn't know he was this talented of a filmmaker. Although some of the humor is pretty silly, it still feels like you're watching real people in real situations. Rock's commentary on the film business, stand-up comedy and reality TV seems pretty spot-on too. He's good in the lead and the supporting cast is almost equally as impressive; Dawson is always beautiful and likable to watch and Union is stunning and gorgeous too. The cameos are also to die for. It's just a really good film!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/O9KTvaLDibs",positive
Julieta,"What happened to Almodovar. He used to be controversial, with great humor, provoking thoughts and sending the audience on a roller-coaster ride. And now this, a subtle indication of a daughter with mother issues and underlined homosexual tones, but no surprises really in store, a subtle story, but the subtlety never becomes anything but subtle and with no major impact - a half-hearted effort.This was a far cry from his master pieces like Talk to her, Volver and The skin I live in. Almost a waste of time, except for the nice landscapes and decent cinematography, I cannot believe he actually won best director for that movie, a shadow of his former self!",negative
Julieta,"This Palme d'Or contestant does not reflect Almodovar's penchant for gender-bending, or his often convoluted scripts. However, it retains his female-centric theme. As ""Julieta"" is very much event-driven, I shall take the liberty of giving it chapter titles. The prologue shows Julieta on the verge of cleansing any thought of her daughter Antia who has gone missing for over a decade. Then she bumps into Antia's teenage-days buddy Beatrice who has in turn recently bumped into Antia, now a mother of three. This triggers Julieta's writing letters to her missing daughter (with nowhere to send) to tell her things she had not been told before. The main body of the movie is flashbacks based on these letters.1. STRANGERS ON THE TRAIN. Julieta is seventeen. The first stranger is a middle-age man who tries to strike up a conversation, which turns her away. The second is young fisherman Xoan she encounters in the dining car, reminding you of Celine and Jessie. But circumstances are different as Xoan has a wife who is in a coma. There is distinct Hitchcockian mood here when the train comes to an abrupt halt. Despite the engineer's categorical denial, the train did hit something. When it turns out that it is the successful suicide attempt of the middle-age man, Julieta suffers a sudden pang of guilt while Xoan comforts her. They end up making love on the train.2. DOMESTICITY BLISS. A few months later, a letter from Xoan announcing his wife's demise brings Julieta to his village, when she has news for him too: she is pregnant. Antia is born healthy and beautiful.3. MOTHER'S HELPER. In a side-plot, Julieta brings Antia on a short trip to visit her parents (father just retired and mother an invalid). Turns out that the old couple has hired a young and attractive live-in helper who, in addition to taking care of her mother, also takes care of her father, in a different way. But since Julieta has her own life, in a different city, there isn't much she can do.4. UNDERCURRENTS. There are two characters with significance surrounding Xoan. Marian is the dominating matron-type part-time helper who for obvious reasons display immediate hostility towards Julieta. On the other hand, Ava, a sculpture artist, Xoan's long-time friend, is genuinely friendly. When Julieta eventually fires Marian, the latter intimates, through innuendos, that Ava is Xoan's ex-lover and the two still have rendezvous occasionally.5. TRAGEDY HITS. During a 3-week period when teenage Antia is at camp, Julieta confronts Xoan about Ava, which may or may not be the reason he seeks refuge on a fishing trip, gets caught in a sudden storm and drowns. In the meantime, Antia at camp meets Beatrice (who appeared in the prologue) and the pair becomes instantly inseparable. This ended up with Antia going to spend some time at Beatrice's affluent house immediately after camp, necessitating Julieta's going there to announce the tragic news of her father's untimely death.6. WIDOWED. Mother and daughter move to an apartment and continue their life without a man-in-the-house as Julieta accepts another undesirable reality that she has to share her daughter's affection with Beatrice. After high school, however, Beatrice seeks her career in New York while Antia goes to a secluded retreat for three months as in interlude before university.7. DISAPPEARANCE. Julieta drives all the way to pick up Antia, only to be told that her daughter does not want to see her and has gone on to seek her own fulfillment. She lives through hell for a few years, hearing only once from Antia, a blank birthday card on the latter's own birthday.8. TYING UP LOOSE ENDS. Upon visiting Ava (Multiple Sclerosis) Julieta finds more clue about Antia's leaving, but nothing conclusive. More importantly, she meets Ava's friend Lorenzo, and the two ended up ""giving a reason for each other's existence"". This brings the timeline backs to the opening prologue when Julieta bumps into Beatrice. That happens again some time later, with more revelation from Beatrice. The conclusion comes as a letter from Antia with nothing that can really be called a twist.I may have used up all the allowed space and this turns out to be sort of a synopsis. So very quickly: great acting, good story-telling, engaging scenes – a somewhat different Almodovar, but still quite recognizable.",positive
The Last: Naruto the Movie,"horrible movie. road to ninja was popular because it gave time to all characters, and we got a sense of team 7 again (somewhat). the manga was originally about team 7, this movie just took that away. i like naruto and hinata together, really but they should have given the other couples some screen time too instead of leaving them hanging. i mean, even ten minutes each ? sasuke and sakura at least deserved some screen time, they're the main characters aside naruto, and the fans die to see team 7 moments again in combat since we haven't had those animated since narutos first season. ALSO they really should have given us some team 7 moments since this was the last movie we would get to see those. everyone loved the last moments of team 7 in the manga, that's what people like.

Tamasha,"I was damn excited for a movie with the deadly combo of Imtiaz Ali and Ranbir Kapoor including AR Rahman (cherry on top). I loved Rockstar, it was among one of my favorites in 2011.

There was a constant smile stuck on my face throughout its 139 min of runtime. Ranbir Kapoor's performance literally gave me awe-bumps (you know like goosebumps). Dayum, he's an excellent actor cum artist. Deepika was magnificent. And the songs, man. Each and everyone of it is bound to snug around your ears throughout the year.Now let me get this straight, those who criticize this masterpiece are the same audience who disliked Rockstar, not because it was bad or something, it's just that they don't get it. They do not understand these kinda films. It's a piece of art. And I don't blame my fellow Indian audience to not to get along with these musical dramas, 'cuz they're way more inclined to commercial movies and the basic recipe of Bollywood masala crap. It's their comfort zone, and these movies make them uncomfortable.Well, I'm shocked seeing negative remarks or even mixed reviews on such an extravagant cinema.

Grace of Monaco,"I hope Hollywood would stop using famous and well-known actors to embody famous actors whose lives they pay homage to. As a viewer, my perception becomes too skewed with trying to remember who the homage is for and how well the actor is performing. I would love to imagine the honored person's life being played out in the big screen, if Hollywood doesn't mind. In my opinion, a less known or unknown look-alike would do that. Nicole Kidman is a beautiful actor but I couldn't imagine nor remember Princess Grace. Also, Nicole Kidman does NOT have Grace Kelly's facial bone structure nor the look in her eyes that made Grace Kelly so famous and loved. Now Tim Roth who played the role of Prince Rainier was just frustrating. Disappointing.",negative
Grace of Monaco,"Hahahaha I wonder why people are so comparing this movie with the real life of princess Grace, this is a movie of course not 100% of it depicts 100% real life story of a person. However this movie is excellent to realize one time event of life yup the event where France tried to overtake Monaco but indeed Grace managed to save the whole country and became awesome magnificent princess and mother of 2 for this movie. Nicole Kidman acting wonderfully well which showed great struggle between staying in a foreign literally different culture with her liberal ""freedom to speak"" culture hometown, she obviously succeed showing her emotions and grace as the old nobility where ""divorce"" was taboo at that time. Tim Roth as prince Reiner showing great chemistry with her while not losing his excellent skill of acting. Most of the actors in this movie are great cast with wonderful scenery and setting. The director succeed bringing the best of the actors' skill and kept me watching this movie until the end without a hint of boringness. I don't really know about the history of Grace Kelly and her family that well just knew her as a beautiful actress and a princess who loved her family dearly but through this movie I really admire her more since she could survive the bad phase of her life and conflicts even though it's not the end of her problems yet she continued her role model as a wonderful princess, wive, and mother.",positive
The Lunchbox,"'The Lunchbox' is a wondrous film. I thought of five different ways I could make the opening of this review more appealing but then that would be ironical given that the film thrives on its gift of fluid simplicity. The story revolves around two characters brought together by a fortuitous mistake, that of the hallowed dabbawala delivering the wrong lunch box. An ageing widower is accidentally fed a sumptuous meal cooked by a young wife angling for her husband's affections through the proverbial gastronomic route. The dabba returns to the wife in the evening and so does the apathy of the aloof husband, oblivious of the slipup. The elements which prompt her to cook with the same vigour the following day, yet not flag the previous day's mistake with the messenger conspires further when an unsure correspondence is struck between the two - He, true to his staid economy of words and she, to her clamant need to confide. The platter changes with time as anonymity breeds confidence between two unsuspecting strangers. They gravitate towards each other, bound by the cords of empathy and their own private miseries. What is most tantalizingly beautiful is how the mirthless Fernandez rediscovers his zest for life in these letters yet cannot bring himself to tear down his prison of laconic brevity. He basks in the glory of having bought a painting of a city landscape which has him in it, or so he thinks. He plays the reformed 'selfish giant' with kids, tries to quit smoking, proclaims unabashedly of having a 'girlfriend' to a young couple and then in an moment of inspiration proposes a refuge from their miserable lives – a promise to build anew. But, just when he is about to launch into his flight of resurrection does he stumble upon the paralyzing reality of mortality and its attendant anxieties. He finds his chains too comfortingly familiar for him to wish away in return for an unknown territory and its uncertainties. Doubt gets the better of him. The story ends amidst the same mosaic of urban chaos as it started in and with it we come to a grudging acceptance of the limitations of our ordinary lives - Lives which would have been rendered joyless if not for a few sparks of brilliance lending the quiet satisfaction of having lived a full life, a good life.",negative
The Lunchbox,"In an age when instant messaging, email, and various social media have made communication easier and quicker, debutant writer-director Ritesh Batra relies on scribbled notes tucked in tiffin boxes to deliver a charming, old-fashioned love story in The Lunchbox. There's a simple line in this sumptuous film that captures its essence beautifully: ""Sometimes even the wrong train can take you to the right destination."" It's a line that might help interpret the film's open ending, but one that also nicely sums up its unique premise.I'm going with ten ratings for The Lunchbox. The greatest love stories are the ones that make you root for the protagonists to come together, despite their destinies. This film illustrates how love transforms the unlikeliest of people; it breaks down Saajan's walls and gives Ila the courage to fly. Treat yourself to The Lunchbox – it'll leave you with a craving to seek your own little happiness. Best film I've seen in a long time. Acting of Irfan 10/10 Film Rating - 10/10I believe that this time LunchBox will surely make history in Oscars .",positive

Late 20s-something female in the Big City is adrift, playing at ""comedy"" (although neither my wife nor I saw anything to laugh at), rejected (quite rightly) by her boyfriend, and has a nothing job in a bookstore that's going out of business. New guy inexplicably falls for her, they have sex, she gets pregnant, decides to have an abortion, eventually tells him, he says nothing but supports her by going with her to the clinic, and then they start to watch Gone With the Wind (although where are the bells in the opening soundtrack of GWTW?). Sadly, the Jenny Slate character doesn't seem to have any redeeming qualities. Self-pity is not a redeeming quality. There is no indication whatsoever as to why the guy falls for her, other than the fact that she seems to be available and drunk. And I have to say the abrupt ending threw me. Soafter spending almost two hours of my life, what's my takeaway here? Abortion good, hard work bad? Some guys will date almost anyone? What's the point in trying because I can't be as good as my mother? If this was indeed about abortion, as some seem to think, it doesn't get much air timeJenny says ""I thought about it"" and leaves it at that. We have no indication as to what thoughts entered her mind. The guy has no say. Really? The only likable character was her mother: was this to remind us that that ""Thirty-Something"" (where the actress gained fame and fortune) was actually a far superior show about young people? And I'm sorry, but why the title? ""Obvious Child""? Who's the child? Jenny? If it's the aborted baby, why on earth is he/she obvious? And if it's Jenny, are we supposed to celebrate that fact that she's 28 or so and totally clueless? Is that a good thing? Sorry, thumbs way down from me.",negative
Obvious Child,"Over the years, the film industry has churned out plenty of comedies about the perils of dealing with unexpected pregnancy, but never has the subject been approached from such a refreshingly different point of view than in Gillian Robespierre's Obvious Child. Donna (Jenny Slate) is an aspiring stand-up comedian whose relationship with her long-term boyfriend has just come to a screeching halt, courtesy of his philandering. Angry and despondent, Donna unleashes her frustration onstage, crashing and burning in front of the audience before finding solace in genuine nice guy Max (Jake Lacy), with whom she shares a few drinks - and a bed.When Donna discovers a few weeks later that she's pregnant, her life is thrown into upheaval. A child certainly isn't on her list of desired acquisitions, and after evaluating her options with best friend Nellie (Gaby Hoffmann), she elects to have an abortion. There's just one problem: Max, the one-night stand who also happens to be the sweetest, most courteous person Donna has ever met, and is obviously interested in more than just a casual fling.Obvious Child differs from other pregnancy rom-coms by approaching a uniquely feminine issue from a decidedly feminine point of view. This is Donna's story, and while the film is most definitely a comedy, it treats the subject matter with respect and dignity. It's also a standout performance from Slate, who runs the full gamut of the emotional spectrum, gleefully reveling in Donna's raunchy stand-up act one moment, and losing herself in a tearjerking scene between Donna and her overbearing (but not unloving) mother in the next.Obvious Child will likely bear the unfortunate distinction of being known as ""the abortion movie,"" but to oversimplify the film and marginalize it in such a manner is a huge disservice. Yes, it deals with abortion, but more importantly, it deals with womanhood in a way that few films have ever dared. It's an authentic, emotional, and yes, hilarious portrait of a young woman trying to find her way, and should be considered a landmark achievement in feminist filmmaking.-- Brent Hankins",positive

Infinitely Polar Bear,"I really thought this movie could be awesome, I love Mark Ruffalo, Zoe Saldana's pretty cool, the kids looked cute and I love indie movies and movies that are set in the 70s. But there really wasn't much to like about this film.As a previous reviewer said, the way that manic depression is depicted in this movie is too glib. Having a severely mentally ill person as the guardian of two children is more of a tragedy than a comedy. The movie kind of suggested that having a bipolar parent would be like a fun roller coaster ride with lots of exciting moments and singing.The most surprising element of this movie was that the children's characters were made to be so unlikeable. The two girls were extremely self-absorbed, cruel, and annoying towards their mentally ill father. I kept thinking that I would also go insane if I had those two for daughters. They whined and complained through the entire movie. The mentally ill dad would try to do something positive, and his daughters would scream at him, put him down, tell him his ideas were stupid and refuse to help. They seemed to be actively provoking him at times.I didn't get the point of this movie. I liked the costumes and the set design, but the story was really sub-par.",negative
Infinitely Polar Bear,"In the late 70's, in Boston, the bipolar Cameron ""Cam"" Stuart (Mark Ruffalo) lives with his mulatto wife Maggie (Zoe Saldana) and their daughters Amelia (Imogene Wolodarsky) and Faith (Ashley Aufderheide) in an isolated house in the countryside. When Cam is fired from his job, he has a mental breakdown and Maggie is forced to institutionalize him. When he is released, he moves to a small apartment while Maggie works to support the children. She decides to apply to an MBA to improve her income and she is accepted by the Columbia University in New York. She asks Cam to take care of the girls for eighteen months and he agrees despite his fears. Maggie moves to New York and Cam is responsible for Amelia and Faith education. Will the scheme work?""Infinitely Polar Bear"" is a heartwarming film with outstanding performances. The dramatic situation of Cameron is shallow, but the movie is delightful to watch. Just as a curiosity, the girl Imogene Wolodarsky is the daughter of the director Maya Forbes. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Sentimentos que Curam"" (""Feelings that Heel"")",positive
Sex Actually,"I'd turn up the rating on this film to 11 if my amp went that high: it's really that good. Superlatives are overused and not always helpful, so I'll give some comparative praise: it's the first film to make me laugh harder than either Mel Brooks' ""Young Frankenstein"" or the 'Bigus Dickus' scene in Monty Python's ""Life of Brian""... It was as touching and romantic as ""Love Actually"" or Baz Luhrman's ""Moulin Rouge"" (if not more so); had as many wrenching and completely unpredictable twists and turns as the best of Hitchcock, and the ending had a twist guaranteed to be as surprising as anything you've seen—except that the end first took a quick 90-degree turn before hitting you with a 180. The writer-director, Josh Lawson, has produced a truly perfect little masterpiece with ""The Little Death"", full of subtlety, whimsy, good humor and genuinely side-splitting comedy. It's not for everyone, but I can't recommend this film highly enough.",negative
Sex Actually,"The first thing I did after watching the film was check social media - was it just me or did everyone else agree this was a great flick? Happily it wasn't just me, I couldn't find a bad tweet. Yes, it's an awkward topic, and not that I'm a prude but I did have trepidations about going to see a movie about sexual fetishes. But actually, that's what gave it it's humour, along with the incredible performances by not one, but every single cast member. At no time did I wish that we went back to one of the other story lines because each one was engaging in its own right. The film somehow manages to be light hearted and appealing to adults of all ages, while at the same time meandering through sophisticated undertones and delivering a few thought provoking messages. This is not just a fantastic example of Australian talent, it is a brilliant movie.",positive

Kabir Singh,"This movie is about a guy who has uncontrollable anger and nobody has been able to control his anger being a top medical student. He does things for a girl which is totally unrealistic and extremely open. The girl seems to be so dumb to accept anything and everything he says and he does.
They seem to be madly in love that the scenes are mainly about being intimate without having any meaningful conversation.The guy and the girl wants to get married but are not able to do so due to family pressure. Families seem little logical here. The guy's family has not been able to control him for any of his actions.In latter part, psycho has gone crazy after girl has been forcefully married by her parents.
He gets into more and more trouble. Family gets little bothered now.
There is a happy ending for such a dark story which is unacceptable.Sad part : the guy never got treated in rehab and was never declared psycho.Good part : Hero 's acting is awesome so one point for that.",negative
Kabir Singh,"Ok, Kabir Singh is not your picture perfect protagonist and neither the director tried to show him in that light.It's about a guy who's not perfect, has anger issues but has fallen in love and doesn't want to move on after he's hurt. For him, she is everything.It's not your KJO type movie wherein the protagonist is a hero who won't do a bad thing, his families are happy with him, his neighbors are happy and the entire college or city is happy with him.It's a story about a flawed person which is totally normal in real life. Don't we have such friends or colleagues or people around us who we may not like but they are like that? So, if you feel it's patriarchal and misogynistic, it is but it is that story about that man! Period.Through his perspective, we realized he was pure and didn't believe in casteism that comes in the way of love. Have we not come across that? Do we not become partial to other castes? My own marriage had almost become a victim of casteism but we held our own and now happily married for many years.We saw a full circle of Kabir who was a sensitive child in love with a doll but was also possessive. We saw how he became protective for a new girl in college and she being a docile, submissive girl also fell in love with him. She loved him. It's not like he forced himself on her.He got hurt, did wrong things but still was a man of morals and came out clean when needed. He acknowledged himself that's the only thing he liked about himself.His coming of age while talking to his father when the latter was down in his life, shows his character development wonderfully written by Vanga. I'm his fan now.Lots of hints are thrown out in open here's a guy with so many issues is the topper of his college, did what the society wanted of him which is to be topper, study well, be a doctor but then he didn't give a damn about what he wanted to do in his personal life and what others thought of him.Other things he did when he did while womanizing he was broken and hurt. People when hurt deal with their issues differently. While some throw their phones on the floor in anger, others may just tell themselves to get up and go. Was he right? It's about his story and life, not ours.Need to view that story from that perspective and feel his pain and disagree where you didn't like it. But you can't say it's glorifying his wrong deeds.Was Padmavat glorifying Khilji's work or GoT glorifying nudity and butchering?I loved this new type of love story. The team worked hard and I loved all the characters in the film especially his friend Shiva - a true real raw friendship.Kiara was beautiful and could be the next big sensation as Disha did after MS Dhoni.Shahid can finally be sure his father is proud of his work. Never felt it was him and not Kabir for a second.Request to the viewers to not be judgemental and watch it for what it is. Mind you, you'd not be disappointed. Peace!",positive
A United Kingdom,"A great history lesson I am sure most of us were not taught and are not aware of.A United Kingdom was very well done, straight to the point without throwing in of unnecessary embellishments...as films are known for when it comes to true to life stories. I prefer the facts with a bit of flare but when it comes to history; hopefully, someday film makers will come to the realization a lot of extra fluff does not make the story more interesting it just muds up the facts. I suppose there is a fine line between a movie and a documentary. This movie was perfectly told.David Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike couldn't play their parts better, they were exemplary. Good choice of actors.A well deserved 10/10.",negative
A United Kingdom,"I lived in Botswana for twenty-five odd years and enjoyed every single moment of it, almost certainly due in large measure to Seretse's enlightened politics and the genuine and natural warmth of the Botswana people. I knew both main characters quite well. Seretse was a very approachable man, even as president, and it was a pleasure to spend some time in his company. He was a man well loved by everyone, black and white. In fact, in Botswana one scarcely thought in those terms. As a politician he had huge charisma and was a great orator. He was also a born leader. I remember well being told by insiders that government Ministers who were in trouble for minor abuse of office or the like, would tremble in fear outside his office when they were to be 'carpeted'.Ruth was an extraordinarily capable woman and even in her later years had more stamina than almost anyone I have known. She was at work in her office in Gaborone from early morning to the end of the day, patron of the Red Cross, Botswana Council of Women etc etc. Contrary, however, to one reviewer's criticism, Rosalind Pike's portrayal was quite accurate. She was not a strident campaigner but a very effective mover who enjoyed a social life and had many friends. In her widowhood she received constant visits from senior members of the tribe and government and was widely loved and respected by her people. She was most certainly ""Mohumagadi"" - Mother of the Nation.This film portrays their personalities pretty accurately and the characterisation of the actors is extraordinarily true to life. Both David Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike were absolutely convincing. The quality of the acting very quickly overcame my initial niggling concern that the physical likenesses were not quite there. The photography of Botswana was outstanding and the familiar views of Serowe from the Palapye 'road' and the scenes in the kgotla were quite emotional for me; I unexpectedly found I had a lump in my throat.I can understand that, for others, the film may not have the immediacy it has for me, perhaps, but previous criticisms of 'cold' and 'unemotional' - No! Leaving aside my personal interest, it deserved to be the opener for the London Film Festival. Maybe not a total ""blockbuster"" but an unusual and great film nonetheless. Very close to fact.",positive
Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety,"According to the movie's perspective, marriage will break the bro-code between besties Sonu and Titu. The two chaddi buddies aren't lovers but they are emotional soul mates. Director Luv Ranjan goes a step further - the entire film is about a friend trying to break up his best friend's marriage because he believes that the woman his friend is marrying is a fraud. Sonu has no proof that Sweety is problematic. He says, it's just a feeling. She is, in his words, too good to be true.
 The actors - Kartik Aaryan, Sunny Singh and Nushrat Bharucha - try to make this juvenile bromance versus romance drama convincing. Nushrat is saddled with an underwritten character. Kartik works hard to make Sonu likeable but it's an uphill climb. Sunny is the best among the three - he has an easy, unassuming presence. I just wish his character had more spine.In once scene, Sweety tells Sonu that dosti aur ladki mein hamesha ladki jeetti hai. But in the Luv Ranjan's universe, women don't stand a chance.",negative

Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani,"The much awaited Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani didn't quite match my expectations. Honestly, I expected a more polished story from Ayan Mukherji who had given us a thoughtful and feel-good coming-of-age film like Wake Up Sid earlier. YJHD seems like a rehash of the classic rom-com Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge in more ways than one. Here too, you have a hero who is a spoilt brat and wants to enjoy life to the fullest and a heroine who is a book- a-holic and obeys her parents to death. They decide to travel across the country with friends and end up falling in love with each other just at the moment when they have to go back to their respective homes. While the first half is pretty much told from the perspective of the heroine, the second half focuses more on the hero's life. What Ayan Mukherji succeeds at is how he neatly etched the four characters of Ranbir Kapoor, Deepika, Aditya Roy Kapur and Kalki Koechlin. You can see sparks of brilliance in several scenes, especially when Ranbir's friends find out about his scholarship. But, that alone is not enough for making a great film. The film seems quite boring at certain points. Thankfully, Pritam's music succeeds in elevating our moods and is quite hummable. And Ayan has also captured some terrific locations which add beauty to the film.As mentioned earlier, I wanted a much more diligent film from a talented director of Ayan's caliber. The film might cater to teenagers and youths who want a breath of fresh air after a hackneyed week. But the film won't find any takers in serious film critics.",negative
Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani,"Like all rom-coms, YEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI sparkles with romance, merriment and heartache, is brightly glossy and boasts of crackling chemistry between its lead actors, but Ayan makes sure the heady concoction never waters down. The best part is, he never borrows from romantic clichés that most love stories depend upon and that, in my opinion, is this film's biggest strength. Expect no unwanted melodrama, no unwelcome characters, no earsplitting background music to accentuate the proceedings... On the whole, YEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI is a revitalizing take on romance and relationships. A wonderful cinematic experience, this one should strike a chord with not just the youth, but cineastes of all age-groups. Watch this celebration of love and get mesmerized!",positive
Beyond the Lights,I resent the people who think this is a chick flick. Maybe it is but I'm a 30 year old woman and was not impressed. I really wanted to like this film having heard such great things about but it was so boring. One cliché after another. Kid who wants to be a star? Check. Over bearing stage mom? Check. Mental breakdown? Check. Guy who comes to save the day? Check. Nothing original about this film. You've seen it many times before. All the attempts to Make us think fame is not as great as it seems fall super flat and the main character just comes off ungrateful. There's really only one incident in the whole film that makes you feel sorry for her. I don't know what else to say about this film. Forgettable. The one stand out is Minnie driver who i didn't know could play such a bitch. Well done! (Also backstory would have been nice. Was dad black? Was she adopted? That also really bugged me the whole film),negative
Beyond the Lights,"This movie from start to finish was nothing short of amazing. Very here and now. Very real. Gugu and Nate Parker gives an exceptional performance in their roles. Even though I come from a very different life than Noni, I could relate to her feelings of not being seen or heard. I found myself feeling sorry for Noni, but wanting her so desperately to rise above all of it and find her own voice and embrace herself. I so appreciate how Gugu caused me as the viewer to feel every scene as if I am right there. I hope she continues to make great films. She was amazing in ""Belle"" and she surely did not disappoint in this one. Great job cast, writers, directors and producers of this film! I definitely plan to add this one to my video library when it comes out on DVD.",positive
How to Write Love,"Early this year, this reviewer went to see the 2013 film 'Love Is the Perfect Crime', a French-language film about a student-seducing literature professor, with plenty of bloody murder and mayhem. By contrast 'The Rewrite', from Castle Rock, is a gentle comedy set in the academic world of Binghamton, New York.'The Rewrite' tells the story of a washed-up script-writer who is forced to take up a job teaching script-writing. The decent trailer for this film shows this, and the selection procedure for the class, which we quickly get to, and so gives you a good idea what to expect in the film. Hugh Grant plays the part of this writer-turned-teacher.Hugh Grant has previously given us classic comedies, such as 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' (1994), 'Mickey Blue Eyes' and 'Notting Hill' both of 1999, and 'About a Boy' (2002). In 'AaB', Mr Grant played a one-hit-wonder pop-star trying to fill the rest of his life, so this role is somewhat similar.In a recent interview Mr Grant described how his life had taken a dramatic change in recent years, which forced him into political activity, thus also forcing him into having a much lesser role in the movie business. With regard to 'The Rewrite', Mr Grant said that audience reaction now made him realize that his age prevented him from playing certain scenes, and one true-life scene had him looking back unable to capture his former glory.Thus this film, 'The Rewrite', in reality, can be seen as a turning point, where the previously foppish young Hugh Grant, has now turned into the now mature Hugh Grant. This real-life journey for Mr Grant, is one that is also faced by his character in this film, thus does the art imitate real-life.The realistic scenario for this film was written by Marc Lawrence, who previously wrote the classic 'Miss Congeniality' (2000). One cannot help wonder how autobiographical the one-hit-wonder script-writer plot is. Certainly all the Hollywood-related scenes have a truly authentic feel to them. Marc Lawrence, who directed, as well as wrote, this film, and actor Hugh Grant, have given us a vision of life that seems very believable.What must be stated, is how good Mr Lawrence's script is. Nearly every line is clever and funny, though if you laugh-out-loud you may miss the next line. There are also some poignant moments in the film too, and these are expertly directed, and are expertly conveyed to us, sometimes just by using silence. Tremendous! Director Marc Lawrence is Brooklyn-born, as is leading-lady Marisa Tomei. Miss Tomei did the lovely rom-coms 'My Cousin Vinny' (1992) and 'Only You' (1994). In more recent years, she did the more serious 'Before The Devil Knows You Are Dead' (2007) and 'The Wrestler' (2008). Miss Tomei turned down appearing in the 1994 film 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'. Here, at last, she plays opposite Hugh Grant.Miss Tomei's character is an optimistic and pushy mature-student, with a very full life. However, unlike Jason Alexander's 'Seinfeld' character George Costanza, who admitted ""I have a thing for Marisa Tomei"" in 'Seinfeld' (Series 7, Episode 14), Hugh Grant's student-seducing character strangely seems unable to lift his eyes from the young bit-of-skirt to see Marisa Tomei. ""What's not to like!"" as George would say. NB Castle Rock made 'Seinfeld'.The plot of 'The Rewrite' has our jaded LA-based script-writer relocating to small-town Binghamton. Thus, it is similar in theme to 'Groundhog Day' (1993), in which the jaded weather-man has to leave New York to meet Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog, in ""rural Pennsylvania"". How appropriate it is then that this similar rom-com plot, again has Chris Elliott in a supporting role.There is also good support from the supporting-cast who make up the motley-crew of the screen-writing class. Serious actor JK Simmons, who has appeared regularly in several of the Law & Order TV franchises, and who terrified us in the TV series 'Oz', here gets to do some touching comedy. Allison Janney too, gives strong support.Australian-born Bella Heathcote has the biggest part in the writing-class, and she acts it well, but perhaps the more poignant scenes were with Andrew Keenan-Bolger, and particularly, Steven Kaplan, who was in the best scene in the film.The clever and funny script teaches us a little about the English language, script-writing, and life in general. Suitable to those in education, and also those interested in film-making, as well as all others, this film is surprisingly realistic, and has a clever and funny script, as well as some thought-provoking moments.What's not to like! 10/10.PS. Jumping out of my seat at the start of the credits, this reviewer nearly missed some nice scenes that accompanied the credits, so do stay to catch them, as they are well worth seeing.",negative
How to Write Love,"Hugh Grant is an icon and icons get older too, like the rest of us mortals. Here's a wonderful movie portraying a 'has been' screenplay writer in Hollywood struggling through life, divorced and no clue how to be a dad to his 18 year old son, which he didn't speak to for over a year. He hits rock bottom and is forced to teach at a remote university upstate New York to pay his bills.In the bumpy process through it all he realizes that teaching gives him a true perspective on his own life and enjoyment for being valued by his students. He finds peace in not juggling anymore in Tinseltown. The script is magnificent, it tells a story through a comic lens with a melodramatic touch. It's a a classic romantic comedy with lots of nice movie clichés. Hugh Grant didn't loose his touch, he matured and accepts it, the floppy hair turned grey. Excellent casting by the way. Nice to see Marisa Tomei, Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons in a supporting role.",positive

Padmaavat,"Sanjay Leela Bhansali strikes yet another visually mesmerising sight with the 2hr 43min Padmaavat. Spread across Afghanisthan, Singhal and Rajasthan, each and every frame of the movie is visually stunning and is a treat for the eyes, including the actors, who look flawless. 
As for the actors in the film, Rani Padmavati(Deepika Padukone) puts up a good performance, with amazing dialogues. However, I expected some more screentime from her, and an even grittier performance. She looks bold and beautiful, but her real performance shone at the climax, which was again blown a tad too much, I felt. 
Ranveer Singh gives a brilliant performance once more as Allaudin Khilji. He portrays the vociferous, eccentric and ruthlessness of the character with ease, and nails it in every frame. Every slight action of his oozes out his character. His best so far.
Raja Ratan Singh(Shahid Kapoor) is simply brilliant as the valiant king of Mewar. His bravery shone in his eyes, and dialogue delivery was on point. Why was he given such a small screentime? Was expecting to see him much more. He was simply amazing.
Also, the movie stretched a tad bit long, and Shahid and Deepika's chemistry faltered.

The Railway Man,Moving drama based on the WWII experiences of Eric Lomax a Prisoner of War forced to work on a railway in Burma following the fall of Singapore to the Japanese.Lomax is played in two time-lines by Jeremy Irvine in the war and Colin Firth in his older years.He and his colleagues endure severe torture at the hands of their Japanese soldier captors forcing severe post traumatic stress disorder long after the war has ended.Lomax is a railway geek hence the title of the film. His demons come back to haunt him once he finds love with Patti (a rather boring Nicole Kidman) and the identity of one of his torturers is revealed as still being alive by wartime friend Finlay (Swedish Stellan Skarsgard). After travelling back to the site of his capture he finds forgiveness to the Japanese 'translator' soldier.The story is very interesting and emotional but the trouble with Colin Firth films I find is he plays pretty much the same character in all of them. A broody stiff upper lip Englishman. The film has a documentary feel like an episode of Michael Portillos Railway Journeys but on the whole provides a worthy film to watch.,negative
The Railway Man,"I read the short storyline of the film before viewing and it had intrigued me. I came into it with an open mind - at first romance and then the inescapable drama. The acting by Firth was amazing. I was mesmerized. It may be slow (to some of a lesser attention span) at first, but eased into a psychological drama that holds on tight and will not release until the finale. Spectacular cinematography, the scenes are beautiful and real. It is a wake up call to those who have not/do not understand the great span of WWII - brings much needed insight into the history of this particular banker's war. Ultimately, this film beautifully portrays the ultimate power of forgiveness. Which brought tears to my eyes, in the panic and hysteria that the world now feels due to war and terror, it is good to know that there is some shred of humanity that exists and has hope to exist in the future.",positive
Table 19,"Trailers are notorious in over-promising for movies that under-deliver. But every now and then, one pops up that does the opposite. The trailer for Table 19 (2017) gives the impression of a lightweight romantic comedy with a touch of slapstick, all framed around a wedding. Despite being critically panned by many, there is more to this unexpectedly entertaining low-profile film than meets the eye.The heroine is Eloise (Anna Kendrick) who, against her better judgement, accepts a wedding invitation knowing she is persona non-grata with the bridal party. She was recently dumped by the bride's brother, who is now the best man, and she is suddenly no longer the bride's best friend. She was the chief helper with the reception planning and knows who is at every table and why they are here. Her companions on Table 19 comprise a lovable granny-type, two oddballs, and a quarrelling married couple. They were all expected to decline their invitation but still send a gift, and that alone is a recipe for humour and satire. Their distance from the bridal table and proximity to the toilets quickly establishes their lowly social status and the comic sketches play on social awkwardness. The thread of continuity is through Eloise and her manhunts. The standard sit-com one-liners and the obligatory near-catastrophe with a wedding cake are neither original nor particularly funny, but the situation develops a warm emotional undercurrent that is unexpectedly touching.One of the interesting things about this film is the difference between its plot and story. The plot is standard wedding reception comedy which laughs at the marginalisation of unwanted guests. On the other hand, the story explores why the Table 19'ers are together. It offers insight into their lives, their personalities, and the emotional hurt caused by being placed on the social fringe. The best part of the film is when the offended ""randoms"" leave the reception for a while to console each other. Through flashbacks we get the back-story to their invitations which range from pathetic to comic. For example, the granny-type really believed she was invited because the bride fondly remembered her first baby-sitter, but the bride barely knows who she is. There is also a wannabe trying to lose his virginity, a weird guy straight out of prison, and a couple who are far from an inspiring example of a loving marriage.Anna Kendrick plays the perfect balance between awkward, aggrieved, and aggressive, and the randoms are standard comic stereotypes. But while our eyes are on Elosie, the warmth of the story come from her table companions. The gags are at snicker level rather than belly laughs and the cinematography is colourful and cluttered as wedding receptions often are. There is no shortage of embarrassing moments as Eloise stalks her men, both old and new, and the final scenes rise through melodrama to operatic farce. But this film offers a fresh take on standard rom-com themes in amusing and entertaining ways. and it might make you think twice if you need to create a seating plan.",negative
Table 19,"I confess I find weddings tedious at the best of times but we always go with a sense of optimism.Anna Kendrick's character was clearly on the fence about attending but decided to be brave and attend. She is seated at the table of people who were surprised to get an invitation and we learn that she is the best man's ex-girlfriend and former Maid of Honour for this event.Nobody beautiful, rich or influential is at table 19. It turns out they are all at a turning point in their lives and the story evolves about their various crisis.These people are all amazing in their on right and their stories are interesting (far more interesting than any the beautiful people have).#The soundtrack is well chosen and the spark of sensuality provided when Huck and Eloise dance is well done.The wedding isn't dressed up as a great event - its an ordinary American wedding and thankfully, there is a limited amount of it.I can't recommend it highly enough, in a time when films have no script at all",positive
In Your Eyes,"In Your Eyes (2014)A terrific concept—and it unveils early on but if you don't know it it's a great surprise—and a well done movie, too. The key is the two main actors, a young man and a young woman in very different circumstances who seem destined for each other.And they are 3000 miles apart. Zoe Kazan (granddaughter of the director) is terrific throughout, playing a well- heeled woman with a controlling husband in beautiful New Hampshire. And Michael Stahl-David plays her counterpart with similar introspective intensity, but as an minor ex-con in a trailer in beautiful New Hampshire. What they have in common is something no one else has—and no one else can know about.It's the ultimate romance movie in that first sense that you know they belong together and circumstances are keeping them apart. But it's also a romance in a deeper way, because the two get to know each other with extreme openness and intimacy. They naturally fall in love. And the world naturally will not make it easy.In many ways the filming is quite solid in a familiar way, not drawing attention to itself except in scenes where two realities are made to blend (crudely). This is all about story and more story. Some of the side characters are imperfectly developed (even the controlling husband doesn't always resonate quite right). But the two leads are spot on, and their parallel development is our fascination.",negative
In Your Eyes,"What I hate about happy ending in every movie I watch is the fact that the story still isn't really over. What makes this movie so great is that the ending was built up to so well, it was at the point in the storyline I wanted it to end at.What I love about this movie is how by the end of the movie I was left feeling like the only way they could live and be happy, was together and the fact that a connection they've had since birth brings them together. I don't consider myself much of a romantic but there's something about being fated to be with someone and the idea that sharing your life with the right person, THE person, will give me my own happy ending and that just makes me gush.The casting was amazing especially Zoe Kazan who certainly wasn't hard to look at. If you're on the border on whether or not to watch this all you need to know is its a romantic film and its amazing!",positive

I hate him for being so stupid, by the second half of the movie I wanted to poison him myself!I'm not sure what the intrigue is supposed to be in this film.

My Cousin Rachel,"At an age (late 40s) when sadly many actresses start to find it tougher to obtain decent roles, Rachel Weisz is really coming into her own with central roles in films like ""Denial"" and now ""My Cousin Rachel"". Based on the 1951 novel by English writer Daphne du Maurier (previously filmed in 1952) and both scripted and directed by South African-born Roger Mitchell, this is a Hitchockian- type work, full of intrigue and mystery in a bucolic 19th century context. Throughout the narrative, we are presented with information which forces the viewer to revise constantly one's view as to whether the eponymous relative is a callous and scheming malevolent or totally misjudged and misunderstood. In a wonderful performance, Weisz enables us to be equally convinced by both interpretations. The work is embellished by well-acted support roles (notably by young Sam Claflin) plus excellent cinematography and some graphic countryside.",positive

L'amant double,"What comes out of Hollywod is complete trash. While Ozon has made a provocative movie about female sexual empowerment.The director has made a lot of movies about female empowerment. This movie is about female sexual liberation. Loosely based"" on the Joyce Carol Oates novel Lives of the Twins . ""I think the English are twisted enough to understand this movie,"" quipped director François Ozon. Ozon is going to go down in history as one of the all greats, as a film director. You will have to watch it a few times to see all the subtle cues. The movie is about a woman and her two lovers. Symbolism for two sides of personality. What is real or nor real is left to your imagination. The theme is about sexual female empowerment. Being dominate and submissive. She wears a dildo while making love to her partner after she sees him with another woman. Being a voyeur and physically aroused , on top (cowgirl), while watching her reflection in the window. She is unhappy with her partner being meek and passive. Knowing in her mind, her other imagined or real jealous lover makes her hot and desired, will thrust harder and deeper during sex, ejaculate harder and gives her the female sexual fulfillment of a women, whose sexual capacity is far greater than that of her male.lover. Where she actually prefers a more sexually aggressive lover who will dominate her. Someone she can't control. There are lots of cues. Right at the start she cuts her long hair, being a former model and goes for a more androgynous look. Partly male and partly female in appearance; of indeterminate sex.There is a cat in the movie which is metaphorically obvious. Does the cat come out to play? Euphemism for vagina. In one scene, in the movie, the director shows us a close up of the vagina. In another scene, the camera seems to travel down her mouth and into her oesophagus. "" I saw the inside of her mouth and I realised that the larynx looked like a clitoris. It was a big surprise for me that the vocal cords look like a vagina. It was in the spirit of the film"" says director François Ozon.The film is about the subconscious of a woman and deals with sexuality, her exploration of sexuality. Exploring her sexuality - domination and submission.",positive
Austenland,"Did you ever watch the first five minutes of a movie, and realize that for every ten more minutes you watched, your IQ would drop eleven points? Austenland is such a movie. When Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dumber were standing there at the airport and the ""nineteenth century"" taxi arrived, I knew if I saw the rest of this film I would wind up brain-dead. It isn't funny, except in ways that awful movies are funny in an unintended sort of way. In other words the writing, acting and directing are so bad you laugh your tutu off. Austenland is such a movie. There are wonderful comedies out there, fantastic period dramas and historical masterpieces. Austenland is not one of them. Avoid!",negative
Austenland,"I am not sure why this film has received such low reviews. The film opens up with Mrs. Wattlesbrook (Jane Seymour) holding a fake lamb and talking about Austenland, which I think greatly sets the tone for what type of movie this is going to be. Going into the film, I knew it had received a low score thus lowering my expectations greatly so I wasn't expecting much. It turns out I didn't need to lower my expectations, this film totally went over and above.The critics and everyone leaving a low score have no sense of humor! It's over the top, exaggerated, hilarious, ridiculous, it's supposed to be that way! None of it is believable and once you allow yourself to enter the world of Austenland, you'll enjoy the film. The theater possibly has a lot to do with the tone. We had a great audience, everyone was cracking up, loud uproars in all the scenes, it was hilarious. Miss Elizabeth Charming is hysterical! I really enjoyed Jennifer Coolidge's performance, she really did her usual thing and it was wonderful. Lady Amelia Heartwright, Colonel Andrews, Captain George East all are so ridiculous and entertaining. The actors all did an amazing job. I honestly have not laughed that hard in a film in a long time. I'm talking laugh out loud, bursting, crying, snort kind of laughing. Even my husband enjoyed himself and found many of the scenes very entertaining.I know I haven't talked much about the actual movie but bottom line: it's HILARIOUS. Go in with an open mind, allow yourself to be silly, let go of how ""unrealistic"" it is, and you'll be in for a treat.",positive
Teströl és lélekröl,"A 'Love Story' I don't think so. A superficial exploration or exploitation of a young woman with a profound disability. For such a vulnerable supposedly compassionate man he hardly protects her from workplace bullying and shows little insight into her struggle to communicate, relate to to others or to feel emotions.

And what a story it is! Slow, vulnerable, awkward, beautiful, painful. You can smell the sweat and blood ad life. 
It may be too intimate and fallible for some prople's taste, though all those inconvenient details adds to the story and the feeling. It peaks in chatarsis multiple times during the movie, still the ending is a bit too obvious for my taste (especially when one contrasts that to how clever the movie was during its slow expansion in the previous hour and half)
Still this is a masterpiece: multilayered, well acted, well shot. Bruising yet uplifting. What more one may ask from a movie.
Update: initially I rated this 9/10 due to some nitpicking on technical issues like pacing at the end. After a week of haunting images, memories and feelings in its wake, I say this movie is the real deal: so here it is 10/10 (like M. Lazhar.)",positive
The Immigrant,"i cannot believe this movie got no Oscar consideration this year. both Joaquin phoenix and Marion cottilard deserved Oscar nominations for best actor and actress. i like this movie over "" American hustle "" and Joaquin's performance was brutally good, especially the last few moments of the movie where it was not sappy but i wanted to cry anyway. it is a f*ucked-up world we live in an its very hard not to desensitize ourselves, which to a degree everybody does.OK, this movie probably had a lot of production problems, like one of the reviewers said that he caught the 95 min. version and i actually watched the 2 hr. version and that was to short of a running time. this has the feel of an epic movie and the actors and actresses were superb in this movie. i think someone needs to hang or shoot the scriptwriter cause everything else about the movie was awesome.the basic story is set in early 1920's new york city,and its about 2 sisters from Poland( how good is Marion's polish? ) immigrating to America and arriving on Ellis island. her younger sister is sick and quarantine and waiting to recover and be deported. she is about to be deported also because her sponsors( aunt and uncle )never arrived to pick them up. in swoops Joaquin phoenix to rescue the day and get her out of Ellis island and to downtown Manhattan. oh...BTW, did i mention that he is a pimp and hustler and finds a lot of the girls fresh of the boat who are in dire situations by bribing the guards....that is as far as i want to go with the story, it really is a must see movie but make sure you get the longest version possible not the 95 min. one. this movie dwells on the darker side of immigrant life and that America is not the utopia everybody makes it out to be. the streets ain't paved with gold and life was often very hard.i want to give a shout-out for jeremy renner, he looks very debonaire and suave with the short-cut and the pencil moustache. he played the lovable loser cousin of phoenix and was a delight.why no Oscar consideration for this movie this year??????. this movie had 3 a-list actors who gave very good performances, set production was gorgeous( everything looked dreary and old like its suppose to ). i don't know if there was cgi involved for the Ellis island scenes, but it was very well done and even new york city in the 1920's was well done. the last scene between Marion and Joaquin is worth the price of admission alone and i just wish this bittersweet movie was at least a 1/2 hr. longer.maybe it'll make next years Oscars as it has not officially been released here in the states yet and they can fix it up before then, it just needs a little touching-up here and there thats all.wanna watch a really good movie? well this is one of the best of the year in my opinion. enjoy!",negative
The Immigrant,"A complex, nuanced, deeply affecting tale of morality and survival in 1920's New York. This is American cinema at it's finest. Nothing is black/white or good/evil in James Gray's films, instead we see intensely emotional portraits of real people struggling for happiness. Again, religion plays a central role in his work and the message, at least to me, seems to be: there is no god, there is only you. Somehow Marion Cotillard keeps getting better and better and digging deeper into her characters. She is far and away the best actress out there and continues to work with the finest filmmakers. Her confession scene in this movie was stunning, beautiful- the best shot of the year. When the credits rolled i wasn't sure what i was feeling but i knew it was worthy of deep contemplation. Pure class, pure cinema.",positive
Our Souls at Night,"The last time Robert Redford and Jane Fonda starred together in a movie, The Electric Horseman, I was only a kid but I knew both actors were big film stars.Now in the twilight of their career Redford and Fonda come together in the screen once more in Our Souls at Night and you can sense that these two people are comfortable with each other, after all this is the fourth film they have made together.This is a low key, no frills film set in a small Colorado town. Fonda plays Addie Moore, a widow who just wants companionship especially at night. One night she knocks on Louis Waters (Redford) door and makes a proposition that they just share a bed together but nothing sexual. Waters is also widowed and lonely. Although both have lived near each other for years the families were never close and he considers her proposal and takes her up on it.Louis is worried about small time gossip which is led by his friends in the coffee shop, Dorlan (Bruce Dern) teases him which makes Lois feel uncomfortable.As the film progresses so does their relationship and the backstory. Addie lost a child to a hit and run accident. Louis meanwhile had cheated on his wife, the infidelity caused ructions in his relationship with his family.When Addie's grown up son Gene (Matthias Schoenaerts) has marital and business issues, he drops off his son Jamie (Iain Armitage) to stay with her for a short while. This is the catalyst that brings both Louis and Addie closer, although Gene makes his dislike of Louis very clear.This is a simple albeit a slow autumnal drama with no histrionics. Director Ritesh Batra knows that he just needs his legendary actors to light up the screen. The Belgian actor Schoenaerts feels miscast, Dern is a hoot in his cameo as the chief gossip and Armitage shows what a rising talent he is as Fonda's grandson.",negative
Our Souls at Night,"Don't agree with the 1-star reviewer. It's a beautiful film, with 2 great actors acting their AGE. No doddering, just honest raw emotion.

Sierra Burgess Is a Loser,"After seeing 'To all the boys I loved before' I had a lot of hope for this movie. But, not even Noah Centineo can save it. The idea of the movie to show ""it's not about what's on the outside"" standpoint-but- the way they tried to prove it was just straight up weird. 
1) it was literally catfishing a guy to the fullest extent. They have a tv show for this specifically to show how gross and weird it is. Imagine going in to kiss a girl and *spoiler* her closing your eyes and then some other person you've never met before kisses you instead??? I would freak out but idk about you 
2) the only good part of this movie was seeing Veronica turn into a good person. Even though she helped carry on the weird catfishing, she turned into the nice girl that ended up saving the movie 
3) Jamey ended up taking her to the dance??? Like okay did she not just catfish you?? Like what if she was a 50 year old balding man, would you still have taken him to the dance?? Overall this movie was so weird and romanticized catfishing. Spoiler alert to life most catfishes are fat old men behind a screen in their moms basement and don't actually like you.",positive
Strange Magic,"If you look at the statistics of IMDb votes, you will find that Strange Magic unfortunately falls into the category of ""either you love it or hate it"" - very few in-betweeners.From a graphical animation viewpoint it is superb, with well thought out details backed by a lot of hard work. For adult viewers who like animations (like me of course!) the plot, musicality and characters are significantly above the average animation, with a well-balanced socially and politically conscious theme.The immense flake it has got in the media and the ""hate it"" viewers are totally unwarranted. Its main problem is the strong disconnect between its actual adult theme and characterization, vs the way it is portrayed and marketed as a family animation - a sort of fairy tale mummy bring kiddies to - and you can see many of the complainers fall directly into this category.In other words, it 'looks like' animation for kids, but the plot and dialogue is totally way too adult.... which is exactly what keeps it interesting for me! Kudos to Mr Lucas for doing this - just too bad the real target market segment of ""adults who like fairy tale animation"" is just too small for it to make any commercial impact. But... thanks all the same!",negative
Strange Magic,"I absolutely love this film, but I'll admit it may not be everyone's cup of tea. Pretty much non-stop singing through the first half and some odd song placement can be a bit jarring to some people. Overall though, it's a very cute and BEAUTIFULLY animated film with some great humor, on point voice acting, and top notch singing. Off beat in the best of ways with very memorable characters that really make the movie. I LOOOOVE Bog King and Marianne and their interactions with each other. Just weird enough to be a cult classic, in my opinion. Definitely worth a shot, if you have an hour and a half to spare some day. You may just love it!",positive
Dear Zindagi,"Dear Zindagi is an awesome experience. Truly, an experience to be lived. Alia carries all the film on her own shoulders, with SRK giving the required support. Alia has had a sensational year. So, let's first talk about the man who has had a pathetic run at the box office as well on the hearts of his audience for closely 2 years... SHAH RUKH KHAN. He is the man, who every girl will definitely love to have after watching this film. The extended cameo that he has, has been extremely important for the film. Just as the film is about to loose it's grip, SRK enters and changes everything. He had an unbelievable performance in FAN, and he has an unbelievable performance in Dear Zindagi too. Next, Alia is the soul of the film, who says the words of the youngsters today. The other appearances, which included Kunaal Kapoor, Angad Bedi, Ali Zafar and Aditya Roy Kapoor are extremely awesome to watch. TREAT.

Dear Zindagi,"Let me get this straight this is one of the best movies of year.. If an actor is making commercial movies more often than there comes a time in his life when audience get sick of his usual attitude towards selection of script.Then the actor starts to realize that now time has come to let everyone know that he got some acting skills.This was the situation of Shah Rukh Khan.His last few movies were all commercial with Fan being an exception.It was his time to return and shut all of his critics.But man o man how did he comeback.Truly sensational. Now let's get back to movie. Preview(No spoilers): Movie is about a girl who is desperate who is fighting all the hardships of life.Her on again off again love life until she meets this middle aged psychiatrist Jehangir which teaches her how to be free, how to say no to life, how to live it in your own way.Direction:As everybody here knows that movie's director is Gauri Shinde.She debuted with English Vinglish which was both commercial and critical success.This is Gauri's second directorial venture and she totally nailed it.Movie is almost as flawless as it gets.I rarely found a glitch in it.Indeed the movie shows her hard work. Acting:As movie's mainly focused on Alia Bhatt's character so let's first discuss her. She gives her truly best and her character was brought to life by her.She is god gifted and has a lot of talent. This girl will surely go a long way in her career. And then there is Shah Rukh Khan.I actually watched this movie because of him.Earlier this year his Fan was released.The movie didn't do well on Box Office but was a really great movie and SRK nailed both the characters.Like Fan he was the main highlight of the Dear Zindagi too.His sarcasm his cuteness and above all his acting in this movie is absolutely out of the world.As he faced a lot of criticism for Dilwal,Happy New Year,Chennai Express etc but now he is back to shut all of his critics.Cinematography:Movie does well in this section too.It was interesting how the story progressed with time. Story:Story is as simple as it gets and yet very complicated.It was very thought provoking.It changes the way you look at your life at your destiny.Story is pure work of class and hard work put in by Gauri Shinde.Overall:Overall the movie is very likable.Even hours later of watching it it stayed on top of my mind. Pros:+Shah Rukh back to his best. +Great and flawless story. +Cinematography +All the hard work put in by whole teamCons:None that I can find. At the end I strongly recommend it to everyone to go and watch this movie. Its one in a million type of movie.Don't miss it",positive
Magic in the Moonlight,"I kind of knew what I was getting into with a Woody Allen flick, but this movie was shockingly boring. I was actually startled by it. The actors totally phoned it in. Can't blame them, since the writing was so bad. After the King's Speech, not to mention Woody Allen's recent various exploits, I can only imagine that Colin Firth was offered an embarrassingly large pile of money to play this part. The central idea of the movie was shallow, lazily conceived and poorly explored. The dialogue meant to convey that idea was wooden and utterly unconvincing. These were some of the least engaging characters in a movie that I can think of. I absolutely did not care about them, what happened to them, or whether they would get together in the end. Just awful.",negative
Magic in the Moonlight,"I guess everyone of us had that moment in life when we realized that life isn't as magical as we had pictured it. That sometimes you can't talk yourself into believing something supernatural, something magical, but deep down you want to believe. What if you were finally convinced that there is more to the world than meets the eye? That is what happens to another at heart typical Woody Allen character Stanley, this time played by Colin Firth and he brings his English cynicism into the role. Known as debunker of myths and psychics he is enlisted by an friend to the French Riviera to prove a woman, that everyone is believing is a clairvoyant, to be fraud. As more time he spends with this woman Stanley starts to believe that she might be the real deal. and with that he is also turning into a nice person all of a sudden. Now that he's got something to believe in.Colin Firth is as usual cool as a cucumber but this he is actually likable and quite funny thanks to the always funny dialogue penned by Allen. Emma Stone is cute and funny as always. But what is real beautiful is the scenery of the French Riviera and the cinematography of Darius Khondji who has managed to capture the essence of Paris, Rome and now the south of France.The usual Wody Allen themes are quite prominent but still wrapped in this pleasant summer fare. Allen does get to tackle religion, belief, magic, the vast size of the universe and of course the unpredictability of love. Woody Allen is of the opinion that most of his films aren't perfect, that he never got to make the film he wanted. He has stated that only three of his films are as he envisioned them. In my opinion most of his films are perfect and flawless.",positive
Alex Strangelove,"The film seems hopeful during the first 10 minutes. After that the characters remain stagnant and one dimensional. Alex seems constantly alert and high strung (understandibly due to his dilemma), Clair is constantly disappointed, although it's hard to sympathise with her as her character doesn't evolve enough. Elliot character is unrealistic. The writers portray him initially as shy and mysterious, then he becomes extremely forward when trying to pursue alex, such behaviour is slightly intolerable.
he invites alex to a concert because ""Gretchen can't make it""he mysteriously appears at the same place as alex he offers to give alex a ride home he forcefully states ""you definitely need to come to my house"" when Alex doesn't know the song playing on the radio he summons alex to his bed knowing full well alex is in a relationshipand what erked me the most wad his sing along yo B-52s Dance this mess around. It was cringeworthy and just plain bizzare?? The movie finishes with, of course, the prom. Where Clair ""passes the torch"" (meaning passing Elliot to Alex) to show her support of their relationship, and is seemingly unaffected by what would likely be a devastating and heart breaking experience for anyone in the real world. Alex has one more hesitation prior to accepting his true self. Which means a quick run to the bathroom and hyperventilating. All hope seems lost when Elliot tries to leave right before.... Alex runs back and they embrace in a passionate kiss with everyone at prom speculating and being supportive. (I wish it were like that in the real world, unfortunately it's not)The only saving grace was the character of Dell who provided the main comic relief. However, some of his comments to Alex were slightly offensive and homophobic. The kids are great actors I'm sure, the script may have let them down.",negative

Dan Mazer tried far too hard to deliver what I'm sure he thought were amusing British comedy one liners but it was overdone, lacked originality and was frankly boring. Any acting skill was dwarfed by poor overburdened script writing which made authenticity difficult to execute.The scenes, characters, story line and plot have all been done far better in other British classics like Notting Hill and Four Weddings where everything gels beautifully. Here however is a mish-mash of nonsense that fails to deliver. I was tempted to switch off 10 minutes through but thought I may as well give it a shot. What a disappointment!This movie demonstrates a new non-comic genre of British film making which is too overdone to be funny, too unrealistic to be engaging and too irritating to be entertaining.

Breathe In,"This movie really failed to do anything besides show bad morality looks like. The entire premise of this movie is WRONG. The characters in this movie are not believable.Let's start with Keith (the father). Keith is a married man, with a job as a music teacher, who happens to not like teaching. So he is auditioning for first chair in the local orchestra. He gets the job, then decides to elope with Sophie (the exchange girl). First of all: you get the job you want, then, out of some undemonstrated hate for your kid AND your wife, you decide to elope with a stranger you met only a couple of weeks ago. Hmmmm... I totally believe this.Then Sophie (exchange girl). An girl goes on an exchange to the US, without really researching where she'll be staying (who the family is), then decides she will not play piano in the house she's staying at because she wants to ""have the choice"". So... you go on an exchange to study music... to not study music? How many students do you think do an exchange without researching the family where they're staying? Hmmm... I totally believe this.The actual movie was slow, and no real problem was ever presented. Only near the end, when Keith and Sophie decide to elope, is there some conflict; but Keith fails to address any of it with Megan (the wife). Things could have been SLIGHTLY interesting if we saw some kind of interaction addressing his eloping, but all we get is dry screenplay with little material to keep us watching. The movie is ridden with unnecessary family drama, violin concerts, and piano lessons. I don't recommend this movie whatsoever, unless you want to learn how to be a sex offender. Maybe go read Oedipus Rex, and you'll get a taste for how disgusting and implausible this is.",negative
Breathe In,"No mere love story, ""Breathe In"" is a quietly powerful film about two people who are eloquently and achingly swept up in a deep ""connection"" that defies description. To label this honest and beautiful film a ""family drama"" does it an injustice, but if that's what it is, then ""Breathe In"" is the best family drama I have ever seen. Felicity Jones as Sophie, the visitor, is captivating -- insightful, kind, and vaguely troubled. Sophie also happens to be a piano prodigy, perhaps an allusion to being a sort of ""prodigal daughter."" The film's atmosphere is masterful,an outstanding collaboration of cinematography, production design, and music. Breathe In maintains tension without ever becoming shrill,oppressive, or melodramatic, a balance that has been difficult to strike in so many of the ""family dramas"" that have come before it.",positive

A Hologram for the King,"A good film about being 60, being alone, being abroad and being open-minded.Tom Hanks is a troubled man sent to KSA to sell something on behalf of a big American Corporate. And there he clashes with Arabic Culture in his usual thoughtful and suspended-judgment way.I won't tell you what happens, of course, but after a quick look to the other reviews (someone even claims to have fallen asleep) I understood that not everyone have liked it. And I'm surprised but I won't comment. I would just say, for those who could possibly share my feelings, that this was a good film: interesting, clever and not slow at all. Just, maybe, a little different. Images are great and the story depicts nicely our difficult times. Besides: is there a such thing as a bad Tom Hanks' film?",positive
Maudie,"There is quote by Kurt Vonnegut that comes to mind when I think of Maudie, the latest film based on the real life and times of an artist. ""Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possibly can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something."" That may sound like a backhanded compliment but if Maud Lewis was portrayed accurately in the film, I doubt she'll mind. To her painting wasn't a source of ego or pride. It was something she just did - to make herself happy - and if it made others happy all the better.The film picks up with Maudie, played with understated sensitivity by Sally Hawkins, as she struggles and fails to earn the respect of her family. Despite her severe arthritis, Maudie answers an advert for a live-in maid and runs away. She moves in with and eventually marries the crotchety Everett Lewis (Hawke), a fishmonger who manages to put on a grim smile but once over the film's 40+ year time span. After a time living in Everett's dimly lit squalor, Maudie relights her passion for painting using abandoned cork board and the walls of her new home to paint continuously.The true-life Maudie was eventually considered Canada's most popular and prolific folk artist; though one could hardly tell given the solitude that follows Maudie throughout her life. In the film, she remains isolated, largely due to her debilitating arthritis and painful shyness around strangers. There's one awkward scene early on where Maud struggles to shuffle out of a doorway and stick her head out long enough to compliment a woman's shoes. In that moment we realize her deep desire to be both accepted and left alone.The film aptly compliment's the artist's own frailties and unconventionality with a strikingly brittle and unconventional love story. Maud's warmth towards Everett is sincere and unconditional. She sees in him, a beautiful person - an outcast like her who has been made wild by the cruelties of life but nevertheless deserves her love. As open as Maudie is to the inner-beauties of a warm sunset, Everett remains as cold and brutal as a winter storm. Yet every time he ""puts a foot down,"" he wordlessly capitulates. He grumbles and erupts in objectively despicable behavior but Maud always seems to convince him that he's capable of love and being loved.The film continues down this path of bittersweet co-dependence and as the relationship develops, we see the results of Maud's patience and virtue. Thanks to the remarkably assured cinematography of Guy Godfree, the film crackles with natural beauty and warmth of a cozy hearth. There are some truly breathtaking natural vistas on display here, which despite their expanse manage to feel intimate and idyllic.As a film Maudie is certainly within the ranks of Mr. Turner (2014), My Left Foot (1989) and Lust for Life (1956). Much like those films, Maudie centers on the life of a tortured artist whose personal story tells something truly meaningful about the human condition. It also has a truly award-worthy performance by Sally Hawkins who is at this point in a class of her own.",negative
Maudie,"When you are compelled to write a review, and you realise this is your first ever review of a film, you then understand the impact that a true classic has.Sally Hawkins, Ethan Hawke, well done! If you want to sit down to a less than fast, but utterly embracing film about life's journey, and how individuals are valued, how they react to outside pressures and put their whole world at risk, then this is the film for you .Simply.. Brilliant.",positive
Laggies,"We are talking a script that is not merely bad, but bad on a level of magnitude which makes other bad scripts look like Oscar material.There are too many examples to list here. But let us just say that the scene where Sam Rockwell suddenly and out of nowhere declares his love for Knightly -- after barely getting to know her from a few conversations while she is staying over with his teenage daughter, a declaration of love uttered while he is acting as her lawyer in a police station trying to deal with drunk driving charges -- rings as true as a statement from the Federal Reserve as to why the problems in the economy are not THEIR fault.Once you factor in the bad script, you realize it becomes hard if not impossible for any of the actors to rise to the occasion. It is like hobbling a race horse and then expecting it to show or place.That said, Knightly tries but never, not once, connects with her character. CSM rides to the finish on charm alone and I believe one day the right role will arrive for her and she will go A-List. Rockwell puts in the closest thing to a credible performance.And the turtle unburdened by dialog also does a nice job,",negative
Laggies,There is a winning quality to this romantic comedy about a girl in her 20s (Knightley) in a bit of a mid 20s crisis after being proposed to by her boyfriend. She befriends a teenage girl (Moretz) and her divorced father (Rockwell). It starts off a bit slow but then you realize gradually the characters are all quite likable even when they are doing something wrong. This understated treatment of the more serious moments makes it more effective especially the visit to the mother (Mol). Avoids melodrama which would have spoilt the tone of the movie.Keira Knightley makes her 20s finding herself girl surprisingly sympathetic and identifiable. Throughout her mistakes you still root for her. Chloe Grace Moretz is a standout as always. She gives a sensitive performance and doesn't overact. Amidst all the recent movies a likable teenager character on film is kind of rare. Sam Rockwell plays the father quite charmingly.Overall one the better indie rom coms of late and worth a watch.,positive
Queen of the Desert,"This film was an attractive costume drama which would not have been out of place on Masterpiece Theater, but anyone familiar with Gertrude Bell's achievements and who has read the book 'Desert Queen', will be disappointed at how much was left out. Yes, she was born to a wealthy family, had a brilliant mind, earned a first class degree at Oxford - even attending Oxford was a rarity for a woman at that time. She mixed in the best society being very well connected socially, and also enjoyed the company of many intellectuals of the day. Yes, she fell in love with Henry Cadogan and mourned his death for seven years. She had been prevented from marrying him by her overly possessive parents on some very flimsy grounds - he was a gambler and had no fortune, when they could have easily set up a trust fund for her which he could not touch. Her parents apparently even opened her mail to ensure that she was not being led astray. Her dutiful devotion and love for her parents may have caused her later infatuations and unrequited love for the wrong men. Her friendship with the married Doughty Wiley was shown, as was her iffy working relationship with T. E. Lawrence who supported her while being quite catty behind her back, but her later unrequited love for Henry Fitzsimmons, who used her but refused flat out to marry her, was not. Nor was her long and very close friendship with King Faisal of Iraq, which began when he was Prince and whom she had been instrumental in supporting on the throne. As Faisal's wife and family remained in Mecca and Gertrude became his close adviser, many suspected that they were lovers.Her years of round the world tours to get over Henry's death were left out. Eventually she began her journeys through the middle east and gained the knowledge which put her in the center of things in WWI as a source of information about the Arab tribes, and supporter and close adviser to King Faisal. She was present at the Paris Peace Conference when the winners, desperate to get their hands on the oil, divided up the middle east between them, largely reneging on the promises to allow the Arabs their own kingdom and instead installing puppet kingdoms under British and French mandates.The film ended with a very brief meeting with Faisal and his brother Abdullah, and an epilogue about the creation of Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia where Gertrude Bell had helped define the borders and choose the rulers. But there was much more to the story. After the heady success of helping to create the modern middle eastern kingdoms, being appointed Oriental Secretary awarded the CBE, and being Faisal's right hand woman, called upon every day not only for advice, but companionship, games, tennis, Gertrude found herself becoming less and less important as her task had ended. It probably did not help that she was a woman and had trodden on quite a few toes on the way up. Men would have felt threatened by her and wives would have been jealous. She concentrated her efforts on her writing and establishing the Baghdad Museum, but her life had become empty and no doubt she felt unwanted and useless. Faisal saw less of her and spent more time in Europe 'taking the cures'. Her family fortune disappeared in the post war changing times and she was reduced to living alone if not in poverty, but 'straightened circumstances'. In 1926 she died of an overdose of sleeping pills, which was ruled an accident.Other than leaving half the story out, the other serious flaw was the miscasting of Faisal and Abdullah and their very brief appearance at the close of the film. The two actors should have switched parts. Abdullah, the great grandson of today's King of Jordan, was short and round faced, Faisal was tall, thin, charismatic and extremely handsome. His leadership of the Arab revolt was the reason for the allied win over the Turks. From the film one would think she had only met with Faisal for one minute. Showing more of her relationship with Faisal would have perked up the film enormously. Overall, this topic should have been a Masterpiece Theater miniseries running for at least six hours.",negative
Queen of the Desert,"A film worth seeing, explains the birth of present middle east. A visionary feast and both Nicole Kidman and James Franco's acting is superb.Most critics didn't give it a thumbs up but for me it was a beautiful film, maybe because the lead was a woman who changed the course of history! For anyone who doesn't know anything about the middle east should see it just for history and Gertrude Bells significance in history.... The photography is exhilarating and get to see the desert and the oasis in their beauty. The movie might lack historical details but it focuses on Gertrude Bells life, so that is understandable. But at least for people who never knew what or how the middles east came about and what she did it is an eye opener. A must see file for me!",positive
Slow West,"I'm a huge fan of the Western genre. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is one of my all time favorite films and I'm always on the lookout for a modern western that can kick-start the genre. I was hoping this would be the film but unfortunately I don't think most people will find it appealing. The acting is top notch, especially from Fassbender and Mendelsohn, but ultimately the pace and the melancholic ending will leave most people wanting more. If you liked the look and feel of The Homesman or the slow burn of Meek's Cutoff check this film out. If your looking for an action western with a Hollywood ending then this is a film you should skip.",negative
Slow West,"This is my first review, I wanted to save it for a movie that I was touched by and one that gave me something I didn't expect, in essence a film that gave me everything that I thought it wouldn't. Slow West magnificently portrays the human condition, with all it's defects and strengths. It rather wonderfully and in a very subtle way exposes it's capacity for love and betrayal, loyalty and mistrust, fear and courage. It reveals to us that desperate good people do terrible things to survive in hard times, how hard bitten and essentially broken souls have the means and wherewithal to do good and be forgiving. It shows how we can be innocent and naive and yet still be able to teach, how we can be overly aggressive and yet protective, greedy yet also so very giving. The true wonder of this film is to me is that it exposes to us that all of us can be all of the above at some point in our lives, that we all have the capacity for evil or good and sometimes it is only circumstance that turns us either onto or away from a particular path. It's theme to me is the delicate balance between success and death in the American west during that period from the standpoint of choices made, and to my mind I think it succeeds in portraying this exceptionally well.Many of the reviews I have read on here in regards to this film say it is far too slow, I don't think it is at all, it is a journey, a gradual layering of the story building to a climax, it is not supposed to be action and bells and whistles from the off, I think it is a film that ultimately is trying to make you think; you are invited to explore who we are and what we are capable of as humans in hostile conditions. The performances are excellent all round, the thoroughly underrated Ben Medelsohn particularly as the 'realist' outlaw and Michael Fassbender who commands the screen in all his scenes, as he so often does. I think the writing of the dialogue is fantastic and nuanced, the humour dry and cleverly interspersed and the attention to period detail almost faultless. My only gripe is that there are a couple of scenes that don't seem to fit the narrative, maybe that is what slows this film down for some.I understand that that this kind of western or period drama for that matter is not to everyones taste, that for many 'action' is the byword by which these films stand or fall, well to that I say to each their own. If however you are keen to watch a movie that attempts to reflect back to you just what it means to be a person with all a persons flaws, and how circumstance can shape us into the judged or judgemental, then this very well may be a worthwhile watch for you.",positive
They Came Together,"I am a huge fan of comedy and satire and I'm even okay with the occasional absence of plot for the sake of laughs... Cheap laughs. The type of film that may be void of intellect but still provides entertainment and gets me laughing. But this movie has foregone the plot for the sake of nothing. The comedy found here isn't even good enough to be labeled juvenile or sophomoric. It is down-right stupid. I was not entertained. I was disappointed. Especially since several of the cast members are people whose movies and shows I have enjoyed on numerous occasions. I thought I might find something comparable in this film. Boy, was I wrong. In fact, I hated seeing these people in such a low-level production. The writing is horrid, and yes, that is taking into account the fact that it is ""supposed to be cheesy"" as the movie's intro explains. It just failed to do so in a way that worked and so it fell flat. Very, very flat. I do not recommend this film.",negative
They Came Together,"They Came Together is the first great film satire in years. It skewers everyone, from the most renowned romantic comedies to the most idiotic chick flicks. Paul Rudd and Amy Poehler are perfect, parodying the roles they could very conceivably be cast in (and I believe Paul Rudd has done a few times). Not every joke lands, and most of them go by so quickly it could all be a 30 Rock cutaway, but nevertheless this movie is a delight for anyone who has noticed how brainless and predictable most romantic comedies end up being. Cheers to everyone involved in this movie, and to everyone who gets the joke. Watch it; I hope you find yourself laughing as hard as I did (all three times I watched it).",positive
Love & Friendship,"I can't agree with the enthusiastic reviews of this film nor wholly agree with those that absolutely hate it. Put me right in the middle. The film captured my attention well enough but was ultimately unsatisfying.First of all, Chloe Sevigny seems out of place and while supplying the ""Friendship"" part of the title, has little to do except be a sounding board for Lady Susan. And Stephen Fry is WOEFULLY underutilized.Second of all, watching the film through the Austen lens will be disappointing (perhaps the Stillman lens works better). There are certainly funny bits (James Fleet reading a letter, Tom Bennett's idiocy, and Lady Susan's clever rationales for abhorrent behavior) but these are Stillman funny not Austen funny. And a Brit who doesn't know what peas are!? Yes, the scene is definitely hilarious but nonsensical.Finally, it's a superficial film. Even the poorest adaptations of Austen's significant works can't help but have some gravitas simply due to the ideas present in the novels. The source material here is weak (and Stillman doesn't seem to have added much heft to it). Having read the novella, I can assure you that, while having some clever lines, it is not too memorable. And the film, like the novella, presents few ideas about ""Love"" or ""Friendship."" (In addition, it's an epistolary novella which might explain why so much of the action seems to be reported rather than viewed.)The cast (with the exception of Sevigny) is charming and the film is well-acted. Beckinsale deserves the accolades she is receiving for her performance but ultimately deserves a better film in which to display her talents.",negative
Love & Friendship,"This is one of the few films I have seen where I was left wanting more. There were non stop laughs, funny sight gags and wonderful actors. It was wonderful to see Kate Beckinsale and Chloe Sevigny back together as well. Tom Bennett is truly a joy to watch and steals all of the scenes he is in. The costumes, sets, and acting are all top rate. The script, pacing and direction all make the movie flow at a fast pace. I was never bored and at the end of the film, I was left wanting more. This is one of the greatest compliments I can give to a film. Time does fly when you watch this film and feel free to laugh out loud when you watch it. Everyone else will be.Ten out of ten",positive
6 Years,"This is just a very slow movie, with an ending that you can predict right from the start. The actors are not very convincing and nothing really interesting happens. All the characters do is drink and party, but even that is not fun to watch. The hipster friends/colleagues are just downright annoying to watch, but I guess that makes them realistic.The only positive I can think of is that you could turn this into a drinking game, for every time somebody says ""what the f?!"". That seems to be the only line, and pretty much every character says it all the time. Probably true to life, but a bit boring to watch.",negative
6 Years,"I felt like this story wanted to prove something and that is that women can also be the abusive and aggressive ones in the relationship. Have in mind that I'm a female so there's no way this is biased. I'm actually recognizing that men can be victims of abuse too. It happens. The relationship between Dan and Melanie seems perfect to the outside but has an unhealthy nature. They have arguments in which she pushes and slaps him while he tries to keep her away from him. In one incident, after she pushes him, he falls to the floor and hits his head. The blood stars running so they both go see a doctor. The doctor asks him what happened and he lies, she believes him and let them go after saying something like ""okay, that's all I need to know"". You can clearly see if the situation was the opposite, she would have asked a lot of questions to find out if Melanie had been hit by Dan. A friend of Dan even says so when he tells her what really happened.Then there are more fights in which she seems like the victim but really isn't. He even goes to jail for a whole day just because the police saw them and assumed he was trying to hurt her. There's a moment when the aggressor becomes a victim when she almost gets raped by a random dude.Thinking about it, they are both victims, of themselves. They are so caught up in that twisted ""love"" they feel that they can't seem to function when they are on their own. That's why she forgives his infidelities and he forgives her aggressions. That's not love that's obsession and lack of self-esteem.",positive
Step Up All In,"One of these days Step Up will realize that it's better for the characters to just whimsically dance like in old musical movie without forcing an already stagnant plot. The movie boasts a dynamic choreography and stellar music to go with it, some are timed just right and they are admittedly entertaining. It commendably tries to bring a dancer's perspective on their life style and tribulation, but the plot often contradicts the effort by putting overly flamboyant characters or tired plot. In the end it's just another drawn out excuse for a dance battle, albeit a rather spectacular one.Story revolves around characters from previous installments, collaborating to make a crew to win the high stake dance competition. No Channing Tatum though. If this sounds familiar, it is. There are monetary issues, personal issues and dances in between. For what it's worth, the two leads try to bring more emotion to the mix, although only a few good moments come out of it. Adam Sevani (Moose) is a star, the uncrowned lead of the series. It's quiet amazing that his side story resonates more than the actual main plot.Problem arises when the movie attempts to exaggerate flamboyant lifestyle, especially those of celebrity's and their reality television. It's far from witty; in fact the humor tends to fall and becomes tiresome to watch. The main antagonists are mediocre unsavory characters; the male is copied directly from the typical random thug that messes with Chuck Norris or Steven Seagal at a bar, while the female is a botched version of Stanley Tucci's character from Hunger Games.When the characters don't banter they perform well. Using odd props and good dance moves, they manage to produce a spectacle. Most of the cast are primarily dancers, so they convince the audience better using motion than poorly written script. Wardrobe looks good, each dance is represented with unique costume, the steampunk one is particularly exceptional. With simple yet effective effect, these dance sequences are the heights of the movie.Like any other installments, the plot is almost a hindrance as audience waits for another dance scene to erupt. It does try to make audience relate, although it misses the mark more often than not, which is a shame since it invests plenty of time for it. The glossy choreograph and heart-thumping soundtracks present an enjoyable light flick, and to be fair it's what viewer would expect, but sadly nothing more.",negative

J'ai perdu mon corps,"Ok, so I'll get to the point. This movie has a walking hand going to his ""owner"" during basically the whole movie. The only reason I ave it a two it's bceause the animation is well made, but the plot? WTH was that plot?
Summarized, a kid who wanted to be a pianist and an astronaut has a car accident with his parent, which them both die. Then we fast forward to his audlthoof, ina non-loving family (or we assume, everything is shown fast forward with no further explanation). So, he's a failure in life, he is a pizza delivery guy who is always late. By now you must be wondering ""ok, so this is Peter Parker"", well, almost, except he never gets bitten by a spider. He falls in love with a woman by having an exchange via intercom (he failed to deliver her pizza ontime) so, the movie becomes this guy trying to find this girl and eventually working in her....father's? wood shop. There a litttle romance here and there, then he confesses the girl he followed her since the day of the delivery, and took the job to be close to her. He goes away (obviusly) and then, in a sequence that is bordering the ridiculos, he cuts his hand
Soooo, you would think that the journey of the hand would have a trascendental meaning to find him....no, in the last 10 minutes, the hand help the girl find the main character (apparently she forgave him?) only to find he jumped to...a working station in a building...and he's not even there....roll the credits (srsly that's hhow the final scene goes)
I was left scratching my head after what I saw and I find this movie has almost an 8?....Nuh-huh, I support amateur movies or movies that try to go away from the cliche, but this movie. Didn't wanted to be cliche, and ended up being a bunch of nonsense....and cliche...",negative

Rings,"Seven days! A simple phrase that struck terror in our hearts oh so many years ago. Certainly, you know I'm talking of The Ring, the horror movie about a death delivering video tape certain to scare you to death. Samara's tale has fallen on to the backburner for some time, but like the cursed video, the series has resurfaced to the modern world to once more have you cowering at your screens. Will Rings live up to the potential? Robbie K here, once more sharing his opinions on yet another film. Let's get started. LIKES:  Decent acting  Nice blend into the modern era  Strong story for a horrorSummary: Okay, this movie is certainly not going to win awards for best performance, but Rings' cast has some skill in their performances of college kids plagued by an evil spirit. Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz and Alex Roe are the leads of this tale, doing a great job of balancing romance and detective work, finally a power couple who wasn't annoying. And Johnny Galecki trades one nerd role for another, though this time his scientific qualities had a little darker twist to the mix. Overall, the cast gets a pat on the back for establishing some good characters to hook on to. Yet the major things this reviewer liked involved the story components of the movie. Rings has jumped into the modern area, dropping the outdated VHS tapes for modern day MP4 files. It will help bridge the generation gaps, and add a new element that the other installments were missing. And the story was much stronger than I anticipated. Rings has more mystery to it, trying to find the answers to the elusive mystery of Samara's origins. Where it fits in the grand scheme of things is a little up in the air, but at least there is some character development and drama to spice things up. And as for the ending, it too is a little ambiguous, providing some delightfully dark closure, but still leaving it open for future installments. Not the strongest finish, but also not bad. DISLIKES:  Scare Factor at A Low  Some plot elements lackluster  Not the same RingSummary: Rings story may be on target, but the scare factor still didn't reach the same levels that the first movie was able to achieve. This installment resorted to jump out scare moments, mainly trying to make you jump with sudden loud noises and hallucinations appearing from out of nowhere. Many of these moments weren't well timed, and to be honest many of the objects just weren't scary. Think of the first film and how creepy everything was, the unknown always teasing you until something sprung out of nowhere. All that was very diluted in this installment. Even though they finally show you how she kills her victims, the team didn't quite make it as horrifying as I thought it would be (think ghost rider's soul stare without the flashy fire). Rings was lacking this element, and had more of a mystery theme to it than an actual horror. In addition, there were also some plot elements that didn't shine as much as they wanted. For this reviewer, there is still some questions they still haven't fully answered that you have to draw yourself. The bottom line of the dislikes is that Rings didn't quite hit the same level the first movie had all those years ago. The VERDICT:In conclusion, Ring is not so much a horror movie in this round, but a mystery film about uncovering the origins of Samara. While the cast is decent, the story is mostly thought out, and we have some answer, it still didn't feel like the Ring series we've come to know. If you are looking for a movie to scare the pants off of you, sorry this isn't the film to do it. And you can probably guess, but yours truly doesn't recommend this one for the theater and implores you to wait until it hits home rental stands. Only people who might enjoy this one in theater are those who care about the story element of the movie, but I still think you can wait for home (I mean we have been waiting twelve years for this one right?). My scores are:Drama/Horror: 6.5 Movie Overall: 5.0",negative
Rings,"Sometimes regardless of view, a film is just a bad film, regardless of actors, script and production. This is one such film, it is a bad film, it scores points for the terrific opening on the plane, it's no wonder that scene was shown as the main trailer, bold, dynamic, truly thrilling. Sadly, after that excellent opening, the film became a virtual mess.The terror once caused by Samara, now had an almost comedic value, at one stage it felt as though an attempt was made to give her an almost cuddly likeability, it was pitched incredibly badly.It lacked any real scares, the original was disturbing to the point that many didn't want to watch the actual video, as a horror it was terrific, this was a horror non entity.The acting was decent, though they were up against a terrible script.After a great opening, this dies a slow death. 3/10",positive
The Duke of Burgundy,"BERBERIAN SOUND STUDIO, is centred on a British sound engineer Gilderoy (Jones), who previously works on projects such as pastoral documents, arrives in Italy to work in a new project from Italian director Giancarlo Santini (Mancino) in the titular studio, which he has no idea is a spooky giallo about witches, anyway he stays and engages in working with the obnoxious producer Francesco (Fusco), but due to the barrier of language and the rude behaviour received from his new colleagues, Gilderoy is incapable of blending in with the team and begins to question his professional competence, hallucinations and dreamlike sequences ensue, what is the real deal to bring him to the studio? Is he one of the characters in the giallo flick or an unwitting guinea pig of a bigger but secret project?Everything will end in a befuddling concussion and here is my main gripe, it is a 93-minutes film, stuffed with minute details towards the omnipresence of sound (both lifeless objects and human voice including screaming and post-dub process), and striking shots of various apparatus and items (mainly vegetables) used to create specific sound in a claustrophobic working environment, lumbers drearily until the last 15 minutes or so (the most banal part is the stereotyped depiction of the Italian crew), the storyline finally begins to project an uncanny angle which piques curiosity, but as if Strickland doesn't have a clear train-of- thought of what has happened, the picture comes to a halt abruptly, provokes the frustration due to one's unquenched satisfaction mixed with a sense of deception, obviously something rotten is festering (other than the vegetables), but there are so little clues being offered for us to conjecture a plausible upshot. Fortuitously, this bitter taste will be massively dispelled in Strickland's latest project, THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY, a lesbian drama set in an ethereal world with no men in sight (yes, no dukes or whatsoever, even a mannequin sitting among the audience during the academic symposium is female). Cynthia (Knudsen) is a lepidopterologist (a branch of entomology concerning the study of moths and butterflies), actually the film's title refers to a particular species of butterfly in UK. She lives in a quaint and baroque villa in an anonymous rural area with her younger lover Evelyn (D'Anna), probably her disciple.Due to Strickland's ingenious trickery, initially audience is ushered to a scenario of a two- play between Cynthia, a harsh mistress and her subservient maid Evelyn, the latter will be punished if she doesn't meet the former's strict demand. Later their real identity lays bare that the two are actual lovers, their double-imaged sex scenes embroider a layer of mystery into their devoted passion, and more shockingly, the punishment is implied to be urolagnia, which immediately explains why Cynthia is persistently shown drinking water before their role-play. So it is about BDSM, a lesbian variant of 50 SHADES OF GREY (2015)? Believe me, it's much better! The role definition is another twist here, the apparently dominant Cynthia, is really the passive one, all her act is wholesomely scripted by Evelyn in advance, who can only satisfy her libido by being put under some sort of punishment/humiliation, she dictates which line Cynthia should deliver, at what precise moment, which costume and wig she should wear during the occasion. Nevertheless, after the repetitious act, Cynthia grows tired of the game, and mainly because she doesn't enjoy it sexually, and meanwhile Evelyn becomes more and more difficult to be satisfied, since commitment is the key in role- playing, once Cynthia has a slip of mind in her role, a small chasm will inevitably engenders. After a futile effort to purchase a tailor-made bed or a human toilet (I cannot even imagine what it is), Evelyn's request escalates to be locked up in an antique chest with hands tied up for the night as a punishment she enjoys, their relationship is under severe strain, until a corny set piece of betrayal opportunely emerges (by cleaning other woman's boots).Meritoriously Strickland doesn't resort to hyperbole, he sticks to the eerie atmosphere, picturesque location, tonal device, to decipher Cynthia's incubus and Evelyn's controlling nature, butterflies and specimens are deployed with staggering beauty and the finale, a rotation to the beginning, is a hymn celebrating the delicate equilibrium between two lovers, love demands sacrifice, both parties can take one step back and strive to re-connect from the very start, that is a profound meditation on the nature of love, however cinematically contrived the story is, this end-note remarkably hits the bull's eye.Both films feature strong leading performances, Toby Jones in BSS, is an outsider awkwardly boxed up in a bizarrely sonic space, helplessly struggles to get a grip with his own sense while forcibly keeping the appearance of sobriety, and his stern look during a prolonged close-up is a defiant testimony of the perseverance from an unattractive character thespian, if the camera lingers on him longer, he can be an attention-grabber too.Danish actress Sidse Babett Knudsen, mostly known for Susanne Bier's Oscar-nominated foreign picture AFTER THE WEDDING (2006, 7/10) expresses in fluent English and lights up the screen with a sympathetic presentation of a woman plagued by her lover's gruelling quest to challenge the limbo of human lust. Italian actress Chiara D'Anna, also appears in BSS, not a knockout at first sight, but grows on you with her seductive manner of speaking and unyielding determination to delve into the darkest side of her sexual thrill. All in all, TDOB is a deliriously lurid fable with a swooning flagrancy, without a doubt Strickland's best work to date.",negative
The Duke of Burgundy,"Forget 9 1/2 Weeks, forget Last Tango in Paris, forget Secretary and most definitely forget 50 Shades, this is THE definitive cinematic essay on a dom/sub relationship.The idea is a fascinating and brave one: to create an homage to artistic elements of the ""disreputable"" sexploitation movies of the 1970s and make it beautiful and profound. It's another movie that full of references to other movies and to the movie-making process. I recognised only little hints of Just Jaekin, being unfamiliar with the other influences. I did spot the marker tape on the carpet that serve two purposes, practical and metaphorical. Er.. three, there are two metaphors going on, I think, one plot-related and one post- modern commentary.Talking of plot, it is so slight that it could be explained in three sentences. I won't, obviously, but honestly it wouldn't matter if I did. What matters is the manner of the telling.The story inhabits a strange dream-like space where everyone in the town is a fetishistic female entomologist! (If anyone can explain the significance of the entomology, please do, I'm all ears!) But within the unreal external world, the two heroines inhabit an emotional world that is utterly believable.In sumptuous but slightly muted autumn colours, the film looks gorgeous. I found it sensual, very erotic (despite there being no more than a few seconds of anything you could call ""sex"" and no nudity at all), emotionally engaging, warm, sad, funny and REAL.Although the story deals exclusively with dominance and submission (no trace of S&M despite what it says in all the publicity, including in interviews with the director) it is a universal story about conflicting desires, fantasies, trust and compromise. In some way, it is a story for every relationship.I absolutely loved this film.",positive
Koto no ha no niwa,"Within the first few seconds, you know you're in for a treat for your eyes. The animation in this movie so well done and pleasing to watch. It's one of the better animations I've seen, at least when it comes to the environment (the people are animated pretty much just like most other anime movies). There are so many details and work put into this.We meet the boy Takao quickly through his narration. It's both beautiful to listen to and at the same time kind of funny, since he is only 15 and he makes it sound like an angsty diary entry. He like the rain, and shoes. He skips school to go to the park when it rains, where he meets a woman. They seem to have the same idea of going to the park on rainy days. He finds out eventually that he wants to design shoes for her.The movie is unintentionally funny in its fixation in shoes and feet. In one way, it almost framed in a fetishized way, on the other hand, its very sweet and beautiful to watch.The movie is very short, so there is not much time for character development or to let the story unravel in a slow pace. I don't know myself why Shinkai didn't make it longer (time or money or both probably), but if he could've made it longer, he should have. It has lots of promise, and would be way more interesting if it could tackle their relationship more, especially based on the massive taboo on age difference in Japan. It misses out on some really good opportunities for telling a deeper story.There's a climax where there is a lot of feelings and crying going on and it is, unfortunately, bombarded with really loud emotional music. The dialogue is intense and almost violent, and at the same time kind of silly in a strange way. The music almost drowns out the dialogue and there is anger and sadness and love and it all happens so fast and in an intense way it's hard to know what to feel.I really wanted to like this movie more than I did. It has a lot of potential, the animation, again, is gorgeous, the story is cute, but with not much substance (of course it has some, it tackles some issues of the woman, Yukari, for example, but not deeply enough. Everything is told so fast you'll almost miss it). I do want to see more of Shinkai (this is the first one I see), because I have no doubt he has made things better than this, and I look forward to see it.",negative
Koto no ha no niwa,"I have no words that can describe how in love I am with this movie. I stumbled upon it randomly, thought the art looked lovely, and decided to give it a view. I'm so glad I did. The artwork and animation is just breathtaking. The landscapes and city scenes are almost photo realistic, attention being given to the tiniest of details. I would consider it on par with Studio Ghibli at least. I consider myself very critical when it comes to animations, and it takes a lot to really wow me, but this took the cake. I came with no expectations, and left wondering why this movie isn't more widespread and the need to tell everyone I know to watch it. Though the film is only 46 minutes long, it feels like a feature length film. I was captivated for every second of it, and will be watching it many times in the future.Too long, didn't read? Watch this movie.",positive
La belle et la bête,"There have been many versions of the classic fairytale of Beauty And The Beast - from operas and television shows to science-fiction re- tellings. The best-known incarnation of the story, of course, bears the Disney brand and features singing teapots and dancing candlesticks. It sounds ridiculous, sure, but anyone who's watched that film will know that it packs a genuine emotional punch. That's not something that can be said of this latest effort by writer- director Christophe Gans, an opulent, lavishly CGI-ed affair that hews closer to the original, darker story (at least at the beginning) but seems to have forgotten the heart of its tale along the way.The film opens on an elderly merchant (André Dussollier), who has raised a brood of narcissistic, spoilt children - apart from thoughtful, sensitive Belle (Léa Seydoux). As his fortune crumbles around him, the merchant stumbles into an enchanted castle, wherein he helps himself to plenty of food and treasures. The price exacted by the Beast (Vincent Cassel), mysterious owner of the castle, is a steep one: the merchant's freedom. When Belle arrives in place of her father, she finds herself both prisoner and guest - she's given beautiful gowns to wear and the run of the entire castle, but must spend every evening having dinner with the prickly and recalcitrant Beast. When the Beast finally allows Belle to see her family again, she inadvertently opens the way to the castle for people bearing prejudice, greed and, quite possibly, disaster.There's no denying that Gans' film looks good - Belle is draped in rich, velvety fabrics, ivory-hued statues lie wreathed in ivy and tears, and the castle stands starkly Gothic against lowering skies. Cassel's Beast make-up - which makes him look like a cross between a cat and a wolf - is decent enough, though it doesn't give him much room to emote. There are moments when the film and its ideas seem to flare to life too. When Belle dreams of the people who lived and loved in the castle before her, she becomes witness to a climactic scene in which a horrible curse is cast - a girl lies, dying and naked, on the ground, cradled in the arms of her broken prince, bleeding a gleaming, scarlet trail of blood. It's a stirring image that might give viewers hope that the rest of the film can be as good and as daring.But Beauty And The Beast seldom reaches those same heights. In busying himself populating the entire universe of his film with greedy vagabonds and comic-relief sisters, Gans forgets to enrich and develop the central relationship between Belle and her Beast. They share a few stilted, frankly terrifying dinners in which the Beast loses his temper or creepily breathes down Belle's neck. Slinking into her room to watch as she sleeps, the Beast comes across more as her pervert jailer than a legitimate romantic interest. In fact, none of their encounters suggests that Belle could ever find a place for him in her heart, so it's odd when Gans takes it as a given and barrels on towards his literally gigantic, CGI-overloaded ending.Indeed, Gans spends so much time on the visual effects of his film - from the droopy-eyed puppy-like creatures that trail after Belle wherever she goes, through to the huge stone statues that come to life to defend the Beast - that he seems to have forgotten to get his actors to act. Cassel and Seydoux, who have both delivered arresting performances in other films, don't seem hugely invested in the proceedings or in each other. The film as a whole isn't helped, either, by the dreadful dubbed version playing in Singapore - moments that might have felt more organic and engaging in the original French feel stilted and almost ridiculous when recited in either monotonous or heavily-accented English.Sometimes, it's easier to understand when directors lose sight of their characters in the flash and tumult of an action blockbuster - the focus, after all, is on spectacle rather than heart. It's less forgivable when the point of the entire story is the relationship between the two title characters. Without careful, gentle treatment, this centuries-old tale of Beauty and her Beast would have some pretty nasty overtones - which Gans fails to really remove from his film. In effect, his version of Beauty And The Beast is a love story without much love - and, as a result, isn't much of a story either.",negative
La belle et la bête,"When looking at movies I happened upon this one out of curiosity, and I am all the better for it. First, clear your mind of the Disney releases and story lines behind them. On many layers this masterful work will enchant you, from beginning to end. Disney should be put on notice, because the makers of this film made Disney look like amateurs. The sets, and costuming epitomize the true essence of what movie magic is all about, and will not disappoint you. Even the ending was wonderfully magical. The film score is awesome. Vincent Cassel, Léa Seydoux, André Dussollier all should be recognized for their fantastic talents. The makers of this film have something to be truly proud of. This is a lavishly and visually stunning film, completely delightful, and worth watching a few more times to see what you may miss. The details are exquisite to behold. I can with certainty recommend this film to anyone, knowing they will agree.",positive
The Longest Week,"This film tells the story of a man with ultra rich parents, who is suddenly broke after his parents cut off his allowance. He puts on a cover up and wins a woman's heart, yet he discovers there is something more to life.The interaction between Conrad and Dylan is realistic, thigh they both live in a world beyond most people's reach. Their intense competition between each other and yet almost accomplishing nothing is ironic, but I like the joke about the Volvo going back and forth. The romance subplot is very sweet and convincing, I enjoyed watching it.This is a romantic comedy with a journey of self discovery. It's a pity that the main characters Conrad and Dylan are portrayed to be rather unlikable and arrogant characters who have no clue about the real world. That's because the film is actually enjoyable and rather warm, and if the characters are a bit more likable, people would probably like it more.",negative
The Longest Week,"The first thought that came to my mind watching this charming comedy was- this is a witty homage to the great Claude Lelouch and his 1966 classic "" A Man and a Woman"" (""Un homme et une femme"" original title).Jay Israelson's music is simply beautiful. The repetitive critics on several portals of how this is a copy of Wes Anderson or Woody Allen, are incredibly narrow minded and surprisingly coming from big name news sources. Also, Django Reinhardt is fabulous on any occasion and does not need to be reduced to just association with specific filmmakers even if they are as brilliant as Mr. Allen. Those thoughts didn't even get to compete with the homage notion. Loved the writing and directing of Peter Glanz.Jason Bateman is just incredibly amusing in his quaint portrayal of Conrad Valmont, detached trust fund kid - man, or Billy Crudup's ever eccentric ways, both in dead on performances. All of the cast is just wonderful. Usually, the constant narration can be annoying, but in this case it is marvelously delivered by Mr. Bateman, in his unique matter of fact way. I highly recommend this movie.",positive
Man Up,"Some very strange things happen in Man Up, Ben Palmer's surprisingly likable romantic comedy, starring Simon Pegg and Lake Bell. the real star here is the American actress (and sometime director) Lake Bell – an established pro at accents and who steals the show with her rubbery, expressive face and penchant for self-humiliation. Ignore the sieve-like plot, though, because the script is largely excellent, Pegg and Bell sizzle on screen together trading flirty one-liners and bitchy ripostes like well-timed highfives. With its action condensed into a single afternoon and evening, Man Up expertly conveys the feel of one of those great first dates that just kept going, it's got an endearing and awkward Britishness that makes its characters relatable and in the shape of its gifted leads an on screen couple you'll genuinely root for. Man Up has enough breezy pleasures to make it worthy of recommendationMy VoTe--7/10",negative
Man Up,"It's not a perfect comedy by all means. But it has a lot of heart. And it's not only in the outtakes that it can be seen, that the actors had a lot of fun in this. You do sometimes wonder how they could have stayed with a straight face, with the things they do or say to each other. Still this is not only funny and uplifting, it has two very charismatic and talented people at the front.This may not be enough for some comedies, but with a solid script like this one has, the movie did Man Up and deliver on its premise. It does have flaws as I already mentioned, like the inciting incident, you have to buy it, to enjoy the rest. But if you get over that, you will have fun with it - literally",positive
The Hollars,"""The Hollars"" is one of those movies that has a mixture of laughs, drama, and sorrow and sadness still it entertains with love and memories showing that life always is a change with the new. John(John Krasinski)is a man who returns to his small Ohio town to visit his dying mother Sally Hollar(the wonderful Margo Martindale)who's very ill with a terminal case of brain cancer. By her side is her loving husband of many years Don(Richard Jenkins)and it's a tailspin for John he's got a lot on his plate including a pregnant wife in Rebecca(Anna Kendrick)and he meets an old flame of his while in town and she's still interested even though married too, and John doesn't want to move back! Clearly this film is clearly a test of love and fate it shows that with time life and fate changes it's all about new starts despite the sorrow and loss of a loved one still memories of love will always be present. Overall ""The Hollars"" is one touching emotional drama of love and change it's one film to sure see.",negative
The Hollars,"This movie literally had the theater laughing and crying throughout the whole movie. There is a serious story line, yet Krasinksi is able to uplift the tone of the movie. There are numerous types of comedy for everyone to enjoy! I have never shed more than a tear during a film, but I found myself crying and sniffling throughout this whole movie. When I wasn't busy crying, I was laughing. The actors did a phenomenal job portraying their characters! So Kudos to everyone involved in the process of making this film. I would definitely recommend to others (although beware there is a very small amount of cussing involved with the dialogue.)",positive

I enjoyed the journey that I darted on with the characters and everything came full circle and was done so incredibly well. The love shared by the two main characters was so deep and pure that I was moved to tears---sobbing, really---multiple times.But it's more than a beautiful love story, it's life in art.

Thelma,"To all the reviewers that gave this 8 9 or 10 out of 10, give yourselves an uppercut. You either had something to do with the production of this film or have never been allowed out of the basement.

Thelma,"Lights flicker, the wind rises and animals behave strangely when Thelma becomes agitated. She is capable of mysterious and ethereal powers, and more than she knows because her manipulative and fundamentalist parents keep such things under wraps in home-school. As Thelma heads to college in Oslo and stops taking medications, not only do her parents lose control, she loses control of herself. Psychogenic seizures rack her body. Passions and anxieties multiply along with her abilities. This is when Anja, Thelma's close friend, does something extremely upsetting for Thelma. The next day when Anja can't be found, Thelma has a sickening feeling she had something to do with it. She searches for answers to the secrets and powers that beguile and haunt her.This thrilling, deep, complex and sensual film explores a whole realm of different theories and possibilities. I was surprised and delighted by its twists and turns. It crosses borders between reality and fantasy, and light and darkness, and explores the good and bad in human nature. The actors are amazing, especially Eili Harboe as Thelma and Kaya Wilkins as Anja. It is fantastic to discover that the roots of psychogenic disorders go back as far as Joan of Arc.

Two Night Stand,"How would you cope if you were trapped with your fleeting hookup, and found yourself deconstructing the encounter? Such is the engagingly modern premise of this movie. It works better than similar previous efforts such as ""No Strings Attached"" or ""Friends with Benefits"" because, a) it's funny, and b) the two characters don't know each other, so it doesn't feel contrived, and gives these people a decent excuse to be brutally honest with one another...This framework suits Teller in particular - he was terrific in ""Whiplash"", but outside of drama he unfortunately projects a conceited kind of air that makes him a difficult presence to warm to. That's not a problem here, as his character in particular is given moments and lines that paint him in an unsympathetic light.The film loses its way somewhat in the final 20 minutes, with the script searching for an unusual and plausible way of bringing the story to a conclusion (it succeeds at the former, but not so much with the latter!) For its first hour, though, this is a frank and funny look at how the different genders approach relationships.",negative
Two Night Stand,"I have to say this, I watched this movie not knowing what to expect. I knew I was looking forward to it as I like Miles Teller as an actor, but other than that I did not know what to expect. This movie was not only awesomely funny, but also had a good, if somewhat predictable storyline, however, the steady stream of humor allowed it to soar beyond its tried and tested storyline. I have never seen a movie where even the sex scenes made me laugh, this one did.The movie did not only have great writing, but the performances of Miles Teller and Annaleigh Tipton were in my opinion highlights of the movie. I would recommend this to anyone who has seen Miles Tellers previous work, anyone that is looking for a romantic comedy that men can enjoy as much or even more than women, and anyone just looking to laugh.",positive

Yi dai zong shi,"Sadly speaking, ""The Grandmaster"" does not get a grand score from me.Before this film, 3 movies have been made about Ip Man, with the first two by Donnie Yen. Like it or not, first movers always have an advantage. The prequel of Ip Man - ""A Legeng is Born - Ip Man"" - did pretty well, featuring a Wing Chun practitioner Dennis To. But, in my opinion, all these 3 movies did not sufficiently capture aspects of the Man's life stories that many fans are looking for - his philosophy about Wing Chun, how he took up Wing Chun, and, of course, his mentor-ship of Bruce Lee.""The Grandmaster"", in my opinion, missed this golden opportunity to satisfy the thirst of martial arts fans on these aspects.For one, I am surprised to see that the script chose to focus on something other than Wing Chun - the so-called ""64 forms"", a kind of martial art - and revolve around the relationship between Man and Gong Er (Zhang Ziyi), with a rather strange majority of screen time placed on Er. In fact, I strongly suspected that the ""Grandmaster"" in the film is actually Gong Er and not Ip Man (and perhaps this film will be so successful in this respect that there will be another film on Gong Er?)I believe audeince is in for the story behind Ip Man, Wing Chun and Bruce Lee, not ""64 forms"" or the fictitious Gong Er. It is clearly focus misplaced.The fighting sequence is a major disappointment as well. Fighting sequence is barely 5 moves in total, with the camera zooming in on to the hands or legs and, which is my pet peeve, the overuse of slow motion and special effects that obscure the real beauty of the moves. I am not sure whether these effects are specially chosen to mask the fact that Tony Leung is not a martial artist, but applying these on veterans such as Zhang Ziyi - who has learn some martial arts before - is a waste of talents.Taking a step back, I suspect that the producers and director seemed to want to break away from the proved formula of story-telling about Ip Man and Wing Chun, and took risk in the script and even cinematography. However, I see traces of Zhang Yimou in the technique, which I neither am opposed to nor strongly encouraged. However, I think the director OVERDID on the special and visual effects, because, in my opinion, he may have wanted every scene and frame to be visually stunning. While there are many scenes (including the special effects) that are indeed very captivating - e.g. those at the train station involving the duel of Gong Er and San - these effects quickly became a major muddling distraction for me, to an extent that I felt like the film has overrun in length in its appeal to audience.I prefer a film that takes care of its basics well, before venturing into the visual/special effects (what I consider icing on the cake). In any story involving Ip Man, the basics should be the man, his family, his time and his Wing Chun.Finally, the film applied another technique often seen in Zhang Yimou's films - the somewhat emotionally derived script with somewhat wooden expressions on its casts, with a hope to create an ambiance of mystery and helplessness (e.g. in a time that saw China fell into the hands of the Japanese during World War II). Personally, this technique is a waste of the acting talents of the likes of Tony Leung and Zhang Ziyi.""The Grandmaster"" is clearly a focus misplaced.I had higher hopes for anything Ip Man and Wing Chun.",negative
Yi dai zong shi,"THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE INTERNATIONAL CUT, NOT THE 'HARVEY WEINSTEIN' American VERSION:It was finally time for the great iconoclastic Hong Kong director to turn to martial arts in his intense and atmospheric telling of the great grandmaster teacher, Ip man, and he doesn't disappoint.Wong Kar-wai brings the poetic beauty of his ""In the Mood for Love"" to this Chinese action genre and executes it with a precise rhythmic heightening reminiscent of Sam Peckinpah at his best, while bringing out the experience of living through the Japanese invasion of China during WWII.The cast is magnificent, especially Tony Leung as the Ip man and Ziyi Zhang as Gong Er who perfectly embodies a kung-fu mistress trying to avenge her father.A Wong masterpiece to put on a level with his finest work!PS: One particular reviewer earlier criticized the editing of this film which, to me, smacks of putting down the film for not being more conventional. Sometimes it is difficult to put aside expectations of what one wants a film to be in favor of what the actual film on the screen is. ""The Grandmaster"" is, in fact, brilliantly edited. Wong is, if nothing else, a perfectionist in taking years to mold his assembled footage into his own personal rhythmic poem, idiosyncratically emphasizing downbeats and rests as precise as a great composer. What you see here is Wong Kar-wai's personal vision, take it or leave it. I wouldn't change a frame, or a single edit.

Third Person,"Writer Michael (Liam Neeson) left his wife Elaine (Kim Basinger) and is living in a hotel having an affair with society reporter Anna (Olivia Wilde) who wants his help to write her novel. Former soap star Julia (Mila Kunis) gets a hotel maid job so that she can get visitation rights to her son with her lawyer Theresa Lowry (Maria Bello) and her ex Richard Weiss (James Franco). In Italy, businessman Scott (Adrien Brody) is getting entangled with illegal Monika (Moran Atias) and her young daughter. The three stories intertwine.Paul Haggis does his interconnected stories again. I like this idea slightly more than Crash. At least, this one isn't trying to preach something obvious. He's not hitting the audience over the head with some kind of social commentary. Neeson and Wilde have a little bit of fun. I find Kunis' character compelling. On the other hand, I hate Brody's story. It starts with the ridiculous bomb scare. The comedy bit about a shoe bomb just makes it so much worse. The hotel clerk discriminating against her is another bad step. A villain would take the money before asking for more. No bad guy would let somebody walk out with the cash. That whole story seems to be a farce. I can't stand Brody's story and the extended running time doesn't help.",negative
Third Person,"I loved the plot and also the actings, and I truly don't understand the low reviews. I mean, of course it is not an easy film to watch, sometimes it fails to keep your attentions because it does develop slowly and most parts you don't get it right away... But it is a great movie, intelligent and with amazing actings. I confess I didn't get all the points right away and had to do a little research afterwards, but when I got it all, the story became even more beautiful. I gathered some of those points I found important to understand to be able to evaluate the movie properly, so if you don't want spoilers DON'T READ BELOW HERE.*******SPOILER ALERT*******1. The writer was NOT in Paris writing his book; he was in Rome. Maybe some people missed this detail (as I did), but when his wife calls him, in the final scene, she asks him, ""How's Rome?"". And also you can clearly see he's sitting in a café in an Italian city. 2. Everything that happens between the starting scene, when he hears his son's voice on the hotel room ""Watch me,"" and the same voice ""Watch me"" in the final scene of the film, is part of his book -- including the story about the writer in Paris with his lover. Probably his mistress name was not Anna, and we can notice that she is fictional by how idealized (at least partially) she is: young, pretty, and with sense of humour, and perfect.* Remember that he always writes in Third Person (not by chance, the name of the movie).** Perhaps Paris did happen, but not during that time space we are watching the movie. Maybe months ago... Note that his wife calls him twice and both times she asks: ""Is she there?"", and he always answers ""No"" -- in the final scene, he still adds ""She left me two months ago"".*** Note the references to white in each story: Anna's dress in the final scene is white, the glass of milk the child gives his father is white, and the car in which the American drives away with the gypsy lady is also white. ""White the color of trust. And the color of the lies he tells himself"" -- says the end of the book.3. As he atones for his sins through the characters from his book, we know what really happened going from there:In real life, he loses his lover when she learns that it was because of her call that his son drowned; in Paris' story, his mistress (""the only true love of his life"") comes back to him.In real life, he loses his son; in Italy's story, the American saves the gypsy lady's daughter (note that inside the car they look back and smile, and as the camera goes away you can see the silhouette of a child in the back seat of the white car).In real life, he never wins back the trust of his ex-wife; in the story with Mila Kunis, James Franco trusts her again after the incident in the elevator. * Also note the references to bad fathers in each story:In Italy, the American also lost his son.In New York, the boy's father is absent and always working, and they do not have a close relationship.In Paris, the father used to abuse of Anna, probably since she was a child.",positive
Behind the Candelabra,"This movie about Liberace's relationship with Thorson is wonderfully acted by Douglas and Damon, effectively filmed, well written, and, for me, not especially enjoyable. I found Damon's powerlessness in the relationship depressing, and while Douglas makes Liberace seem pretty likable, his actions are insufferably egocentric and inconsiderate. Since the book this was based on was written by a jilted lover, it may or may not reflect much truth, but it's still a depressing story.It's hard to know how real any of this is. The plastic surgeon is so disturbing looking that it's hard to believe anyone would go under his knife (the single image I could find of him through google did not look nearly as freakish) and even though Douglas does a great job of nuancing Liberace into a real person in spite of his quirky voice and mannerisms, parts of the movie seem rather cartoonish. It's nice we've reached a point where major Hollywood actors will take a chance on material like this; it's a movie that doesn't shy away from sex the way earlier movies about gay people did. But I just never could get into it.",negative
Behind the Candelabra,"Congrats to HBO for having the guts to produce a script which mainstream studios refused to consider. ""Behind The Candelabra"" gives us a story about Liberace's personal life, from the POV of his one time lover, ""blond Adonis"" Scott Thorson. The plot spans some ten years, from 1977 to Liberace's death in 1987.Aside from his public persona, Liberace (Michael Douglas) comes across as egotistical, daring, self-absorbed, and to some extent old-fashioned in his values and beliefs. Scott Thorson (Matt Damon) comes across as passive, a tad lazy, and lacking in foresight and intellect. The plot's first half presents us with a love story. In the second half, reality sets in. One gets the feeling that though there may have been love between the two, Scott is just one more object for Liberace to collect, which was easy for him given his wealth. That kind of material relationship speaks poorly of both men.This film has a big cast, and some well-known names. Rob Lowe is terrific as a humorously bizarre plastic surgeon. Debbie Reynolds, as Lee's elderly mother, is so good that she is unrecognizable. Nearly all of the actors give fine performances. Michael Douglas especially deserves credit given that Liberace's mannerisms and image are so well known.Lavish custom costumes, detailed and elaborate production design, tons of subtle and not-so-subtle makeup all combine to add enormously to the story's credibility, as does the cinematography. Interior lighting makes Liberace's on-stage performances come alive. Music is, not unexpectedly, what Liberace liked, to some extent stuffy and old-fashioned.I was never a Liberace fan. But he was a much-beloved entertainer and talented pianist, who had a long show business career. That the Hollywood studios turned this script down tells us a great deal about Hollywood. The real hero in this film is not a character so much as it is HBO. Maybe there is hope that quality films can still be made, despite cowardly industry insiders.",positive
Blue Jay,"I know black and white is supposed to be artsy and mood creating, but I'm a color kind of guy, sorry. I also felt like they both played the awkwardness too hard at the beginning. And, as usual for me, I'd like a bit more background details up front- about both characters, and more scenes from around the town. Finally the ending was not my kind...........maybe not a live happily ever after, but at least SOMETHING!",negative
Blue Jay,"It's the first review I'm writing. Actually, I've never felt the need of writing a review- thought that the score I give is already a good contribution. But Blue Jay is something else. It's the most genuine feeling I've ever felt while watching a movie, in the sense the once I finished it, I didn't feel than it was far from my own reality at all. The way nostalgia was pictured is fascinating. The words that were used were so close to the words that I would have used myself in such a situation that sometimes, I've found myself saying out loud, at the same time, what one of them were saying.Magical, genuine, sweet, emotional, simple, true. Brilliant.",positive
Mary Shelley,"I'm a sucker for artist biog movies.The storyline is interesting to keep you watching - well, keep me watching, anyway - as it runs through the events and experiences which supposedly contributed to the writing of Frankenstein. I don't know enough about her actual history to say how true or not is is but it seems feasible in a movie sort of way.One aspect of life at that time it does highlight is the (little) regard in which women and creative women were held.The stars are excellent. Douglas Booth in particular makes a text-book Shelly.So, what's wrong with it?Well, it generally lacks drive and it's not as gripping as you're probably entitled to think a movie about the creator of Frankenstein should be. There are masses of fantastic characters - Shelly, Byron, Godwin, Polidori - but their interactions are mundane. There is one tense scene where Shelly and Byron meet but it all just fizzles out and reverts to the mundaneness which had gone before.It's interesting as a possible biog and worth watching if you enjoy these types of movie but it just doesn't have the pizazz to make it stand out.",negative
Mary Shelley,"I affectionately commend Director Haifaa Al-Mansour's astute and tender depiction of the life of Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin (Mary Shelley), played by the talented Elle Fanning. I loved the entire cast. It was beautifully written. I have not watched a movie that has touched me so deeply in quite some time. It brought tears to my eyes and made me truly understand the novel Frankenstein at an even deeper level. I have a profound respect for the novel now, which was truly unconventional for the period. Mary Shelley creatively portrayed the feminist plight in the early 19th century by using a male character in the form of a monster. At the time, I doubt that anyone who read it when it was distributed without the name of the author took it as more than a horror story. She went from publisher to publisher and no one really got it or gave it a chance because she was a woman. I loved that they show the relationship between Mary and her father, who never truly abandons her, but grooms her and believes in her even though he does not always agree with her choices. It is a love story and a detailed memoir of Mary Shelley's plight as a woman living in that century. Anyone who has ever been young and in love should be touched. It is a reminder of that period in life when we are all trying to find ourselves despite religion, culture, and family beliefs. Al-Mansour shows the good, the bad and the ugly in people's characters through the various characters in the movie. She also shows that true love between people is them accepting each other for who they really are and standing by them despite their flaws. Frankenstein was created with the hopes and expectations that he would be the perfect human being. However, like all humans, he is inevitably flawed, and therefore unloved, and unwanted by those who cannot truly love unconditionally or see the beauty beyond the external appearance. I usually do not rate anything at a 9 but I was happily surprised by Al-Mansour's vision. I loved the originality and the risks she took in making this adaptation of Mary Shelley's journey from a child to a well-known and highly admired novelist. Again, I love that her father played such a vital role in providing her with the confidence, respect, and love that made her such a strong woman. While she had her mother's personality and fiery spirit, it was tempered by her father's belief in her abilities and his constant acknowledgement that she had a beautifully creative mind. Her father challenged her to be her very best.",positive
5 to 7,"The first rule of a romance film is that lead actors need to have on-screen chemistry. The second rule is that you empathise with them enough to become involved and care about them.I'm afraid neither of these two factors existed. There is no way a beautiful, classy, sophisticated woman would show an interest in an average looking, unimaginative, wide eyed boy. Not that age matters, or even looks but the script simply didn't bring any depth or personality to the male lead, so there is nothing more than the superficial to consider.The acting is wooden, the script is infeasible, stilted and unnatural. Also, as another reviewer commented, there is a French stereotype that is observable in many films which is inappropriate and inaccurate and confining.Woody Allen could have used the remit of this film to make a gem.",negative
5 to 7,"I will admit that the film had me in the first few seconds. That it was no accident made it even more appreciated. That it fulfilled its promise by the end left me thinking, smiling and feeling good. A lot of care, love and thought had gone into making a story about likable people who are complex characters. Please, give me more. The script, the acting, the camera work and the perfect pace, made it all a beautiful pastiche of quiet and quality film-making. Yes please, give me more. But it would be helpful if these gems are not hidden away from the public. Thank God for Netflix. I've searched for some information on the film after watching it and saw that this was a debut for Victor Levin as a director. I am looking forward to more.",positive

The Last Summer,"Okay so I just randomly watched this because it didn't look as bad as other Netflix ""teen"" movies and I liked the fact that it took place in Chicago. The first hour of the movie was really cringey, bad, and painful to watch but honestly after that hour? The second hour was actually pretty good. I was expecting some of the storylines to turn out really stupid but they actually turned themselves around and surprised me. I don't think it's spoilery to say that at the end there wasn't really an unlikeable main character or a main character that didn't have character growth. And some bits I actually found funny, which I wasn't expecting.
If you want to watch it, I say go for it, just stick with it through that first hour and then it gets better.",positive
Every Day,"I absolutely loved the book, and was thrilled to know that it was being released as a movie - until I watched it, and was heartbroken. The perspective is told entirely from Rihannon's point of view, whereas the book is completely from A's. An entire side-plot related to Nathan was completely dropped, barely mentioned as an aside, and pointless characters were given lots of screen time while hardly having a mention in the book. Mechanics of A's ability are completely changed just to suit the 'teen romance' of the movie, and what I felt were important body switches, showing real diversity, were either completely ignored, or underplayed. The movie could've done so much for representation, but it just didn't care to.If you can watch this and separate from the book, or aren't reading the book at all, honestly it plays as an averagely low-budget, dull teen movie, with nothing special going for it.",negative
Every Day,"When I read the description I was skeptical about this movie but 10 seconds into the trailer I was absolutely 100% ALL IN. This has to be one of the greatest movies I have seen in my 21 years of life. The acting was brilliant, the plot amazing, but the MESSAGE ?? OMG IF YOU DONT CATCH THE MESSAGE TOWARD THE MIDDLE TO THE END THEN WHATS WRONG WITH YOU ?!!? VERY POWERFUL MESSAGE AND OVER AMAZING MOVIE.",positive
Little,"It's hard to tell who this movie is for, children or adults. It's too boring for adults but many adult scenes make it unsuitable for children. The worst thing is that it's unbearable to watch if you are sitting next to your children to watch it in a ""family night"". My mother and sister fell asleep, and if I wasn't hungry/in need of a bathroom, I would have too. Speaking of which, it's impossibly long for what it is. It does not use time effectively at all. It's poorly written and detailed where it shouldn't while undetailed where it should. I can only praise it's diverse cast, but it's ruined with poor lines, poor jokes and overall terrible plot.
The concept in Big, is exploring what a creative and eager mind of a child, could do with the ""freedom"" of an adult; it was basically, magical. This movie, on the other hand, very poorly explores the bitterness of childhood. Not only it was not magical, but barely anything of the plot relied on being ""little"", but rather most of the plot centered on the adult life of the ""little"" person. Because, so *little* emphasis was dedicated to the young life of the main character, conflict resolution felt poorly executed, unrealistic and essentially, corny and cringe-worthy as hell. One of the reasons I was talked into watching this movie was the acting of the child main character, which, was ok, but not enough to make the movie one bit interesting. There are one, or two laughs in the movie as well, and for a moment, one might thing the movie is not totally hopeless, but you'll soon noticed that you'll be disappointed. Also, it's crazy how lots of reviews are essentially *bad* reviews, but they give the movie scores like 6/10. I think they just want to be ""kind"" or maybe they are shy about giving bad reviews a bad score. Or maybe they think 6/10 is a bad score, but don't be fooled. This movie is a solid 1/10, at most 2/10 if you are a child, perhaps.",negative
Little,"It's hard these days to find a great comedy (the writing is either too corny or the casting is WAY off). LITTLE, however, was all around perfect in the writing and casting. The concept is familiar, yes, but the film managed to include it's own little twist with wise take-homes of living a more confident life full of LOVE, by way of forgiving your past. Regina Hall and Issa Rae naturally brought their characters to life, in a way that pulled me in throughout the entire movie. Equally outstanding was the performance by young actress Marsai Martin. She so effortlessly delivered a hilarious, yet mature performance as an ""adult"" and truly captured the demeanor and attitude of her adult self in the movie. The fact that Little only has a 50 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, when the movie's EXTREMELY funny, lets me know the site is nothing more than the title suggests; a Rotten Tomato.",positive
Playing It Cool,"Which is a startling achievement.The definition of smug is ""having or showing an excessive pride in oneself or one's achievements."" And this strange, self-conscious, and terribly annoying film takes that notion to levels I have never seen.Which is saying something because I watch (and review) a lot of films.The smugness is so extreme that -- a horrible failing for a reviewer -- I am at pains to describe it.It uses devices to enhance its smugness which, when the script was initially being pitched to the money guys, must have sounded positively brilliant, but, in reality, are as much fun as a root canal.It starts with massive backstory -- but. then gives you a giant screen caption ""backstory"" so YOU know the WRITER KNOWS that this. and therefore you are part of an INSIDE JOKE.It dispenses clichés like an ATM that has taken a lightening strike. Memories of a sexy babysitter, a mother who abandoned the narrator, friends who want to go to Malaysia because the women there appreciate under-sized appendages (""and you can rip them up""); old girlfriends who, after a single phone call, will meet you at a street corner, hop in your car, and perform an oral act below window level while the local cop nods approvingly....It is almost as if --- this seems to be the real story -- someone in Hollywood, on a dare, was asked to take the worst script he could find and get it produced with a handful of A-List stars.And actually won the bet.I like to talk about ""connection"" in my reviews and how important it is for the viewer to relate to the material on screen. The only way for a viewer to connect with this film is if the viewer is currently institutionalized for psychotic narcissism.Perhaps I am not being clear. This is not merely a bad film, because a lot of Indies are called that when in fact they actually represent someone's attempt to make a really good film ... which failed.This is a bad film because someone who considers themselves smarter than everyone else in the room went out of their way to prove it.Which, as I said, makes it the smuggest film ever made.(Go back to top line of review. Wash. Repeat.)",negative
Playing It Cool,"I agree with most what has been said here in other reviews. I think this movie tries to be nice, cool, different. But what moves a story is conflict and there are basically 3 oppositions to the main character: the inner conflict, the girl refusal and the boyfriend. Problem is, the girl is so nice, so smiling, so special, so ""oh i love her"", that I couldn't really get why she refuses to date the main character. Really, what is her problem? The boyfriend is unaware of her friendship with the guy, and never shows up, only sometimes. We can't really define his character. There is no personality.And what is left is the inner conflict, the voice over, the cool writer friends giving advices in order to build an idea of love.Seriouly?",positive
Sherlock Gnomes,Utter pants film whose best bit was the voice from Ozzy. Even my young son predicted the ending before it happened and the jokes were pretty pants at best,negative
Sherlock Gnomes,"Breaking news from London-garden gnomes have been kidnapped! ""Oh fertilizer!"" This is one of many amusing jokes from the very British characters in Sherlock Gnomes, sequel to the 2011 animated film Gnomeo and Juliet. Although the plot of this family-friendly movie is somewhat predictable, it is still quite funny and clever. In this sequel, the formerly star-crossed lovers Gnomeo (James McAvoy) and Juliet (Emily Blunt) are married and have just moved to London where they are appointed by their parents as joint heads of the garden. Both Juliet and Gnomeo feel the pressures of their new leadership roles and the marriage begins to suffer through lack of communication and mutual appreciation. Meanwhile, their gnome friends are disappearing from homes all over London, and they attempt to search for and save them. With the help of Sherlock Gnomes (Johnny Depp) and Watson (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the adventure begins - to defeat the evil pie company called Moriarty (Jamie Demetriou) and save all gnomes. We also see that poor Watson is quite ignored and under-appreciated by Sherlock.My favorite aspects of this movie are the music, Johnny Depp and the ""planning"" sequences. I love the song choices used in transitions between scenes. If you are a fan of Sir Elton John, you will be pleased to hear many of his hits, including ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart,"" ""I'm Still Standing,"" ""Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting"" and a fantastic new song performed by the great Mary J. Blige. Johnny Depp is hilarious with his condescending British accent. I have seen almost every movie he has ever been in and he never disappoints with his comedic intensity. Another interesting thing that happens is when we see the inner workings of Sherlock's mind in 2-D black-and-white animation. One clinker for me is when super-intelligent Watson, looking for Gnomeo, says ""Gnomeo, Gnomeo! Oh don't make me say it - wherefore art thou, Gnomeo?"" (Of course ""wherefore"" means ""why"" in Romeo and Juliet.)The message of this story is a good one - that you will succeed by respecting the people who support you. Sherlock learns that lesson when he realizes that Watson feels that Sherlock isn't listening to him or respecting him. Juliet learns it when she realizes that Gnomeo feels as if Juliet is ignoring him, too.I rate this film 5 out of 5 stars because, almost all the scenes kept me laughing, the music is great, and I love the message. I recommend this movie for ages 7 to 18.Reviewed by Lucia F, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org.",positive
Fallen,"Movie was rushed and did not have an end. Did she survive? When the movie ended, all I was thinking was WTF. What happened to the friend? Did the angels bring her back to life? They said they would take care of her. What happened to the girl? Did she survive? The movie left me with more question than answers. The movie could have been so much better. There was too much focus on on it being artsy, not enough on the story line. The plot had no end.",negative
Fallen,If you had to compare the novel and the movie. I would go for the novel but the recreation of the novel was exceptional even though there are some few key pointers that are missing I'm happy actually. I found it to be really brilliant that it felt more that I was watching a movie then I was actually reading the book it felt like its own secondary concept on the side and if there's a second movie I would watch it.I was slightly disappointed how quickly it ended. It did feel complete but by human habit it didn't for filling the spot. That's why I recommend for the next movie to be made. Highly recommend it.If it was recreated to a series I feel as though it would be a run down like The Secret Circle. So over all I would watch it over and over again until the last book is recreated.,positive
All I See Is You,"I feel like this had the potential to be a great thriller, but there's so many things that went wrong so sadly I can't say it is. The main problem is the pacing, there's just no build up of suspense for the majority of the movie, and so the final sequence of events happen so quickly so as to almost feel rushed. Also whereas the husband is clearly meant to be the antagonist in the story, and the wife is the heroine, there's just something that doesn't quite sit right with me about her, and I feel like both characters come off as quite unlikeable by the end. I mean I know it was really bad for him to change the eye drops, so sure I can accept him as the bad guy, he got it coming to him in the end. But as for the wife let's just put it this way, when she gets her vision back she becomes quite rude towards her husband, self centred, sleeps with another guy, then lies about it and even has a baby which she clearly tries to pass off as the husband's, and then pretends that she's still blind when she can actually see, and by the end after he kills himself and she has the baby it's like it was supposedly a good turn of events, like a sort of redemption. There's a feminist quality to the protagonist, and by regaining her sight it distills this power within her, and that by challenging her newfound self empowerment the husband became the villain. The funny thing is that I felt more sympathy for the husband for the most of the movie... hell maybe that's just me, but I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of people who like this movie are women, but either way it's just bad.So to answer the initial question 'It's not really a thriller, so what's it supposed to be?', well it's kind of like a very average drama with unlikeable characters, really not a good combination. But if we could take away any real moral from the story it's that people can change, and not just from regaining eyesight, these things happen, and you just have to be careful about heavily investing your life into someone when they can completely change. And to realise when you are both no longer compatible for each other and when to walk away. Clearly this movie deals with this in a very negative way, and ultimately the ending was just downright depressing.",negative
All I See Is You,"I think the low reviews come from people who enjoy action thrillers with over the top plot twists.
This is a movie about human nature, explored in a very unique way. How would your life change if you went blind then could suddenly see again many years later after moving on with life?
This is not a faced paced film, but instead hooks you in with beautiful details, a constant subtle suspense, and a unique filming point of view. Blake Lively is captivating and says so much with little words.
Completely underrated and unappreciated.
Open you mind, and eyes, and give this film a go.",positive
Earthquake Bird,"Movie starts off quite well arousing the viewer's intrigue. It is set in a really interesting background, Japan in the 80s. Alicia Vikander's acting skills and beautiful cinematography kept my attention. Every little detail seemed to be heading for a dramatic ending perhaps a really intelligent twist. However, movie becomes all over the place in the second half ending abruptly without much of a conclusion. In the end I felt like being let down and totally unsatisfied.",negative

A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night,"Some filmmakers are so masterful they don't need a coherent plot or much of anything to happen on-screen. They hypnotize and memorize us with the basics of film as art, the marriage of moving pictures and sound. Then comes along a little foreign film called A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night.The opening looks like a spaghetti Western yet sounds like a French art film. We immediately like the protagonist. He is patient, determined, likes cats and works hard to get what he wants. Though he is a decent man, he is weak and far from perfect. His trouble starts due to his father's heroin addiction. After the first 30 minutes, his trouble seems to be over. As the film begins to loose our initial interest, it moves slower and slower until it becomes almost painful to watch.The story takes place in Bad City, which is like where the world of David Lynch's Eraserhead meets Sin City. As exciting as that sounds in concept, the lackluster screenplay spoils any hope of excitement. About half way through, the film reveals itself as a love story. However, this lacks the tender magic of Let the Right One In. The characters are interesting enough but the suspense is wondering what this is all building up to. The film hints at a grand finale. A revenge-fueled blood bath of an ending. Unfortunately, it seems writer/director Ana Lily Amirpour wanted to make a Robert Rodriquez/Quentin Tarantino inspired film without any violence.For a horror film, it isn't scary. For a romance, it lacks passion. For a thriller, it is void of any thrills. In the end, it comes off as a piece of pretentious art-house cinema only suited for international film festival audiences. As good as the film looks and as slow as the story moves, it lacks the hypnotic quality of a master like Jim Jarmusch. It literally feels as if the filmmakers ran out of money before they could shoot the finale.This is one of the most unsatisfying and deceiving films ever made. It's like going to a boxing match or UFC fight and the announcer comes out saying, ""Sorry folks, the fighters came to a diplomatic solution and decided violence wasn't the answer. They're off riding bikes under a rainbow now.""",negative
A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night,"Greetings from Lithuania.""A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night"" (2014) is a bizarre experience. It has cool idea and concept is intriguing, although the movie itself isn't. First off all lets make it clear - ""A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night"" is not a horror movie - not at all. It has some horror movie sequences (for 1 min. total) but it's not a horror movie - don't be mislead by wrong advertisement. It's a bizarre and poorly constructed mix of genres stretching from drama, to thriller, to horror to comedy to whatever... - nothing in here works for a compelling picture. Here is the bad word for describing a movie - boring. Yes, this movie is simply boring. For running time 1 h 35 min this movie drags beyond boringness, i was looking at the left time like each 7 min. and honestly - i finished watching this movie in 3 days - seriously.Overall, this flick has had a clearly good idea of creating something unique and unseen, but in my opinion in doing it it failed to make a interesting movie in first place. I can watch whatever there is story if only it's made interestingly, you know, when there is a good script, good acting, directing. This one lacks the good story. It's just a scenes of some sort of vampire going around and killing people who we meet 10 min ago (no spoilers - but they were kinda bad people) - that's it. And then there is a dude with no background or story and a cat. The cat was the best thing in this movie. He should be nominated, while in the mean time the movie should be forgotten.",positive
The Necessary Death of Charlie Countryman,"As an educated man, who thinks he has very good taste in movies, I feel very confident in what I'm about to say. This movie was horrible. I felt like the director slept in his trailer while the boom mike fella was guiding the film. Wow. The only thing that kept me 30 movies into the movie were all the boobs in the hostel scene. How do I begin? 1) Charlie leaves airport with bag, gets out of taxi, no bag.2) He talks to girl (Evan Rachel Wood) that just smelled his shirt because it smelled like her father, then she looks at him like he's a rapist when he wants to get into her car to find her dead father.3)You can film in Romania, you can get Romanian taxi drivers etc, but you can't find a Romanian beauty for the lead? What?! Her accent was not even close to believable and the excessive work trying to make her look edgy or East European missed the mark entirely. How about getting an authentic Romanian actress! Major major FAIL. She totally distracts from everything else happening.4) They talk for 5 minutes when (Wood) cant find her father, then HE, new to the country, with no idea where he is or where he's going wants to drive her car to find her dead fathers ambulance. What? Then...THEN....they start driving to find this speeding ambulance and somehow the ambulance must have done a HUGE U-turn of sorts and they SLAM INTO the very ambulance they're looking for. Wait, it gets better.5) Then when the ambulance gets hit, of COURSE the rear doors fly open because why wouldn't they?, and her DEAD DAD who was not STRAPPED to the gurney of course, flys through the air in his body bag. WHAT A JOKE. That's when they started losing me.6) The cop scene where he gets TAZED for picking up a hat and then interrogated like he just smuggled 10 kilo's of Columbian Bam Bam into the country was pointless, stupid, and not even close to reality.7) Really, when a dude dies in an airplane they just let him sit in the seat and throw a blankie on him and give you a drink to shut you up? What? 8)Charlie checks into a hostel where everyone is making out, decides to go topless (only good part of the movie. Hey I'm a guy) and the management suddenly yells as if Charlie is some long lost friend..Whatever.9) No Charlie, you cannot come VIT me, it could get you killed....so Charlie takes a few more steps and then it's like they're dating and she forgets all about her advice to him.Don't even waste your time unless you like seeing breasts. That's the only thing this movie is good for.",negative
The Necessary Death of Charlie Countryman,"(The Necessary Death of Charlie Countryman) *Plot Synopsis* (minor spoilers) Charlie Countryman has witnessed his mothers death and it is apparent that he is not comfortable being around death. I mean who is? He also seems to have a gift which enables him to communicate to the dead just after they have died. This supernatural aspect plays a small and big role in the film at the same time. Well his mothers ""ghost"" has requested for him to go to Bucharest, Romania for no real reason. So he does. On the airplane ride there, he sits next to Victor, who he befriends quickly. Suddenly and awkwardly, Victor dies in his sleep during the ride. His ""ghost"", then requests him to give a gift to his daughter. This is when Charlie meets the beautiful Gabi. From there on, Charlie will experience an adventure of emotions and the dangerous consequences of his decisions, which in the end, ultimately makes him feel love.I'm not saying the critics are always right or always wrong. Sometimes the critics love a movie and the public hates it. Sometimes they hate a movie and the public hates it. Sometimes they love a movie and the public loves it. Well this is one of those rare cases where the critics hate the movie, but the public mostly adores it. I mean, come on. This movie is much better than the 27% it has on Rotten Tomatoes. I am so surprised at the negativity this movie is getting from the press.This was honestly one of the most interesting and beautiful films I have experienced. The acting from Shia Lebouf as a confused lost young man is topnotch. He gives his best performance to date. Sadly the Oscars are out of the question apparently. A lot of the acting comes from his facial expressions of sadness and sorrow. The supporting cast also do a great job. Evan Rachel Wood plays the hurt and mysterious Gabi perfectly as well. The best of the supporting cast has to be given to Mads Mikkelsen who plays the dangerous and smooth crazy ex of Gabi, Nigel. Every scene he is in is ominous. He is almost an evil James Bond type of character in this film. Oh, and Rupert Grint AKA Ronald Weasley also has a humorous minor role as well.The cinematography is stunning. Every scene, every single shot can be paused and screen-shot and hung on a wall as a piece of art. The look of this film is truly what you would expect a living painting to look like. It's as if someone took a camera and jumped inside a piece of art at a Museum. Like another reviewer said, the movie feels like a live action Graphic Novel at times. The setting of Bucharest really plays a huge role as the backdrop to most of the film. It is a really beautiful city. I'd compare the feeling of it to the feeling of Bruges in ""In Bruges"".The soundtrack sets the tone well. I almost cried several times during the film thanks to the musical score or song choices combined with the directing and brilliant acting. Take note that I barely ever cry ever. That's how good this movie worked. I must also point out that one of my favorite bands M83 has a song featured in the final scene perfectly!Lastly, this film is hard to categorize. At times it is a drama. Then in an instant it has small comedic elements. Then suddenly it becomes a action film. Take all of these and combine them and set the movie in a beautiful city like Bucharest, and you have a great film. Of course, there are some plot holes, but it never gets to the point of confusion. At no point in the film did I feel like I missed something. I have no idea what these critics watched, but it definitely wasn't the same movie I just watched. What I saw was an A list film that deserves great praise. I still cannot get over how beautiful the movie looked. Even if you don't love the story, you cannot deny how gorgeous each scene is without any use of CGI. True eye candy. If you need something interesting and different to watch, then I highly recommend this movie as a rental, purchase, or even a Netflix choice. I would watch it again the next chance I get.",positive
You Get Me,"Watching this film was something of a transcendental, magical experience for me, as normally if you're watching a bad film on TV, DVD or specifically Netflix, if you don't like it, you can just turn it off and eat some cheese, for instance. However, watching this Netflix exclusive that looked promising on paper (I didn't watch any trailers) so I thought I'd give it a go, and what was there was so terrible I had to keep watching it just to absorb the awfulness of it.For starters, this film is basically the latest in a long line of Fatal Attraction knock-offs, and sweet hell I'm sick of this being a thing; Fatal Attraction wasn't a classic purely from its plot, but from its filmmaking, writing, score, and containing one of the most cerebral villains in Glenn Close's Alex. Every copy of this thinks that by having the ""dude has an affair, woman's insane, tries to have the dude for herself at all costs"" forgets one basic thing - MAKE IT ****ING GOOD! And so does this.Biggest offset here for why this film is terrible, is that the setting doesn't mesh with this plot: these are 17 year old high school kids, doing basic stuff like shop and surf and hardly ever work, not adults with actual stuff to lose for instance. It demeans the plot, and makes it feel like a tween film trying to pose as an adult film. And this is shown through all of the characters, and I can only think of one likable one, but I'll talk about her in a second.The main character, Tyler, is without a doubt, one of the most unlikable lead characters I've ever seen. This is a guy who both talks and acts like a vacuous douche, and in his lowest moment, at the very beginning of the film, paints himself with no positive traits: this guy, who's been going out his girlfriend, Allison, for about 3 months without having slept with her, meets someone from her past, who talks about how ""no-one sucked it like her"", and he IMMEDIATELY breaks up with her without defending her in any way, and then goes and sleeps with this random girl Holly, but not once - for an ENTIRE WEEKEND, repeatedly, in a damn montage. I'm sorry, but these don't make for a good Protagonist, especially given by the end he's learned nothing, except ""don't sleep with crazy people"".It also doesn't help that this cast is made up of Vine stars, previously glorified cameo parts, and Bella Thorne who is the most notable actress, and in the role as the film villain Holly/Elizabeth. Let's talk about this character: I, ironically, don't get her. She wants someone to love her, so she will hurt anyone who gets between her and any boy she fancies, was send to a mental facility but is still able to go to school with everyone else and...like I said, the age and setting doesn't help this because the mental illness angle, which would offer genuine fear, is totally untapped. She's also as subtle as plane crash in a car park. And the only reason no-one buys her bs is because almost everyone in this film is a moron. She claims pregnancy by Tyler, despite the very obvious lack of physical changes over the period that this film goes on for, gets Tyler excluded from assault on a simple accusation, and also manages to go by Holly to EVERYONE in school except the teachers who call her Elizabeth. How did no-one notice this?? They're in classes together - the teachers take a verbal register! The one character who is likable is Lydia, played by Anna Akana, who Holly almost kills by causing her an anaphylactic shock. She is the ONLY one that puts two-and-two together, and that's the only reason she's likable: she's not an idiot.Now, the film's ending, if I have enough space to talk about it, takes the self-grandious, pompous, ""love conquers all"" message to whole new levels. Also with a really fair few dumb moments, that I'll list:Holly creates a noose, to hang Allison supposedly. The next scene, we see she's tied Allison to a chair, and put the chair dangling in the air. Whilst I doubt a very skinny girl could put weight that high, I'm more interested in why if she wanted her dead, why not just hang her?In a final chase, Holly shoots Tyler through the shoulder, and then while distracted, Allison stabs her through the side with a fire poker. She survives this. She survives being stabbed through the abdomen by a curled metal tool with a hook on it.After she survives this, she starts hitting on the random paramedic who takes her to hospital, implying a repeat of the cycle. I refer to my ""I don't get her"" statements for this.Tyler gives this voice-over about how close he came to death that night, and how now, in the end, love conquers all. Neither are true; he was shot in the shoulder, that doesn't kill you, it just hurts, and love never conquered all, for you, because this all happened because you threw ""love"" away. Also, in the end it seems everyone forgets about what happened. I don't know about you, but I'd find that s**t pretty hard to forget to be honest.In short, ***K this movie! Watch Fatal Attraction instead. Much better, and actually delivers on its thrills.",negative
You Get Me,"This film grabbed everything from every obsession film ever made, and twisted it into something very very awful.",positive
Holding the Man,"I really really liked this movie! It was a relentless and at times confronting experience, but proof positive that storytelling when it is steeped in such truth and such life experience, in the hands of brilliant storytellers results in exemplary cinema. Neil Armfield has long been a leading light in Australian theatre, and I had nearly forgotten his feature 'Candy' with Heath Ledger and Abbie Cornish, but was reminded of it, as I sat spellbound by the performances in 'Holding The Man' and its expert direction and attention to detail. Being in the audience for this movie, I felt safe in the hands of a master director. Ryan Corr, best known for the small screen like 'Packed to the Rafters' is a revelation; throwing himself head first into this leading role and intrepidly going where I suspect few actors might go. Craig Stott was a discovery for me, and although I struggled with some of the early scenes and wardrobe choices, his performance was realised as a truly moving and career making turn. Lots of great actors in supporting roles and cameos including the hilarious Kerry Walker in a blink and you'll miss it part. There's lots of humour, lots of pathos and lots of sexual activity which is thoughtfully and bravely brought to the screen. This is a must see experience, a story that needed to be told and has honoured the actor/writer Timothy Conigrave in so doing. Aussie filmmaking at its very finest.",negative
Holding the Man,"When you rate a film a 10, the review is harder because it usually means you are gushing with so much good news about the film, that you don't know where to begin.I'll just hit three points, and to be safe, I'M REPEATING MY SPOILER ALERT HERE. THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. 1. The casting is fantastic. The chemistry between Ryan and Craig is unlike anything I've ever seen in film, and I'm an oldie with an almost catalog knowledge of classic films. So, going back to the 1930s, I can't remember when I've seen two on-screen lovers who were more engaging and compelling. By the time the story ends, you feel like you gained and lost two great friends, so REAL is their relationship with each other. It translates over to a wonderful invitation to US, and we end up feeling lost when we lose them. (Yes, because this movie sticks with one well after one has seen it, I may be clouded by that glow, but, for now, that is my assessment of their chemistry.) 2. If you lived through the '80s and early '90s, as an adult, this film will resonate well and actually dredge up some horrifying memories of the time. If you have children in their 20s, it's even more oddly devastating to see (double spoiler alert here) two men being given a death sentence in their mid-twenties. (Triple spoiler alert here.) Although it takes years for the executioner to arrive, they are handed that death sentence at a very young age (25 - John; and 26 - Tim). To watch them have to cope with that as a couple, to see them thrown into such a nightmare at such a young age is tragic on an epic level. The day they get the bad news, they should be thinking about first jobs and maybe buying a car. It's astounding what they are instead handed. The grace with which they approach it is heartbreaking to watch.3. (Quadruple spoiler alert here.) Hearing Tim's voice at the end SLAYS. The constant stiff upper lip of both of their journeys is the thing that makes this film stick with you for hours or days after you see it. It's the dictionary definition of impressive. It impresses itself on you with its hard truths and horrid reality: Two people you grow to love leave you at the end of the film, and they do it bravely. It breaks your heart and leaves you with a strange longing.",positive
Irrational Man,"When deciding to go to Irrational Man, I believed to be in for a treat. As a philosophy major struggling with an occasional existential crisis, I thought it might be cool to see a movie about a philosopher in similar peril. Although the movie starts our rather promising, it quickly lapses into utter disaster. About halfway you can stop watching as you know exactly how it will end and you might even be able to anticipate exactly what the actors are going to say. The movie is quite the opposite of a scenario in which you recognize only at the last moment that the situation is going dire. You do not really get sucked into the performance, but you just see random people uttering lines of text. The philosophy used can be taken from one introductory course but no real errors are made, except for running into dozens of cliché's. The dramatic ending resulted in hysterical laughter throughout the theater, not because it was funny, but because it was so poor. In fact, I have gone through the trouble of creating an account, just to be able to point out that this movie is a waste of time.",negative
Irrational Man,"All in this pic is wonderful, the ambient, the actors... this couple is the most strange but lovely. Idk please see the movie",positive
Lady Macbeth,"This film tries to do some interesting things, but it fails.
It tries to be a feminist critique of old fashioned sexism, and so we have a young woman whose father has sold her to an abusive husband who controls her and is unable to show any affection for her. Where it goes from there is an absurd slippery slope. Her first subtle step toward disobeying her husband leads her headlong into sociopathic selfishness. I could almost handle that as a statement of ""look what oppression does to people,"" but other details in the film suggest the message that women are better under control. She was immediately attracted to a man whom she caught leading a group sexual assault on another woman, and she stifled her feelings until the man forced himself into her room and sexually assaulted her (I mean, what girl can resist a rapist).
The plot was tense, and I watched it partly out of intrigue and partly out of curiosity. There were a number of complications throughout, but they became progressively less believable. The writer seemed to have thought less about the logic/motivation of each new twist, and by the end, the turns in the plot had become consistently both absurd and unsurprising. I gave up trying to find a way to explain the ridiculous choices the characters made because they were largely unexplainable.
The casting was the final weirdness. A great deal of the cast were black actors. Had this been a light-hearted comedy or action flick, I would have been okay with the anachronistic lack of racism, but since it was a starkly realistic film focused on ugly human behavior, it makes no sense to pretend that that one didn't exist in that time and place. A glaring example of this is when a black woman walks into the home of a white woman in 19th century Scotland and makes demands of her, demands which the white woman seems powerless to resist. I feel weird complaining that a black character had social power in a film's story, but in the context, it feels wrong. Not only were there very few people of African descent in that time in Scotland, but they certainly would not have been able to lord themselves over white people, as that particular character did to the protagonist. I can't help wondering if the director just wanted to earn progressive points by saying at parties (to other white people of course) that he had hired some of ""those people"" for his film.",negative
Lady Macbeth,"This small independent film from the United Kingdom is an astonishing portrait of the bleak realities of how Scottish culture viewed class, race, and (especially) gender in the nineteenth century. The film does this without ever needing to be preachy or overtly politically correct. It is very dark and rather disturbing, and it will get under your skin--but it is brilliantly made. It is the best film of the year so far. It should also, however, be noted that this film is not an adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Macbeth."" Rather, it is an adaptation of a Russian novel about a woman who begins to exhibit deranged behaviors after being forced into an arranged--and loveless--marriage.Despite using minimal set pieces and little music, the aesthetics of this film are truly sublime. They add to the simple feel of the film, rather than the extravagant sense of many period dramas. The costume design is also simple rather than outlandish or flamboyant. Once again, this makes the film feel realistic and tense, rather than removed from reality. The film's cinematography is top-notch as well, reflecting the dark tone of the film in its entirety. Florence Pugh is exceptional in the lead role as Katherine. Despite the actions that her character commits in the second half of the film, she manages to generate sympathy while still portraying herself as a twisted individual--almost an impossible trick to pull off. But what elevates this film to utter brilliance is that it is not solely a defense of her--or a defense of anyone. Rather, it is simply a unique reflection on the notion of social status at the time period that skewers all preconceived notions of judgment--including morals and morality--to the point of ambiguous analysis. The film's true messages are quite complex, even though its direct plot is not difficult to follow. This is why even simple, dialogue-free scenes such as moments when the camera stares at Katherine's face as she is seated, tell you so much about her as a character and her mood to a degree that I have not really seen in any film of recent memory. Such complexity, though, is what makes the film an unforgettable watch. (Of course, the uniquely simple look and feel to the film and its excellent, slow-burn-style pacing also contributes greatly to it.) Recommended to the highest degree. 10/10",positive
Romeo & Juliet,"I am in two minds about this film: On the one hand I can honestly say that I enjoyed it and that it swept me away in the timeless love story. On the other hand there are several things that really bothered me and that I believe would disqualify it from being classified a ""good"" film.Firstly, the bad:1) The movie doesn't follow Shakespeare's original text. Sure enough, the most famous lines are all there, but the movie frequently deviates from Shakespeare's text. The simplification of some text insults the intelligence of the audience and does seem a little arrogant on the parts of the screenwriters. It also doesn't help that much of the changes has the feel of modern speech being rewritten in an ""old-english-sounding"" tongue which clearly stands out from the classic words of the bard. Not even the ending escapes some liberal changes. 2)Hailee Steinfeld is really a bad casting decision for Juliet. She is simply so much younger than Romeo that their on-screen chemistry looks a bit creepy. Her portrayal of Juliet lacks depth and she simply does not possess the beauty to be a Juliet - especially if you pair her with Douglas Booth as Romeo. (Another reviewer complained that Romeo is more beautiful than Juliet in this film and I have to agree that this is true)Now for the good: 1) Bringing fierceness and intense passion to the role, I thought Douglas Booth was a really good Romeo. 2) Paul Giamatti is excellent as Friar Laurence. He brings some comic relief, lightness and heart to the film. 3) The story is fast-paced, passionate and intense. Enough of Shakespeare's most-loved soliloquies and dialogue appear to retain the timeless beauty of his words. The words still bring layer upon layer of meaning to the story and brings so much depth and emotion to the story of the star-crossed lovers that one can't help but wander at just how Shakespeare was able to get so much emotion into so few lines.I give this film a score of 7 as I quite enjoyed it despite it's flaws. Don't watch this movie if you have to do a school project on Romeo and Juliet, though!",negative
Romeo & Juliet,"If you enjoy the immortal words of Shakespeare's eponymous play then DO NOT SEE THIS FILM! I only stayed for an hour and that is an hour of my life I will never get back. I'm baffled as to how anyone could bastardise Shakspeare to such an extent that it was almost unrecognisable.It really was 'Shakespeare for Dummies' rewritten by a man who is clearly so arrogant as to think the general public couldn't possibly understand or enjoy the original text. Job well done Mr Fellowes because I barely recognised any of it so if that was your intention then, bravo! You would really be better of watching 'Shakespeare in Love' if you want an introduction to Romeo & Juliet that stays true to the text & also has an enjoyable narrative rather than this drivel. The acting was contrived and there was absolutely zero chemistry between the two leads. Also it was very disconcerting watching a 'boy' play Romeo that was prettier than many females I know. If you love Romeo & Juliet, for you own peace of mind, stay away from this aberration. If you enjoy Twilight, this might be for you.",positive
Mother's Day,"I have seriously, never in my entire life, seen something on screen that was this painful to watch (including Jackass and Klovn). Poorly written, poorly executed, unenthusiastic acting from otherwise talented people. Just awful. I feel hurt and betrayed. I want my money back. And my time (finally out of the house, with my fiancé. Great date. NAHT.) From the outrageously racist jokes, the fat jokes, the stereotypical comic reliefs, the utterly pointless scenes and unbelievably unrealistic characters - Just the worst. I expected a pointless, turn-off-your-brain low quality romcom but never did I imagine it being SO BAD. To a few of my favorites acting in this film: Please - PLEASE - have more ambition in the future.",negative
Mother's Day,"I went to see this movie with my wife and we both found it funny and relaxing. You will probably recognize a lot of the situations as the movie is very much in touch with today's social reality and how people cope with it. It's an honest and natural story. Don't expect a heavy-handed drama but a good laugh instead and a surprise here and there. Indeed there are different story lines, in the end they come together and it all makes sense. The duration is OK, we were not bored at all. We feel the many famous actors must have enjoyed themselves while filming. It's of course not the most difficult role they have played in their careers however we appreciated their work a lot and left the theater with happy faces.",positive
Tulip Fever,"'Tulip Fever' transforms a promising idea into Dutch farce as its script heaps unnecessary complications onto a tale of marital infidelity in 17th century Amsterdam. The film opens with beautiful penniless Sophia being married off to a wealthy middle-aged merchant who desires a male heir. After three years have passed and no child has appeared, the merchant commissions a double portrait of himself and his young wife for posterity.When Sophia unwisely falls for the debt-laden artist, everything seems nicely set up for some intense domestic double-dealing, but director Chadwick drowns the narrative in a torrent of subplots. While Sophia cavorts with the artist in his garret, her maid has been dallying with a fishmonger in the scullery. Before too long, the lovers of both mistress and servant are speculating in Holland's tulip-mania bubble to improve their fortunes and romantic prospects. Meanwhile, the two women hatch an implausible plan to deal with their own problems. As the scheming becomes increasingly absurd, the story falls apart and the actors lose faith in their characters. Long before the end, most of the audience will have joined them, as the resolution to all the financial intrigues and amorous chicanery turns the final act into slapstick melodrama.",negative
Tulip Fever,"I almost skipped seeing this movie because of bad reviews, but I am so glad I went anyway. This is really an excellent film. I cannot see for the life of me what the critics (both professional and ordinary moviegoers like myself) are pissing and moaning about. The story moves along quickly, with lots of fun twists and turns and lots of interesting characters who are established early and then return at surprising moments. Lots of good steamy sex too, so stay away if you don't like that. I read reviews about the weak acting—they are all wrong. Judy Dench totally nails her role. It seems I have to relearn this lesson over and over: IGNORE THE CRITICS!",positive
Kill Your Darlings,"Well, how ironic that a film based on the giants of the Beat Generation, the literary revolution that cleaved the 20th Century in half, would collapse under the weight of a badly written, two dimensional, screenplay. There is no shortage of compelling story lines involving the writers who led this revolution; Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Lucien Carr, or William S. Burroughs (murdered his wife playing William Tell with a bow and arrow and got a way with it, oops).The storyline they chose was the murder committed by Lucien Carr where he stabbed and drown a former lover, David Kammerer. There should be plenty to work with here. But rather than focusing the 90 minutes of screen time on developing anything meaningful about the literary movement, the murder, the murderer, or the victim, we're instead shown snapshots of those things, plus Allen's mentally disturbed mother, Lucien's overly involved mother, a prank they commit at the library on the Columbia University campus, Jack Kerouac's complicated personal life, university stuff, other stuff, and then more stuff. The context in which this murder occurs, and the literary revolution, is everywhere, and nowhere. And in the end you could care less about any of them or what they did.I recall hearing a lot about this film while it was in production. The hype was intense because of the real life characters, what they did, and who was playing them. I do not recall the film ever being released. Perhaps it was. But it just seemed to disappear quietly and was forgotten. I saw something about it years later somewhere and thought to myself, ""Oh yeah, that. Wonder what happened to that film."" After purchasing the DVD and watching it, it is easy to see why it was smothered in its crib and buried in the backyard. Which is a shame because the story is there, some of the acting is quite good, but none of that can, or ever will, overcome bad writing. Which was kind of the point of the Beat Generation to begin with. If you can see it for free and have nothing better to do with 90 minutes of your life it won't kill you to watch it. It won't give you any enjoyment either.",negative
Kill Your Darlings,"I had the opportunity to see this movie at the Sundance film festival this year. Absolutely amazing. John Krokidas is a visionary. This is proof that there is an acting life for Daniel Radcliffe after Harry Potter. It is a thrilling and provocative must see. The film flows beautifully and keeps you entranced. This film pushes the limits to new depths that the industry is in desperate need of. I left the film feeling like my mind had been opened to a whole new level. I will watch this movie again and again. But keep in mind it is not for the faint of heart, it is very intense. If you want passion, betrayal, sex, drugs and as rock and roll as the 40's can get, this is your movie.",positive
The Lifeguard,"OK. So this is my first review ever. I had to do this review because I feel like this movie is not getting the well deserved credit it should. I have read reviews that criticize this film for being dull and unoriginal. The thing is, I don't know how people can still criticize films for lack of originality. Newsflash: there aren't original films anymore. Before you watch this film, consider this:The film is only exiting and exhilarating if you know before hand what Statutory Rape is and what are the consequences if you were to engage in this illicit act. In Connecticut, the legal consequence for statutory rape is prison for 10 to 20 years. Here in Florida is even worse. It means to be a registered as a sex offender for the rest of your life and not being able to live within a 3 mile radius of a High School, park or where children play. To find a place like that here in South Florida, you would have to move under a Highway and close to the Everglades swamps. Once you know this. You can appreciate the film a lot more. The film is also criticized for being depressive. To that I say REALLY?? REALLY?? Taxi Driver is one of the most depressive movies you can watch and it is hailed as one of the greatest films ever made.Regarding the film: The bad: 1- The beginning of the film is pointless. It feels rushed. It feels as if it lacked the required budged to shoot a quality introduction. If budget was the problem, I would have not shot the New York scene altogether and would have started the film with Kristen Bell driving away from New York and a V.O. explaining why she had left. The New York scenes were bad.2- The reaction from Little Jason's dad was disappointing. If little Jason's dad would have gone to the authorities, the film would have been a lot more exiting. It also would have shown a bit more concern for the fact that Leigh's actions are unlawful and therefore punishable. I am not saying that films should have moral lessons, but in this particular case, it would have made things a lot more exiting.3- This bring me to the conclusion. If the film would have had a more positive ending, it would have made up for the overall sad tone that everybody is complaining about. I personally feel like Little Jason should have ended up with Leigh. I would have liked Leigh to move to Vermont with Little Jason. The Good:1-Little Jason is very good as a 16 year old with issues. He looks like someone I went to school with. He is easy to relate to. 2-Kristen Bell is very good as the sad 29 year old. 3- The sex scene between Leigh and Little Jason is enough reason to watch the film. Kristen is still hot. Although in this film she is not that hot, but if you watch the film from the beginning, the sex scene is very powerful once it happens. Either way...Watch this film. I strongly recommend it.",negative
The Lifeguard,"Going into this movie, I didn't know much about it. I had seen a few previews in theaters and I had seen it promoted online a few times. Beyond that, I hadn't even thought about this movie. As far as comedy goes, the movie isn't really funny. It has a few ""haha"" scenes but I don't see why they labeled this as a comedy, it has very dark themes such as depression, drugs, and sexual relationships with minors.I didn't know where they were trying to go with the plot. It was undeveloped and shallow. I didn't have any idea what kind of people the characters were even by the end of the movie, there was little to no background on all of the characters. The most comical of all of the characters was the seeming role reversal of two of the characters, you had a control freak husband and all he cares about is starting a family, while all the wife wants to do is go out and have fun. It just doesn't seem like it was practical. The relationships are just off.I will say that Kirsten Bell looks fantastic in a swimsuit. If that's all you care about, you may enjoy the movie. However, if you expect a movie with a decent plot and story, you should probably skip this one. The Lifeguard certainly misses its target as a deep-thought movie.",positive

The Perfect Date,"This impressive piece is so uninteresting, flat, annoying, and offensively stupid I am debating making it my life goal to isolate myself in a cave where no news of terrible Netflix films can ever reach me. Characters are built on simple concepts, and not developed or fleshed out in the slightest. Somehow they lack any motivation at all! Not a single hint of reasonable motivation behind any of their actions! Rather than a story, this film just provides several scenes of disconnected plot points, mildly connected by the same actors appearing on screen and saying things no human being ever reasonably would. In conclusion, don't watch this, the writer should be ashamed, anything else is better.",negative

Prityazhenie,"Since this is a first Russian SiFi movie I watched in this genre, I must say that I am impressed. For the Hollywood SiFi movie lovers, this may not be the perfect match, although visual effects are close in quality. They don't keep you tense for a long duration, there are ""hidden"" messages and human touch in the movie. Its not a John Wayne western type of the movie, like most Hollywood ScFi movies, where you have to kill, die or win on the end for the movie to have some closure. On the bad side of the movie, there are no huge up and down moments in the movie either and ""gang"" (or social) type of violence is on a bit high end for my taste. Some may not like ending itself (Hollywood fans would expect different ending), but from my standpoint it was a very decent ending and still very human.",positive
Drinking Buddies,"I don't normally write reviews for movies but I was so dissatisfied with this one that I thought I'd give it a shot in the hopes of venting some of my feelings and letting go of the abject disappointment that this movie inspired in me.As other reviewers have stated NOTHING happens in this movie. I understand that the director was going for a ""day in the life..."" sort of feel, but still some dramatic something could have been added to spice up the monotony that is these character's lives. Still I probably could have dealt with the cycle of work/flirt/drink/pass out if the characters weren't so absurdly unrealistic. I have no idea what reality the other reviewers on this site live in, but in my world there is no way people would ever behave that way. Workplace romances are common, I have a ""work wife"" just as many others do, but I do not cuddle with her on a regular basis. Nor does she strip down and try to talk me into going skinny dipping with her while my wife is sleeping 50ft away. Then again, I have actual CHEMISTRY with my actual wife and I don't grope my coworkers so maybe things would be different were I in Luke's situation.Essentially that was the problem I had with the movie. The main characters have no chemistry whatsoever with their significant others. Luke barely talks to his wife, puts off any marriage talk and doesn't seem interested in anything she does. He doesn't even care/react in any way when she tells him she's leaving the country for awhile. Nor does he react when he finds out that she hooked up with someone else. There is NOTHING there. Meanwhile Wilde's character (already forgot her name) has nothing in common with her boyfriend, hell she works at a brewery and her BF doesn't even drink beer. There's just no passion in that relationship whatsoever, the sex scene almost made me cringe it was so awkward.If you were unmarried and there was someone out there with whom you shared better conversation, more in common, more similar interests, and more passion than you had with your current partner; would you stay in the relationship? Hell, Luke/Wilde have the same long-term goals for their lives!Add to that the fact that Luke and Wilde have a ridiculous amount of chemistry together and I just can't see a world in which they don't end up if not together then at least both single.",negative
Drinking Buddies,"I am all for horrible movies, but this has to be one of the worst waste of 90 minutes ever put on the big screen. If you watch this movie, you are essentially asked to watch 90 mins of 4 people babbling back and forth about nonsense with some social awkwardness sprinkled in. There was never a climax, and after the resolution of what appeared to be the problem in the character's lives, you are left with a big WTF moment. WTF as in.. Why The F did I just watch this pile of crap? My girlfriend and I were actually counting down the minutes til the movie was over, hoping that something would happen to justify us watching it... Then ......... The movie just ends. So I suppose the good thing about this movie was... It wasn't longer, which would have wasted more of our time. HORRIBLE MOVIE.. DON't waste your time. I'm sure a re-watch of Troll 2 or maybe even Smurfs 2 would be time better spent.",positive
Suite Française,"Now I like a floral frock and a well-pressed Nazi uniform (on screen, you understand) as much as the next gal, but I do find the nostalgic framing of WWII in the movies a little troubling – and 'Suite Francaise' is no exception. The hand of the BBC is everywhere visible in the production, from the costumes to the doughty cast of characters who could have come straight from the set of 'Poldark' or 'Lark Rise to Candleford.Michelle Williams plays 'the beautiful Lucille' (as described by the BBC) and Matthius Schoenaerts gives Ralph Fiennes a run for his money as the brooding, handsome and 'refined' (BBC again) Nazi soldier, his refinement on show for all to see via his wistful tinkling on Michelle's, erm, piano.The two, entirely predictably, fancy the pants off each other (or should that be cami-knickers) and various complications ensue, what with him being a Nazi and everything. But the moral of the story is that lurv and that old-British-chestnut 'common decency' prevail, wresting some kind of happy ending from the film and – by extension – the Nazi occupation of France.The film is based on a recently discovered manuscript. Irène Némirovsky, an ultra-nationalist Russian Jew exiled in France, wrote the stories while living under German occupation. In that context 'Suite Francaise' can perhaps be understood as an attempt to humanise an implacable enemy, the natural desire to have love triumph – at least in the imagination. The real story is remarkable and could have made an interesting film, since Irene Nemirovsky's end was not happy and neither love nor common decency prevailed: like 6 million other European Jews she was ultimately betrayed by the people she lived amongst and sent to Auschwitz, where she died.The unending nostalgia for WWII, envisaged as a time of moral simplicities and endless heroism, airbrushes the reality: that millions of 'ordinary' people in every nation in Europe collaborated with the Germans and shared their distrust and hatred of the Jews, while the wealthy admired the Nazis as a bastion against the political left.When poverty comes through the door, the saying goes, love flies out the window. Ignorant hatred of Muslims, xenophobia and anti-semitism are stalking the streets of Europe once again. We should resist these cosy fables, that reduce WWII to a lush setting for romance, and face up to the less palatable realities of our shared past – which no amount of lipstick can gloss over.For a grittier, more complex, troubling and interesting exploration of similar themes see Louis Malle's 1974 film 'Lacombe Lucien.'",negative
Suite Française,"What a strange feeling it must be to wake up one morning in familiar surroundings where nothing is familiar anymore This film captures what it was like to live under occupation in France during the early months of the war. It is a captivating story about Lucille, a soft- hearted woman played by Michelle Phillips, whose husband is a prisoner of war. She lives with her severe, controlling mother-in-law, played by Kristin Scott Thomas. The two of them are in the middle of collecting rents from their tenants when the war suddenly comes to town. Over the next few months everything these people thought they knew about themselves and each other changes. German officers are billeted out to homes of villagers, some of whom vindictively write letters denouncing neighbours or accuse sympathizers of liaising with Germans. While Lucille discovers the truth about her husband she begins to fall in love with the sensitive German officer who lives under their roof, until the self-centred mayor's wife sets in motion a series of events that rips the town apart.At the end of the film a synopsis about the author is given that is difficult to read -- this film is based on an unfinished manuscript by Irène Némirovsky, a Ukranian Jew who died in Auschwitz. The hand written pages were rediscovered by her daughter in the bottom of a suitcase and published in 2004. This is a tale of everyday people trying to cope in their unrecognizable world. It is both heart wrenching and beautiful to watch. It is also one of the most authentic films I have ever seen of this era. Every aspect of this film's art direction, from costumes and hairstyles to sets and streetscapes captures occupied France in the summer of 1940 better than any film I have ever seen.",positive
The Darkest Minds,Personally I disagree with IMDB's low rating - I really enjoyed this film,negative
The Darkest Minds,"To be honest, I am not sure why lots of people dislike this film. However, I can personally say that I enjoyed this film immensely. Being a fan of the book series, I was already excited for the film's release, but was nervous about the YA novel adaptation. However, I feel that while the book and film are different in many ways (as they have to be, as there are things in the novel that can't be done easily on screen), the production team did a wonderful job of making the film their own, but sticking to the novel very well. Although it seemed fast paced at times, I was eager to see what would happen next. My mom, who has never read the series, left the theater and said ""well, now I'm going to have to steal the second book from you and read it, because I can't wait until another movie to see what happens!""
Please, do not listen to the negative reviews, and go see this film for yourself. I had the incredible opportunity to be a background extra on the set of the film, and saw firsthand how hard both the cast and crew worked to bring this film to life. Please go support to not only see an incredible storyline come to life, but to encourage future YA novel adaptations, female directors, and inclusive/diverse casting.",positive
How I Live Now,"There is some extraordinary sensitivity in Saoirse Ronan that made me watch the trailer that eventually led me to the movie. It is beautifully shot drama. Its dynamics created by the sequence of light and darkness, nature and civilization is so captivating that you are up in it right till the end.The portrayal of a nuclear war is not too light so it is believable, but not too dark so it leaves you hope. The film deals with the great theme of significant vs petty in life which makes you once again to think about what you really care about in this raw nerved life. There is some reaffirming conclusions about the one's will power that can do much greater deal that helping restrain the desire for chocolate,which could've been brought a bit further. But overall it is an interesting movie that asks the right questions, the only right answers being within each and everyone of us.",negative
How I Live Now,"Of all the movies I've seen, this is up there with the best. It's perfect in its variations of tone, from the lyrical to the grisly, and paced so that I never failed to be engaged with it. It avoids being over-elaborate or over-clever.We are drawn in by comedy. Stroppy American teenager Daisy (Saoirse Ronan) flies in to stay with her English cousins and so far as she's concerned, she's landed in Hicksville. They live a carefree, mostly adult-free existence in a ramshackle farmhouse with animals all over the place, unwashed crockery and a casual approach to eating. Just what you want when you've got OCD, food fads and medication. Determined to sulk in her room, she is eventually drawn out and succumbs to the warmth of her cousins, 14-year-old Isaac (Tom Holland), younger sister Piper (Harley Bird) and older brother Edmond (George MacKay}.But in the background there are rumblings, particularly of a nuclear bomb which has been detonated in London. In the foreground, Daisy's and Edmond's hormones are rumbling.The sex scene, when it comes, is how it should be done: lovely without being too explicit, too long or salacious. That's followed by soldiers arriving, guns blazing, to impose martial law. Boys and girls are split up to be taken to separate camps, but Edmond and Daisy vow to be reunited. Daisy's escape is a grim survival scenario in which she has to practically force-march Piper to exhaustion through a landscape beset with dangers, particularly for vulnerable females of any age. Who will survive? The acting? Well, there's acting, good acting and acting so good that you forget that it's acting, and Ronan's and Bird's acting both come into this last category. I was totally absorbed in their journey. It's very, very rare for me to lose my sense of detachment when I'm watching a film but I did here. Few people have doubted Ronan's ability since her impressive performance as the 13-year-old Briony Tallis in Atonement. However, I've sometimes felt that she has been the victim of a misguided director (Peter Jackson in The Lovely Bones) or a substandard screenplay (The Host). I've often wondered when she would get more material worthy of her talent. Well, boy, has she hit the jackpot this time. Director Kevin Macdonald did everything he had to do to get the story across without any of those irritating ""look what a wonderful director I am"" flourishes. People will inevitably draw comparisons with Meg Rosoff's novel, which I haven't read, or other films in this ""genre"". How I detest the pretentious overuse of that word. This film was enough for me and if you don't think it measures up to your precious novel or your precious genre that's your problem, not mine.",positive
Some Kind of Beautiful,"""You can leave me, but I am not leaving that boy."" Richard (Brosnan) is a college professor who teaches the classics and has a young and beautiful wife. When he finds out she is leaving him his life is shattered. He throws everything into his son and trying to get a new job. Things get complicated when he starts to notice Olivia (Hayek) in a different way and a problem with his Visa comes up. Now Richard must try to get a job, stay in the country, and find love with someone he never expected to. Judging by the synopsis you may think this sounds like a cookie cutter movie, and your right. The movie is pretty predictable and not original but it is funny and very watchable. Pierce Brosnan is a great choice for this and he really saves the movie from being something overly generic. There really isn't a whole lot to say about this since there has been a million movies with this same idea but even so this is still a good movie and defiantly worth a watch. I did like it but I am also a big Pierce Brosnan fan. Overall, nothing original but entertaining and funny. Worth seeing at least once. I give this a B.",negative

The Book of Life,"Review: This is an average movie about 2 best friends who both love the same girl and fight to prove who is worthy of her love. One is a famous bull fighter, who really wants to be a musician and the other is a highly decorated soldier who protects his village from evil. There are some other elements to the storyline which makes it quite interesting but the animation looked weird, especially the characters with the weird noses which looked more like snouts. Personally, I think that the storyline is a bit too confusing for kids and the songs weren't that great. I did enjoy all of the scenes with Ice Cube but most of the movie was corny and it seemed a bit messy. On the plus side, the kids will like the vibrant colours and the love story between Manolo and Maria but I was expecting more from this film. Average!Round-Up: Although I didn't think that this movie was that great, it did make a healthy profit at the box office, mainly because it's a fun day out for the family. I couldn't really tell who was Chaning Tatum but Ice Cube and Ron Perlman was blatantly obvious. The animation looked a bit blocky but the attention to detail was quite impressive. As the film had a Mexican flavour, I think the director missed the chance to have a great soundtrack. Anyway, it's not an all time classic like Frozen, which did rely a lot on the soundtrack, but it's harmless fun for the whole family. Budget: $50million Worldwide Gross: $97.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation movies about 2 best friends who are fighting against each other to impress there true love. 4/10",negative
The Book of Life,"First lets; clarify; I am not Mexican nor any in my family and friend group; however it has been a long long time since we catch kids movie able to captivate 5,6,7 or 8 year old girls and boy and the parents that took them. Just the quality, colors and artistry of the images; makes the movie worth; but the subject matter is even more impressive. How many times you were able to really laugh on a subject matter like death and make children (and adults) happy with an adventure that is pure entertainment but also gives a quite poetic look at life and dead. In brief; take your children to see it as an excuse; you probably will enjoy it even more. Forget PIXAR formula products; this is just a masterpiece",positive
We Are Your Friends,"Let me start out by saying I love EDM. I've spent my entire life(as far back as I can remember) loving techno, house, dance, drum and bass etc etc. my first techno experience and first tape I ever owned was the Mortal Kombat soundtrack! Yes you laugh but forget that it's mortal kombat and listen to it. THE best techno of the time!This movie was not about edm. It was not about the experience of a rave or festival. Which honestly isn't what annoyed me. I could've really enjoyed a compelling story told within the world and culture of electronic music.My problem with this ridiculous movie is that it is nothing more than an 80's coming of age story Cliché. Ahh yes kids, sit back as we watch the white male and his white male friends as they experience growing pains, have minor set backs, get the girl and of course win the day all while looking like an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog circa 2001.Though I thoroughly understand that Hollywood will learn nothing from this bomb of a movie I do need to applaud my peers for not bothering with this joke of a film. As hard as it tried to appeal to what Hollywood believes we are..drunken, Instagram obsessed degenerates..okay we kinda are but we don't need to see it on the big screen! Even with all that..we still know crap when it's trying to be forced fed to us! HENCE We Are Your Friends: 1.8 million gross.Should you see it. Why I do believe I've answered that.",negative
We Are Your Friends,"I loved this movie. I thought it was so inspiring. Maybe I'm in a place in my life where I need some serious hope, but I got it from this movie. It was worth renting for a few reasons but two of the biggest reasons are these two quotations:1. ""This is the best part, the best part of anything really, it's the moment before it starts."" That one line is riddled with anticipation & hope. Just great.2. ""and if it's real enough, honest enough, & if it's made of everything that's made you, where you come from, who you knew, your history, then you may have a chance at connecting with everyone else & maybe that's your ticket to everything.""gives me chills.I honestly watch very few movies where lines, ideas, or overall messages stick with me but this one did in such a positive way. It's all about growing up, working hard, struggling, making mistakes, but picking yourself back up & with all your grit making something of yourself. It's an age old concept but the way they did it stuck with me. The movie was shot beautifully & although I'm not into this kind of music or the lifestyle shown the filmmakers did a good job guiding me through it & connecting it to the overall concept so it can be universally applied to any kind of lifestyle or career choice. And you can't take your eyes off of Efron. Yes he's a dreamboat but he is mesmerizing in this. You root for this beautifully imperfect character just making it happen for himself. Zac - never stop taking interesting roles. You were truly great in this & are hugely talented. I laughed, I cried, & overall just loved the movie. I will be watching this again when I need to be inspired & reminded of the beauty that can come from hard work & pure soul.",positive
Labor Day,"'Labor Day' begins in a broken American household. After his parents' divorce, a sensitive seventh-grader chooses to stay with his depressed mother rather than join his father's new family. Henry and Adele remain trapped in a sad, dysfunctional relationship as a child parenting a traumatized adult until they embark on a fateful shopping trip prior to a holiday weekend. They are accosted in a discount store by a threatening stranger, Frank, who demands they give him a ride in their car, and accompanies them to their dilapidated rural home. By the next morning it's apparent he's a dangerous escaped convict, and his departure has become impossible since a police dragnet has surrounded the area.After this disturbing first act, the film soon leaves 'Desperate Hours/Straw Dogs' territory in the rear view mirror and enters a sunlit world similar to 'The Bridges of Madison County'. Frank confounds pessimistic expectations by coaching Henry in baseball skills, doing various household odd-jobs, servicing the car and baking peach pies. Before too long he's also healing Adele's aching loneliness with his peachy massage techniques. Fine performances from the three lead actors hold the film together, but can't prevent the story's drift into sentimentality and implausibility. The epilogue stretches any remaining credulity beyond belief as it panders to the feel-good requirements of a rich box-office harvest.",negative
Labor Day,"The movie Labor Day stars Kate Winslet, Gattlin Griffith, and Josh Brolin. When I saw this film yesterday, I was lucky enough to have the director, Jason Reitman, get up on stage and introduce the movie. He made it clear that this film was not a comedy, but a romantic drama that he made with tons of passion. For what it is, I think the film is amazing. I will warn you, this is a film was made for women, but guys can appreciate it too.So this movie was fun to watch. There was a lot of tension, and the actors did a good job of making even the unbelievable situations seem natural. There was a mystery that unfolded over the course of the movie, and the film was able to create real emotion and genuine shock from the audience. There is also great cinematography, nice subplots, and a final quarter that keeps you guessing. I'm not exaggerating any of this, so seriously ignore the critics and give this film a chance.The main thing that is wrong with the film is a certain level of disbelief, but it doesn't require more suspension of disbelief than any of the big blockbuster movies. It could also get cheesy and a little uncomfortable to watch at times, but it is still a great movie. i hope Jason Reitman continues to make great movies, as he has not made a single misstep in his career yet.This is a good movie to take a girl to on a date, and I'm sure you both could enjoy it. It is a little like a Nicolas Sparks book except with Oscar level acting, directing, cinematography, and screen writing, so if that sounds like your kind of thing, I highly recommend this movie, and reward it with an 8.7/10 stars.",positive
A Little Chaos,"By just looking at the cast, I shouldn't be surprised that this movie is good. But I was surprised. It was more than good. It was mesmerizing.I am compelled to get something out of the way first. The period piece is set at a period of Louis XIV when France was enjoying power and prosperity and the polarization of rich and poor had not yet developed to the point, a century later, of catastrophic meltdown. Still, to enjoy this movie, one needs to avoid adopting a judgmental stance of condemning the outrageous extravagance of royalty, but focus on the appreciation of beauty and art and the admiration of the protagonist, a female architect by the name of Sabine De Barra, so brilliantly portrayed by Kate Winslet.Without belaboring the details, I'll just report that the simple plot surrounds Louis XIV's (Alan Rickman) wish to have created something of an esthetic perfection in the form of gardens in the lavish Palace of Versailles. One crucial component is an open-air, circular ball room that is complete with auditorium seats and running fountains. Against all odds, Sabine wins this job by impressing the King's trusted master-builder Andre Le Notre (Matthias Schoenaerts) with her design that subscribes to the theory of having a little chaos (hence the title) rather than complete, rigid order. While Le Notre disagrees with her theory, he has the vision and capacity to accept into the project ""a voice different from his own"". Development of romance is predictable, as are dramatic conflicts and crisis.Winslet is pitch-perfect as a woman with talent and passion for her profession that was all but male-dominated. There is also the more subtle, but fully palpable side of vulnerability which Winslet projects almost effortlessly. Belgian actor Schoenaerts would have impressed you, if you have seen him in ""Rust and bone"" (2012) providing solid support to Marion Cotillard in her impeccable performance as a women who just lost her legs in an accident. In addition to directing, Rickman also played a key character, giving the reason that since set construction for this movie was so expensive, saving the salaries of one key character would help to ease the budget. Whether you consider that jest or not, his portrayal of Louise XIV is immensely successful in shaping this character into someone almost lovable. Stanley Tucci does the usual Stanley Tucci thing, lighting up the screen with his flamboyant portrayal of a charismatic nobleman. In a small role of one of the woman at the King's court is one who is among my top favorite, Jennifer Ehle. While she has produced an abundance of excellent work over the years, she'll always be remembered from ""Possession"" (2002) as Christabel LaMotte who, incidentally, is in the same predicament as Sabine De Barra, a talented woman in a male-dominated society.Cinematography, art direction and music all contribute to making this movie such a pleasure to watch.If I have one criticism, it would be the somewhat contriving mysterious background of Sabine who is known to be a widow but with very little other information. It is obvious though that she is trying very hard to block certain excruciatingly painful memories, with little success. It is also obvious that this baggage was becoming an almost insurmountable obstacle in the development of a more intimate relationship between her and La Notre. The mystery, eventually when revealed, is neither earth-shattering nor emotionally compelling. The way it is dragged out like a suspense mystery is quite unnecessary, to say the least.",negative
A Little Chaos,"Went to the movie with low expectations, thanks to some of the comments having written here. What I met was something spectacular. Very cleverly organized script had become a a most beautifully shot film in the hands of Alan Rickman. A strongly developing romance, beautifully acted scenes from the very beginning to the end, obviously a result of the touches by the director. Rickman should direct more films. Very passionately recommended to those who love details in words, minimalism in acting. To me, it is a collection piece. Also, The star of the film, Kate Winslet, once again, shows why she is of a great talent. Every moment she is on the screen, her powerful acting capacity flows like a very big river that nothing can possibly stop.",positive
The One I Love,"If you go past the overall poor acting and flat dialogues, you get to a plot that might turn interesting. It actually managed to get me excited for a few minute, even if it was after a very long bored waiting for the pain to go. The characters are overly understanding, OK and chill with the whole situation. They even ask for more. You get so little attached to any of the characters that whatever happens is of little interest to you. Annoyment is also apparently the most they can feel and you would be probably less shocked by their behavior if they were teenagers, not a married couple. Some queues by the DP on his way to shoot the movie give away a part of the plot, luckily it's has no point in the end, as most other queues to a deeper meaning. In the end you get a poor Peter Pan story, a few nice shots (if you like trees and lens flare...) and the most expected, uninspired and badly brought over end you could find to this story. All this in the most convoluted package you could think off... It's sad, it was very close to a pretty good plot for a RomCom, but it doesn't get there. You end up wondering why they even bothered to make things so complicated... Bad enough to motivate my first written review on IMDb!",negative
The One I Love,"It's hard to relay the joy I felt watching The One I Love, Charlie McDowell's first full-length feature. It's the kind of film you'll remember for a long time because it breaks so many boundaries. It's the kind of film Spike Jonze might come up with, minus some of the academic pretensions he sometimes clings to.The trailer for The One I Love is almost perfect. It doesn't spoil the premise of the film, and neither will I.Mark Duplass (who also produced along with his bro, of course) and Elizabeth Moss are excellently cast as Ethan and Sophie, two not-so-newlyweds who are encountering all too typical problems ""relating.""At the suggestion of their therapist (Ted Danson, in a just-right cameo) they spend a weekend at a rather large rental house, unsuspecting of the lengths their counselor is willing to go to in order to motivate them to ""connect."" The One I Love is a high-wire act by anyone's standards. The script is especially brilliant, but it doesn't spit its brilliance in your face constantly and then ask for your approval with laughter or the occasional tear. Instead, it dabbles in elements of Sci-Fi and Fantasy but doesn't let the main characters (or the audience) off easily by subjugating the human story to questions of logistics. In other words, this isn't a movie for the compulsively left-brained and anal. The performances and plot are engaging enough to make you accept this often absurd but always engaging film for what it is.It takes guts to break the rules, even more talent to make it work. With The One I Love, Charlie McDowell seems destined to reprove the adage that talent runs in the family.",positive
The Skeleton Twins,"This movie is such a mash-up of mainstream indie film clichés that it almost plays like a spoof of Sundance dramedies. You know the kind I mean: a dysfunctional, cynical group of individuals is forced to spend time together and end up reconnecting with each other and, after lots of wisecracking, '80s music interludes, and moments of forced poignancy -- regain their humanity. But if it were a spoof, it would be entertaining. The fact that it premiered at Sundance says a lot about the current state of independent cinema. The only satisfaction one can get from watching THE SKELETON TWINS is keeping a checklist of indie film conventions that this movie recycles -- from overall themes, to plot devices, to performance style, to wacky musical interlude. If you've never seen an independent film, you might be impressed by the self-consciously quirky direction, the quote-unquote dark comedy, the lovable gay character (we know he's gay because he tells us so, several times, in the first ten minutes). I wish the filmmaker had spent more time developing three-dimensional characters instead of taking other people's shortcuts.",negative
The Skeleton Twins,"The Skeleton Twins tells the story of two estranged twins, Maggie and Milo and the hardships that come with their lives. To start off, this film is one of the best films of the year, hands down. Bill Hader and Kristin Wigg prove that they are not only talented comedic actors but excellent actors all around. Coming off of their Saturday Night Live days, this film is proof that these two have more to offer than sketch comedy. The story, while dark and dreary, still manages to score some great laughs. Despite a huge theme being suicide and the reasoning behind why one would take their own life, it manages to keep the material light but still packs some heavy emotional punches in certain scenes. A film that can balance something as serious as suicide while still making you laugh is an accomplishment in its own right, in my opinion. There is only so much I can say about the story without giving too much away, but I will say that it is as close to perfect as a film can get. The actors are stellar all around the board, made up of Wigg, Hader, Luke Wilson and Ty Burrel, this cast is utterly fantastic. Luke Wilson steals the show in scenes with Hader but what Hader does with his character is takes something very two dimensional on paper and transforms it into something provocative and sharp, it would not surprise me if an Oscar nomination comes his way for this. Kristin Wigg is on point as Maggie, commanding the screen with the perfect balance of comedic sharpness and dramatic pull. She is a marvel in this film and should also get some sort of recognition for this. Overall, I cannot praise this film enough. It is sharp, witty, dramatic, funny and heart warming. It is the feel good movie that you'll walk out of and want to see it again as soon as possible.",positive

Pride,"Probably few things have divided the British people more in the last forty years than Margaret Thatcher's time as Conservative leader.

Arthur Scargill led the miners in a fight to the death against pit closures and their way of life; Maggie Thatcher led the government and establishment that could never afford to lose that battle. Britain would have been a very very different place if history's dice had fallen differently.It would make a great movie. But ""Pride"" isn't it.Whilst based on a surprising true story and whilst the politics of the strike forms the backdrop to the story, politics itself doesn't really rear its head in the film (other than the rather one-sided perspective of the miners that they were 'right' and the Thatcher and police in general were 'evil'). Instead, this is really a study of the enormous prejudice and real physical danger faced by the gay and lesbian community in London and the country in general.George MacKay (""Sunshine on Leith"") plays ""Bromley"" (real name Joe) – a 20-year old (so therefore under-age at the time) who is a closet gay. He lives a normal suburban middle-class life with his unsuspecting parents whilst also supporting the LGSM ('Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners') action group. This is led by Mark Ashton (Ben Schnetzer, ""The Book Thief""), who drives forward the goal of raising financial aid for the striking miners' families. Helping him are his assorted friends including gay couple Jonathan and Gethin (Dominic West and the brilliant Andrew – ""Moriaty"" – Scott), Mike (Joseph Gilgun), Jeff (Freddie Fox) and Steph (Faye Marsay ""I'm the 'L' in LGSM!"").The irony is that the miners are generally speaking the most homophobic group that they could ever hope to find, so the union wants nothing to do with them or their money. Through necessity, the group focuses on one small Welsh village and on turning the community (their attitude that is!) to accept them and their gifts. Even this reduced scope proves to be an uphill struggle.Whilst this is first and foremost a 'comedy drama', a menacing presence in the film is the AIDS virus: this was a time before retroviruses, when being diagnosed HIV-positive was a short and dark path to the graveside. Yet at a time when thousands were dying of the disease, Jonathan has the alternative moniker of ""Number 2"" – the second person in the country to be diagnosed as HIV-positive but mysteriously still alive.The film is a tour de force of British acting talent. In particular (give or take the odd dodgy accent) the characters who make up the Welsh community are all superb: Paddy Considine (""Hot Fuzz"", ""The Bourne Ultimatum"") plays the open and reasonable envoy first sent to London to meet LGSM; Bill Nighy in a quiet and understated performance (yes, you heard me right) plays Cliff; Imelda Staunton plays the hilarious role of Hefina, leader of the committee group; Jessica Gunning is pitch-perfect as Sian – a tea lady with a feisty attitude and Maureen (Lisa Palfrey) is a delightfully unlikable homophobic miner's wife who stokes trouble with contemptuous glee. Finally, a good share of the comic lines go to the marvelous Menna Trussler as the bespectacled old dear Gwen.Both MacKay and Schnetzer head up the younger end of the cast admirably: I was very rude about Schnetzer's performance in my ""Book Thief"" review, but he is a revelation in this film. Andrew Scott is as magnetic as always, and Dominic West shines as the nearest to Simon Callow's memorable ""Four Wedding's"" character that we've seen, swapping ""Bloody Brigadoon"" Scottish dancing for lively disco-led moves.Matthew Warchus, better known as a Broadway director and a relative stranger to the film set, directs with verve and style. The comic timing delivered through the final edit is very sharp. And the pathos and tragedy is handled very sensitively but very powerfully: there were a number of ladies in the cinema I saw who were in floods of tears when the lights came up. (Also, as a further warning for tissue supplies to take into the cinema, if like me you have a Welsh other half then the combination of panoramic Welsh landscapes and (very moving) close harmony singing will trigger severe homeland-sickness: you can take the girl out of Wales, but ).This film came close to perfect. But I had a few issues with the (generally excellent) script by Stephen Beresford. The reason for Mark's dramatic change of heart in the middle of the film was rather poorly explained (if explained at all). And was it me or did one of Maureen's rabidly homophobic sons do a U-turn in appearing with the other miners at the (remarkably, historically correct) gay pride march at the end of the film? If so, this seems to be an unnecessary and Hollywood-style candy-coating too far.Above all, for me this is a film that both highlights how far we have come in thirty years in the area of gay rights and perhaps how far there still is to go. As a particularly touching example, seeing how difficult it was for the teenage Joe to come out to his parents in 1985 made me realise it is probably almost as hard today as it was then. Whilst levels of both expectation and acceptance are higher today, it is still a hard conversation to have ""Perhaps you'd like me to take you to the cinema to see a film Mum and Dad?"".(If you enjoyed this review, please see my other reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and sign up to ""Follow the Fad"".

Pride,"I have just watched this film and on a personal level it affected me greatly. I was a young gay man in 1984 and I and friends, travelled to both the 84 and 85 Pride marches in London. I remember the Miners support at the 85 and we were greatly touched at the time. The movie got the details exactly right, I and many of my gay friends were on lots of marches including the ones against Clause 28 the evil Tory piece of legislation that outlawed promotion of homosexuality in schools and publicly funded museums and art gallerias (among others).What I want to say about this film is that young gay and straight people should see it. It is immensely moving and funny. Just the right balance. I wept throughout and laughed because it brought to life my youth as I lived it in protest against that evil woman and her kind who dared to tell us how to live our lives, and who we couldn't legally love. It was scary times, AIDS, homophobia and arrest for protest.I probably can't be objective because of my involvement as a youth in gay protest, it brought raw emotions to recall how angry we young people were then. But more importantly for me it reminded me like it was only yesterday of the immense Pride we felt at fighting for our rights and anyone who was a victim of hatred and prejudice.All of the actors were a delight, and the portrayal of working class solidarity spot on and very emotional. I loved the fact that it had that British humour that is so peculiar to this country. The details were very true to the time, I recognised the clothes, the music and how tatty gay clubs were with peeling paint on the walls. It is a film that brings to life a time that has not been portrayed before, of protest, solidarity and how together we can change things.I'm glad that such a film can be made and successful in this country now as a mainstream film as well. Maybe that shows that the protest of our youth changed things. I can get married now if I wish and thanks to a Tory PM, who'd have thought it? So one big thank you to all involved for making this 50 something gay man remember so vividly, and in spite of the dark days portrayed, our youthful struggle and reminding us that we really did something wonderful and change things, as this film is proof positive that we did just by the fact that is got made.I hope that young gay people, who still cope with the same problems we did, isolated, alone, and scared can watch this film and gain strength from it and join the fight against prejudice still to be won.",positive
Belle,"Enjoyed it first when I watched the drama. After reading up on the true history later, I was a bit disappointed to see what a far cry the movie is from historical reality.Yes Lord Chief Justice Mansfield, Dido Elizabeth Belle as a mixed-race aristocrat, and John Davinier did exist in history. The problem is Lord Mansfield was a brave key figure in the Abolitionist Movement in his own right instead of a 'reluctant' reformer as portrayed in the movie!The true Dido in history was not only beautiful, but also well-versed in law and politics. She acted as Lord Mansfield's legal secretary inside the Kenwood residence...Unfortunately due to her mixed-race, she was never given the option to marry a man of equal nobility and intellect. She only married after Lord Mansfield, both her mentor and protector died. She did become Mrs. Davidier, but her husband was a French servant instead of an aspiring, abolitionist lawyer in the movie.If Dido lived in modern days, she would have become an highly accomplished barrister or Chief Justice herself. Instead she married someone who could hardly be her intellectual equal. She became home-maker with three children and died young in her early 40s.",negative
Belle,"I just saw an advance screening of BELLE--and I absolutely loved it. The dialog, directing, performances, costumes, locations, and cinematography were all fabulous. It's based on the mesmerizing and romantic true story of the beautiful, intelligent, mixed race daughter of an admiral, who was raised in Georgian England by her aristocratic great-uncle and his wife. The script hits all the right notes as Belle struggles to find her place in a society that doesn't quite accept her, and with the help of an idealistic young vicar's son (Sam Reid-- fantastic), influences an important anti-slavery case. Congratulations to director Amma Asante and writer Misan Sagay for bringing this story vividly to life on the screen. Gugu Mbatha-Raw was luminous as Dido Belle, and I think Tom Wilkinson gave the best role of his career. Both are Oscar-worthy performances. The film is highly recommended.",positive
Een man die Ove heet,"The movie doesn't do the book justice. I believe the adaption could have been done a lot better. The movie leaves out a lot of crucial scenes that explain why the main character behaves the way he does. The script is also plagued with a problem that is common in Swedish movies. The fact that the dialogue becomes too theatrical and not ringing true.Generally I felt that the acting was sub par. This is somewhat related to the problem with the dialogue; you feel like you're watching actors rather than characters. However, Bahar Pars, Ida Engvoll and Rolf Lassgård were the exceptions. They all did a pretty good job in my opinion. However, although I felt the movie lacking in a lot of areas, the story is pretty good. But I recommend reading the book before seeing the movie, as the book, in my humble opinion, is a lot better.",negative
Een man die Ove heet,"This movie is about an old man that appears to be grumpy. The story gradually reveals his back-story in a masterful way to explain his behaviour that will probably change your opinion of the main character.I can honestly say that I have never before felt such a strong connection to a character in a movie. This is an absolute masterpiece. The directing of the movie is also great. It's easy to understand who is who and when a flashback occurs even if you have not read the book. The greatness of the movie will be most appreciated if you understand Swedish, but even if you depend on subtitles it will still be a gem that you should not miss out on.I am very conservative with rating movies 10/10, but this one I think truly deserves it!",positive
Zoolander 2,"i loved Zoolander, thought it was witty and funny, but Zoolander 2 was just rubbish. its just like Owen Wilson and Ben stiller decided to top up there bank balances with this unfunny boring movie.i lost an hour and a half of my life which ill never get back,i would have rather sat in a dentist chair getting my teeth pulled out. Same old jokes nothing original it relied too much on cameo appearances.its a shame because i was looking forward to this movie for the past 15 years. its just like Wilson and stiller didn't have any chemistry together,I've seen some horrible comedies in my life and i can honestly say this was the worst I've ever seen. all i hope is they don't go and make a third one. P.S If you really want to see this movie, wait till its on DVD.don't waste your money going to the cinema, you will regret it..",negative
Zoolander 2,"I am going to just say, Derek Zoolander & Hansel's first movie was dynamite stuff, really classic and really quite funny. It was always a cool time to pop in my VHS tape with some popcorn and stuff. So when I saw that they had made the second sequel movie film to the first movie that was made, you can bet I was super excited and pumped for it.Well, rightly so, what a film movie! It was perfect. It wasn't recycled at all, it was still just Derek and Hansel being really cool guys and stuff. I was sorry to hear about Derek and his stuff that he had going on, I didn't know it was such a rough time off the runway and stuff, you know, but thats real life, it can sometimes be not the place you ever want to end up ever. It can make you die. So anyway, the scripting was fantastic, and the plot was just great. The cameos were all just fabulously wonderful and absolutely sexy. rawr, folks.All in all, I adored it. And I'm fantastically happy no one else does, because I can have it all to myself, just like the first one. Hah. Suck on that, critics. You just don't get the grown up's humor. Humph. I need a roasted butterscotch latte.Ciao",positive
Admission,"Okay, like some reviewers here, I watched Admission expecting a comedy, the kind Tina Fey and Paul Rudd usually are associated with but unlike some of them, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it was more of a drama than a rom-com. I also liked Lily Tomlin's performance as Ms. Fey's mother especially when she's initially on screen. Actually, Ms. Fey is quite hilarious whenever she emphasizes her sad emotions for her benefit like when she's talking to her colleague-and rival for the dean's job-about her emotions. There's quite a lot of good scenes of both humor and drama abounding here. Really, all I'll say now is that I very much enjoyed watching Admission and I wouldn't mind seeing it again some other time in the future.",negative
Admission,"For those of you who are thinking that this film is a comedy, you would be wrong. It is more of a drama with some funny moments thrown in (although I never laughed out loud; not even once). As a matter of fact, by the time the film was over I was actually feeling a little sad. The story centers on an admissions officer for Princeton University, Portia Nathan (Tina Fey) who is responsible for combing through thousands of submission requests and evaluating who should be allowed to attend this prestigious school. On top of that, the current dean of admissions is retiring and Portia and her rival Corinne (Gloria Reuben) are both up for the job. Gearing up for her annual recruiting trip, Portia is contacted by John Pressman (Paul Rudd) to come and check out his somewhat fundamental and ""earthy"" school. Upon arrival John tells Portia that he thinks that one of the kids in his school is actually the child that she gave up for adoption when she was in college. Jeremiah (Nat Wolff) has been a slacker most of his life, but it turns out that he is a natural genius and was just bored in school most of the time. He gets very interested in attending Princeton and so the story begins. The film started out mildly comical, but as the story went along it became more and more serious. The two characters that did add a little light-heartedness to the film were Susannah (Lily Tomlin) who is Portia's mother and an eccentric soul. She is not much into relationships of any kind whether it is a mother/daughter or a romantic relationship. The other character that I really liked was Nelson (Travaris Meeks-Spear) who is John's adopted son who is just looking to be normal and to not go gallivanting around the globe all the time with his father. I think the cast as a whole did a really good job and the story was not boring, but I think that billing it as a comedy was the wrong way to go. The story was a lot more serious than I expected it to be, so I think that as word gets out, this film may not do as well as expected. It was not a bad film, but I am not sure that it is worth the price of a ticket. I am giving this film an amber light.",positive

To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You,"There has always been a difficulty in writing sequels to teen rom-coms because what makes or breaks a franchise is the chemistry between the two romantic leads. The first film is one of the best ever written as both characters have fun and believable without falling into boring or problematic tropes.The main problem with this movie is that it has a every mixed bag of explanations for things in the first movie that really did not need to be revisited. A good example is when Jen reveals that she confines in Peter because their parents were both separated - which is a good subversion. What most completely ruined this movie for me is how it seemed to forget how much of an b**** this character was in the origin and up to this point. Yet all the blame falls onto LJ for doubting Peter and assuming they were cheating. There is a strong balance between blame in the first movie between LJ and Peter, however all the blame is tipped onto LJ here because she 'overthought' everything.The worst scene is when LJ learns that Peter asked Jen down to the hot tub, intially it seems like they were going to explore the idea of fate more with who he might have ended up with. Yet this is retconned later on when she apologises to Peter and Jen for blaming him then Peter has to wait whilst she re-evaluates and they get back together: sound familar? The last third of this movie is a rehash of the exact arc she when through in the last movie YET Peter does not learn anything. Instead of following through on the idea of her accepting responsibility for """"""over-reacting"""""", they backdown and have him stay with her out of love (beginning to feel like co-dependence). Not consquences. No depth.This is not mentioning the worst part of this movie. John Ambrose. A generic and unnecessary point of conflict made retroactively worse by the improvement on Jen because we know they can write good romantic rivals.Remember when I praised the first movie for not falling into problematic tropes? Either way you look at his it a) places all blame on the women or b) is a reversal of the they have to be together because they 'love' each other.This movie did not need to exist.",positive
The Exception,"The Exception works a good premise into a rollicking spy-romance that, once it hits its stride, delivers on both the suspense and the action. In that sense, it's an old-fashioned movie - one that hooks you in, stays just a step ahead and doesn't out-stay its welcome. Christopher Plummer gives a bravura performance as the former Kaiser. Janet McTeer is typically excellent as his wife. And the two young leads are attractive, in and out of their clothes, if no threat to Streep and DeNiro. Okay, so the story doesn't entirely accord with historical fact. Yes, Wilhelm never quite gave up on a restoration of the monarchy. Yes, Hermine actively petitioned the Nazi's on his behalf. But that's about where it ends. In truth, Wilhelm was as much an anti-semite as the Nazis. And the Nazis thought him an old fool, not worth bothering with. Still, it's worth the suspension of disbelief for the duration of the movie.",negative
The Exception,"The Exception (2016) was directed by David Leveaux. The movie was produced in Belgium, but the dialog is in English. The film is not meant to be a documentary, so we can't take it at face value. However, the basic outline of the story is true. Kaiser Wilhelm II was forced to relinquish his throne after World War I. He spent his remaining years at a secluded mansion in Holland. When Holland was invaded and conquered by the Germans, Wilhelm came under the direct authority of Germany. In the movie, a previously wounded German army captain (Stefan Brandt, portrayed by Jai Courtney) is sent to be the commanding officer of the Kaiser's guard. Brandt is a loyal officer, but he is disgusted by the SS atrocities. He falls in love with one of the maids, Mieke de Jong, portrayed by the beautiful Lily James. She is Jewish, but Brandt isn't anti-Semitic, so he pursues his romance with Mieke.Historically, Heinrich Himmler, the Reichsführer of the SS, did, indeed, visit the Kaiser in Holland. That visit is the lynchpin to the plot. (If the visit had been invented for plot purposes, we wouldn't believe it. However, Himmler really did visit.)The key role in the film is that of Kaiser Wilhelm II, played brilliantly by Christopher Plummer. Plummer is a consummate actor, and he makes the role come alive. I think that the manner in which the Kaiser is portrayed takes the movie the furthest away from historical reality. In the film he's shown as a more-or-less kindly old man who loves to feed his ducks. According to Wikipedia, he remained a harsh, haughty aristocrat. However, the movie will only work if we believe that the Kaiser also has a softer side, so that's what we see.I want to alert IMDb readers to watch for the work of Janet McTeer, who portrays the Kaiser's wife, Princess Hermine. She has no great love for the Nazis, but she is willing to go to any lengths to see that her husband returns to Germany and is restored to his monarchy. She is a German Lady Macbeth--cold, calculating, and decisive. We saw this film at the wonderful Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It will work well on the small screen. The movie carries an anemic 6.8 IMDb rating. It's much, much better than that. The plot is interesting, the acting is outstanding, and the direction is excellent. Don't be fooled by the low rating--this is a movie that I highly recommend.",positive
Equals,"This is SUCH a tired theme... sterile emotionless future society, yet two people are different, fall in love, and fight the system... When George Orwell did it in ""1984"" it was still reasonably fresh, but that was almost 70 years ago.""Equals"" stars Nicholas Hoult (the creepy kid from ""About a Boy"" grown up, and even creepier) and Kristen Stewart (known catatonic) really have no chemistry and the movie gives them no reason to be together except they're both ""different."" Watching on DVD, I saw a lot of visual ""banding"" issues, and the audio was largely, well, inaudible. And this universe is all touchscreens and barcode scanners that constantly ping and whoo, which becomes really grating even 10 minutes in... ick.Instead of this, I'd suggest ""Gattaca"" -- http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119177/ -- That was 20 years ago, and the premise was already getting threadbare by then, but at least there are some interesting stakes and twists and performances from Jude Law, Alan Arkin, Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke.Or maybe ""The Island"" -- http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399201/ -- yes, Michael Bay, so plenty o' 'splosions, but at least it's a decent premise and has lots of good twists.Even good old ""Logan's Run"" -- http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074812/ -- handles this material in a more interesting manner -- it's pretty cheesy in terms of effects and costumes (it was 40 years ago so cut it some slack), but much more fun.The commentary on the disc tries to position the film as some great love story that just happens to be set in this cliché future, but there's almost nothing there. Skip it, or at least lower your expectations.",negative
Equals,"I don't think this film deserves the bad reviews it is receiving. Of course everyone has different opinions on a great film. Personally, a movie is good (or great or excellent) if it sticks with me for a while after. I found myself thinking about the main characters for a few days after watching it at the Toronto International Film Festival. This film made me feel many emotions for the characters -which is very ironic considering the main theme of Equals. I thought Kristen Stewart and Nicholas Hoult had excellent chemistry and portrayed their characters so wonderfully, and that's an impressive accomplishment if you remember the characters for the most part are supposed to be emotionless.",positive
The Old Man & the Gun,"Those of you who are Robert Redford fans - you won't be disappointed. Those of you who aren't Robert Redford fans - you won't be missing a whole lot.Like a lot of RR movies - it's a kinda, sorta entertaining film about a kinda, sorta interesting real-life event - in this case a career criminal who kept robbing banks into his 70s.Like a lot of Redford films, it's a comedy-drama. Sort of.Will you laugh out loud, cry, or even become particularly emotionally invested in the film at any time? Probably not, whether you're a Redford fan or not.Will you like it? That definitively depends on whether you're a Redford fan. If you are, you will walk away feeling you watched a movie that - while not particularly exciting or funny - is nonetheless a worthwhile effort as an artistic venture. If you're not into Redford - you will find it pretentious and slow with a somewhat inflated opinion of its own self-importance.",negative
The Old Man & the Gun,"When have you ever been able to sit back and watch a man commit a crime with a smile on his face and not even feel remotely bad for the people he is victimizing? Personally, I always watch heist movies and feel bad for the victims, regardless of how truly endangered they are. If your leading man or lady has good intentions, then it becomes easier to watch, but I've never quite had an experience like The Old Man and the Gun before. This is a film that takes its time telling the story at hand and there's hardly ever an exciting moment, but it never feels like it drags. This is (surprisingly) a true story that I believe everyone will get a kick out of and here's why.Following Forrest Tucker (Robert Redford) after he has escaped from prison, The Old Man and the Gun is really just about a man who doesn't have many years left in his life and simply wishes to do what makes him happy. Robbing banks in the most polite way that he possibly can, without ever harming anyone, and pretty much always getting away with it, the character of Forrest is absolutely perfect for the way this film portrays him. Whether he's in a high-speed chase to the sound of a calm country song or sitting in a diner with a woman whom he's trying to form a connection with, this is truly one of the most relaxing experiences I think I've ever had at the movies in quite some time.Robert Redford has always been a likable screen presence. Since his early days in movies like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid to even small roles in films like Pete's Dragon today, he has always had the charisma to charm his audience. This may very well be his final performance and if that's really the case, I believe he has gone out on a very high note. I don't believe this film isn't going to win any awards or really be nominated for all that much, but in terms of purely enjoying a character on-screen, The Old Man and the Gun delivers on everything you'd expect, and then some.Yes, as I said, this is a very calm film, so what's a calm experience without the much-needed elements. For a movie like this, you'd expect a slow score and music that will put you at ease, along with some solid comedy in the moments where he may be going a little too far for his particular characteristics. The film provides all of that and more. There were moments where I felt he was about to go out of character, but then the film either came up with a joke to make you feel comfortable about his choices or played a country song that was so on the nose that it makes you laugh. For as slow as this film is, it never once had me checking my watch. This 90-minute film flies by, even with its slow pace.In the end, The Old Man and the Gun is the type of film that's very hard to find a complaint about. It has a specific direction and it sticks with it throughout its entire duration. It's about a wanted gentleman who goes under the radar and robs banks, finds love and is continuously hunted by the police (namely a cop played by Casey Affleck, who is also extremely enjoyable in the movie). Look, if you're looking for a complex cops and robbers story, then I would look elsewhere, but if you just want to relax at the movies and have a good time, this is the perfect film for exactly that. The Old Man and the Gun comes highly recommended from me.",positive
The Space Between Us,"Is there anything more infuriating than people who know nothing about science trying to make a film/write a book about science? It seems like they didn't have a single person on board who knew anything about ANYTHING. I'm not even a scientist and I could have come up with a dozen ways to work around all these ""issues"" that were driving the story onward.This film is a plot hole after another plot hole, the most infuriating part being that the whole story didn't need to happen.!!!!!Here come the spoilers!!!!!!:1. There's no way the mother would have passed the health checks while being pregnant. They're pretty thorough. Not only that, she appeared to be a good 5+ months pregnant when the mission started - absolutely no way in hell no one would have realised (even discounting the vigorous health checks).2. WTF did they feed the newborn baby? The mother died, and I presume no one thought to pack baby formula for the astronauts to drink.3. They could have brought the child back when the mission was due to return. First of all, 2/3 gravity isn't a big enough difference to even on its own to cause irreparable damage. I'm certain they could have helped get his body used to a higher gravity by exercising him and making him wear weights or something. Even without all that, they could have simply helped his body and his heart adjust to Earth's high gravity by for example putting him in a freaking water tank, idk. There are ways.4. He (Gardner) has instantaneous communication with earth, and access to the internet (and presumably everything it has to offer), he's apparently a genius, and he was indeed raised among humans - even if they were only ""scientists"", rather than ""loving parents"" who would teach him all about life - yet somehow half the time he's acting like a socially retarded 5-year-old who has never seen even a picture of horse?! Uh-huh. This whole person-from-a-different-time-or-space-is- overwhelmed-by-the-present thing has been done a million times before; it's an old joke, and this time they failed massively.5. Even though he's now old he could have still done the physical therapy I mentioned earlier. Better late than never!6. I love how in the beginning of the film they make a point to mention that Earth's resources are pretty much depleted and all that jazz, but then 16 years later they can afford to send a rocket to space just to send a Martian and his father back home. You know how many resources it takes to build a rocket and fuel it? Even if the rocket was part of a mission that was already going there (conveniently leaving so soon after Gardner nearly died), those seats are valuable, and there are no spares.Alas, that's not even all of it, but those are the biggest, most glaring plot holes that drove me nuts due to the fact that they rendered the whole film pointless.And all this is ignoring the generally poor story line, shallow character design, crappy writing, and mediocre acting. Ugh.",negative
The Space Between Us,"Some of the reviews I have read must have come from those without a beating heart. I finally took the time to watch this film as the reviews were not great. I had an understanding it was a little sci-fi and a lot teenage love story going in. I found the screenplay to be brilliant by such young actors. I also understand there should be some fantastic things in a movie that includes sci-fi so while some of what the teenage couple set out to do seems unrealistic, it fits for what story the director and writer were trying to give us. I wish more adults could express the feelings this movie tries to tell us not to hide, and to enjoy every moment of life that is afforded to us. I found this movie not only heart warming but uplifting and inspiring. Thank you for such a much need film of this type. It has been a while. Take the fantastical with a grain of salt and pay attention to what it is trying to share, we may just all benefit from that thought process rather than the cynical one.",positive
Kaze tachinu,"I'm going to pull out all the stops as I'm trying to verbalize how mightily impressed I am with ""Kaze tachinu"" (2013), or ""The Wind Rises"". Miyazaki has now been at the top of his game for well over thirty years, and his latest and apparently last film is remarkable in all the usual modi operandi – luxuriant use and understanding of colour, extraordinary level of detail in even the most mundane-seeming particulars that make the scenes come to life, fantastical sense of the relationship between dreams and imagination and reality, and how the story stems from the images and extends to the world of the creator, and ours. The film tells the story of Horikoshi Jiro, a genius whose enthusing search for perfection makes him descend the dream-path laid down in his youth. A story of determination, the film is also a profound meditation on the forces of nature: Tokyo destroyed in the earthquake and by fire, the aircraft in shreds and pieces. The influence and inspiration given to Jiro by what only he seems to be able to see around him makes him the visionary that he is. Airplanes, trains, ships, radiators. The path to advance technology, first by exposure, then by imagination and invention. To be either Achilles, twenty years behind, or the tortoise. Filmmaking is very much the same: seeing the unseen, imagining that which has not been imagined. This is not compromise or pampering to the lowest common denominator, but art that goes all the way beyond our wildest dreams and is still able to describe the indescribable so lucidly we become enraptured and immediately converted.All the Miyazakis I've seen have some incredulously indelible moments without compare. Here there are several, including the utterly beautiful dreams, especially the wind, the opening five minutes in full, the remarkable sound design during the dreams and the earthquake, the water, the rain, and the flight.And speak of the wind! It has personality, it's brilliant and as powerful as in ""Ran"" (1985), ""Zerkalo"" (1975) or ""The Wind"" (1928), in some ways even more so because it's animated in ways impossible to achieve in live action. And the love that uncharacteristically seems to evade and elude, as it does in Wong Kar-Wai's ""Fa yeung nin wa"" (2000). She paints, and the picturesque mise en scène and the atmosphere is comparable to ""Van Gogh"" (1991) and its languorous lushness. Then there's Thomas Mann's ""The Magic Mountain"" used by Castorp as an allegory for forgetting, yet the novel becomes real through Nahoko's illness and not as a token of forgetting but instead of never forgetting.And then there's the war. ""It flies like a dream"", the pilot says, thanking Jiro during the apparent climax of the film, and Miyazaki cuts to a scene of utter destruction, a cemetery of people, ideals, ideas and technology, a disaster not unlike the earthquake in the beginning, yet so tragically unlike.The name of the film comes from a quotation from Paul Valéry, but refers to Ghibli: the name of the studio but also the engine of the aircraft in ""Porco Rosso"" (1992). It's a real engine used in an Italian aircraft during World War II, designed by the Caproni seen in the film. In a way, then, this is as natural a conclusion to Miyazaki's career as one could imagine: a flight of imagination, carried by the most powerful wind, and a shared dream of great minds that we are lucky to be invited in.",negative
Kaze tachinu,"The announcement of this film was a pleasant surprise after Ponyo and From Up on Poppy Hill, which both had simple, childish plots. Few films in Japan have tackled the lives of imperial period heroes; the ghosts of the 1960s urge people to denounce what really happened in that time and memorialize an imaginary anti-war movement, for example in this year's film ""Shounen H"". For Miyazaki to choose a subject like this showed that he was really going for a huge challenge. Miyazaki is of course anti-war and environmentalist. But Ghibli films are never negative. What sort of positive image of the Zero bomber inventor would Miyazaki produce?The result is astounding. As everyone has noted, this is not a children's movie. It's complex, so it doesn't have the epic sense of Miyazaki at his best, but history and adulthood are just as complex, and Miyazaki does justice to both. The film indeed stays positive throughout, by showing from start to finish how everyone wishes they themselves would behave, rewarding the viewer with virtue and beauty, but without being condescending about the hardships of real life. In a sense, the film is about the ""importance of dreams"", but it's also about what it means to be a dreamer in real life, and how our highest fantasies can be turned into beauty if we put our minds to it. The cartoon medium is put to full, extravagant use in dream sequences that merge right into the narrative. Certain elements at the end of the film leave the obvious unsaid in a peculiarly Japanese and fulfilling way. The most classic films of Japan, like the great works of Akira Kurosawa and Yasujiro Ozu, say something profound about the meaning of life, and Kaze Tachinu deserves a place among those ranks.",positive
Jeune et jolie,"Before anyone gets a wrong idea that I am not a fan of French cinema, I have to say that I am quite the opposite, and it is with that state of mind that I approached this film. I really wanted to like it, and was willing to forgive many small and even some bigger mistakes.
But, when an entire film is based on an unbelievable premise due to lack of motivation (and clear presence of repulsion toward such!), and when everything that follows is portrayed with distinct sense of repulsion, all of it wrapped up in a poor story, and even poorer observation of characters, there is really not much to celebrate here. The only reason I give this film three stars is Marine Vatch who was absolutely superb in her understated performance. Other than that, most everything was disappointing, from start to finish.
The story could have been interesting if it better written. However, as it is, there is nothing to root for, nothing to discover, nothing to gain from watching what amounts to ""watching the paint dry"". It is slow, bordering with boring all the time, and the worst of all - empty. Devoid of any real emotion, good or bad. It is ennui at its worst.
The ending missed a great opportunity for redemption, the middle part missed a great opportunity for some introspection, and the beginning missed a decent setup - as to why is the she doing the stuff she is doing... unless, of course, all you are after is a typical middle aged men's wet fantasy of a teenage girl who loves to get in bed with them.
It appears that ""Jeune and Jollie"" is a thinly veiled attempt at selling us some sex as ""deep and understated"". It is neither deep nor understated, it is simply shallow and pointless. And yes, Marine is gorgeous, dressed or naked. I prefer her dressed as those other scenes were done in such poor taste I had to look away (literally).
Not recommended at all, except as an insight into how quickly French cinema is failing.",negative
Jeune et jolie,"A young and beautiful girl sells her body to rich older men, lying about her age, and hiding it to her parents and friends. Until an unexpected event forces her to confront reality. The new film's subject from French director François Ozon is close to Julia Leigh's 2011 ""Sleeping Beauty"", but the treatment is quite different. Nothing is odd or strange here. We follow Isabelle's journey through the discovery of sexuality in a very realistic fashion, typical of Ozon's filmmaking.The only trouble is that we are not troubled ! The script is so predictable that we get very few surprises throughout the film, and we do not care for Isabelle's fate at all. That's a shame considering the interesting subject.The lack of explanation for her behavior is a good thing, we do not get the usual psychological/environment/parents syndrome, but this leads to a certain shallowness.Actors do a fine number, especially the beautiful Marine Vacth, whom we should see again very soon, hopefully in a more rewarding role.",positive
Spring,"Have you ever seen a movie that is at the same time romantic drama, comedy, sci-fi and a horror movie with some historical elements? Spring is not a drama with other genre *elements*. This movie is at the same time all of the above. Now that's a crazy combination! Spring takes things slowly. It is not fast paced horror movie primarily focused on delivering terror and creeps. Scary scenes are nicely distributed through the whole movie. In between them we enjoy romantic moments. Historical elements play a really important role in delivering the last few key moments. I found this movie pretty funny. Comedy is not by itself obvious (even though the main premise is pretty hilarious when you think about it); those having a peculiar sense of humor will surely appreciate ""hidden"" humor. Just look at a few quotes on IMDb page.When I first had seen the movie I gave it a six. Now I give it an eight. This is one of the most original screen pieces I've ever seen. Different genres are balanced very finely.Spring is going to disturb you, make you laugh and most importantly make you think about what gives life a meaning. Is it really important how long one lives? And the final scene? It gives meaning to the whole movie and provokes answers to existential questions. Just wait till you see it!",negative
Spring,"A hidden gem and easily one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The acting, writing and directing are all seamless.I admit there were moments, such as when our poor protagonist reacts to the truth about his girlfriend, which stretched the bounds of plausibility, but aside from those few scenes the film was incredibly real and fresh throughout.The film's brand of dry, intelligent humor was a lovely surprise. I buckled in for a thriller and found myself laughing many times instead. I also highly commend the snippets of philosophy, morality, mortality, religion and science which were sprinkled throughout the film and delivered with just the right amount of wit and depth by both actors. It really is a wonderful blend of romance and sci-fi, and this is coming from someone who loves sci-fi and has a pathological fear of chick flicks. I highly recommend it.",positive
By the Sea,"By the Sea is a voyeuristic portrait of a couple fighting for meaning, sanity, connection after something traumatic happened and took away the flow and the beauty they once had. They are trying to deal with the situation the best way they can, yet keep failing over and over again. Can the beauty be rescued, can they again find the trust they once had, underneath all the pain and disappointment?It takes some time to sink into the rhythm of this movie, since it follows the pace of a real human life, rather than a pace of a popcorn flick. And I applaud Angelina for her courage to stick with this rhythm and create an experience of melancholy and expression that has become quite rare nowadays, and quickly discouraged by the prevailing hunger for fast-paced download of entertaining stimuli.The photography is beautiful, both Brad and Angelina superb in their roles, and I really liked the montage that is respecting the viewers and letting them put the pieces together. I am sad to see the average user rating here, guessing the ratings would have been way higher had the raters not known who the director was.One day after watching it I still feel mesmerized by the atmosphere of the movie.",negative
By the Sea,"The story lacks substance and moves so very slowly. Or perhaps because there is no story -nothing happens and it seems to take place slowly. Watching Jolie play dress up and lie in bed feeling morose and popping pills is boring. And as the dialogue is vacuous there really is not much good to say about this film. The setting is very beautiful!We see an alcoholic husband and a depressed wife sitting in a hotel, by the beach and in a café or restaurant. They sleep. She walks. He drinks. And he tries to write. She cries. They fight. The action is pedestrian. The conflict is unexplained and weak. The film plays out like a spoiled wealthy white couple who have nothing to do by the sea so they drink, take pills and fight and sleep. Nothing happens and what does happen looks like it was written to provide Jolie with opportunities to pose: sitting, standing, looking. This is a film about the troubles people have when they have no troubles.I like Bradd Pitt and Angelina Jolie but they should have paid a good writer to do their acting skills and chemistry justice. This film comes off as an attempt at copying a 70's artsy Euro style film. It was painful to look at and I am not surprised. Why some actors think that because they can act that they will automatically be good at something else is nothing new.",positive

Endless Love,"I have a decent range when it comes to film viewing, but I don't enjoy romance. Firstly, they're unrealistic and secondly, you can usually tell what will happen. So, Endless Love is a love story. Cue alarm bells. But it gets worse. The awful trailer makes it look like just another bland love story. Except it's not. This is a romance between Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde. Think of that and tremble. There are 2 big questions here: 1. The original Endless Love movie was apparently awful, so why remake it? 2. How can a film be called Endless Love, consist primarily of its 2 leads gazing into each other's eyes, be full of romantic montages and love scenes and have a script which is overloaded with romantic sayings yet feel less romantic, moving and emotional than The Texas Chainsaw Massacre? To be fair, it is what you'd expect from a film like this and there is a bit of humour which is appreciated but aside from that this is a two dimensional and aggressively bland movie that is one of the worst in a strong year for films.The acting is laughably bad from the 2 leads. Alex Pettyfer is that bland kid who made Alex Rider (The super cool boy spy from the Alex Rider books) as bland as a shopping mannequin. Gabriella Wilde is that model who murdered the character of Sue Snell in last year's Carrie remake. Together, they have no chemistry and no emotional investment whatsoever. The direction is utterly nauseating as the film plays like an extended romantic music video and the script is utterly devoid of any kind of spark or charisma. Endless Love will appeal to its audience, but it is one of the blandest movies in recent memory and so full of clichés (I feel like I've seen all these things hundreds of times before and I don't watch this kind of film a lot) you'll forget in 24 hours. To add insult to injury, they actually put family issues and bereavement drama into this pathetic love story which feels out of place and irritating. Endless Love is so boring it passes too quickly to do any real harm, but you've seen the whole film just by watching the trailer.2/10",negative
Endless Love,"Love lost and love found are some of the most rewarding narratives we have ever seen on the big screen. In David Elliot's (Alex Pettyfer) case, love lost, as his therapist tells him, is ""like a book you read long ago"", and those words could not be more true for Endless Love. Aside from being a remake of Brooke Sheilds' 1981 film of the same name, the film is also an exercise to see how Shakespeare's famous tragedy, written almost 420 years ago, could be modernized, interpreted and adapted for a Pinterest-driven, Instagram-obsessed generation of young people. But like the amaro, hudson and mayfair filters featured on the highly addictive mobile app, Endless Love is a sun kissed love story told through the lens of a writer/director that is beautiful to look at, and understands what it's audience wants, especially during one of the most forcefully romantic times of the year. No movie released on or around Valentine's Day should be judged on originality, because like the holiday itself, there is nothing original about roses, chocolates, and forced sentiment that is the driving force flooding people's minds. Instead, writer/director Shana Feste delivers an entertaining, nicely shot film of first love with many of the essential ingredients to make it a success amongst young people.One minute, hopping along the roofs of cars, the other, kissing the girl of your dreams, Endless Love is a soft and safe story of two lovers who find themselves on opposite ends of the tracks of life. David, who has been in love with Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde) since tenth grade, uses their high school graduation as a chance to finally connect with her. The wonderfully innocent and vibrantly blonde Jade, who has spent the last two years of high school mourning the death of her older brother Chris Butterfield (Patrick Johnson), decides to spend most of her free time submerged in literature and within the tall gates of her family's large estate. Grieving from the loss of their child, Hugh and Anne Butterfield (Bruce Greenwood and Joely Richardson) are content with having their two remaining children sheltered at home. It isn't until Jade's graduation that the lives of the Butterfield's are completely sent topsy-turvy by David, a smart and sophisticated young man whose main concerns are his father and his attainment of true love.The 1981 version of the film is a dark and often times melodramatic adaptation of Scott Spencer's novel of the same name. David's character and the past that haunts him in the two earlier adaptations are much darker and convoluted, often times resulting in mental institution. But in Feste's interpretation, the real conflict in the film is the one between Jade's overprotective father Hugh, and David. This conflict in the film is the driving force for so many of the characters and is one that shows the intentions of a young and impressionable boy, against the expectations of a worrisome and overbearing father.Hugh, a cardiologist, after having his prized son pass away, looks to keep his family tradition alive through his to-be doctor daughter, especially since his middle son Keith (Rhys Wakefield of The Purge), is intent at keeping his father at arms length; falling in love and studying on his own terms. Greenwood's performance of Hugh is one that has many layers; on the one side, a protective father who keeps his daughter from making a decision that might jeopardized her life and future; and on the other side is a haughty, upper class elite who doesn't see David as able to provide the kind of lifestyle his daughter deserves. Greenwood becomes the essence of the film, showing that true love doesn't always reign supreme and providing the film with a conflicted character with realistic and somewhat expected mid-life crises.The truth remains, there is a big difference between true love and first love. David, who scores an impeccable SAT score and professes to finding happiness in simplicity, spends his days after high school helping his father Harry Elliot (Robert Patrick) around the auto shop he owns. Throughout Endless Love we are reminded just how smart and wise David is, yet the choices he makes, and a little bad luck, get the better of him. Showing very brief glimpses of anger that often finds his fist connecting with several people throughout the film, David gives merit to Hugh's concerns for his daughter. But, like any good cranky dad set amidst any love story, love reigns over logic. Decisions are made during the course of heart-wrenching monologues, and tempers escalate quickly, but not before any Valentine's Day film's centre motto is expressed, and that's letting the past go.Greenwood's character Hugh may be a bit manipulative, controlling and dramatic with his actions towards David, but there is no doubt that Hugh faces so many of the concerns of fathers whose daughters tread off the path they set for them. Endless Love is a very melodramatic yet manipulative descent into social classes and how it affects young people in love, but throughout the film, there are hints of truth and reality.Overall the film is a success thanks to it's talented actors in front of the camera. From Richardson, a mother who knows the power of love, to Wakefield who gives an accurate, rebellious truth to the neglected middle child, the performances in Endless Love are as good as can be. Dayo Okeniyi, who gives a reminiscent Derek Luke like performance in the film, gives the film much of its humour and heart, standing beside his best friend and star-crossed lover David. Aside from the lovers, the film is held together by it's patriarch Greenwood, on and off screen.Check out the full review at www.nightfilmreviews.com",positive
Victoria,"I don't want to summarise the plot too much, if at all, because I think this is the sort of movie you should go into a bit clueless - BUT, what can you expect is an amazing, edge-of-your seat thriller, beautiful cinematography, and great acting.Here in the UK we miss out on ever hearing about most European movies like this one, smaller budget with unknown actors. But this one is getting a little attention for it's 'one-take' concept, in that the entire movie really was shot in one take. It's one hell of a feat, considering the intense action scenes included, but they pull it off wonderfully. It gives the feeling of being along for the ride, and personally kept my attention gripped for the entire movie.The titular character Victoria is a complicated girl, and you are given but tidbits of information as the story goes on, never quite a complete picture but a sense of her emotions, and her reasoning for the pertinent decisions she makes throughout the story. The other actors are also all excellent, much of the dialogue was improvised and it felt very natural to me, capturing the difficulties between speakers of different languages perfectly. The main criticism I have seen on this site is that the audience didn't understand why Victoria made certain decisions in the film (again don't want to give anything away) - but I don't understand how that's a problem. Enough was revealed on the journey that with some empathy (assuming IMDb reviewers do have some) I could easily imagine Victoria's mindset, even if I wouldn't have done the same as her - the movie is not about me! Sorry that's my rant over.I rated it a 9 because visually it was beautiful in a very simple way, it was not at all predictable, and it had me questioning my own decisions afterwards - which is what I look for in a movie.",negative
Victoria,"When I saw the trailer of Victoria I was really interested in the movie, because I am a fan of Sebastian Schipper, who directed also ""Absolute Giganten"", one of the best German movies in recent years. German cinema had to struggle in the last years, too many movies about the German past or really bad and soulless comedies flooded the market. Only really few risks were taken and some of them were pretty good E.g. ""Zeit der Kannibalen"", but for the most part they sucked. So...there comes Victoria, a movie by a experienced director, with (for the most part) unknown faces in the cast, a really small crew and shot in a single take in a night in Berlin. Latter is something truly unconventional for a German film, so I went into the theater expecting a good unconventional German movie. What I got was a masterpiece. Victoria is not only the best German movie in years, but (IMHO) the best movie of the year yet. The tracking shot in the movie isn't only there for effect and a showcase of the cinematographers talent, but a essential part of the films main story, that unfolds around a Spanish girl named Victoria, that meets a bunch of ""real Berlin guys"", so they call themselves, in the middle of the night. You experience the story of Victoria in real time, you see live character development for instance.That, the down to earth acting and plot make the movie so incredibly immersive that it becomes something completely new and fresh, which is incredibly rare in recent years. I don't want to give away more about the plot, so I'll talk about the acting. The acting in this movie is fantastic, the dialogue is actually completely improvised, so that the actors, especially the fantastic Laia Costa and Frederick Lau, become these characters in those 140 minutes and it feels real. It feels like they are actual existing persons.The cinematography is brilliant, Sturla Brandth Grøvlen does a fantastic job in accompanying the main characters and even if there are some shaky parts, which was expected, its never annoying and the viewer becomes the camera. Another aspect of this movie that I adored was the soundtrack. It was perfectly suited in supporting the atmosphere and hypnotic. I left the theater speechless, what happens in the final act will either throw you off, or you will be completely exhilarated. Either way: Watch this movie and support movies with original concepts, only like this we will continue to get better movies than the usual dog**** from Hollywood and co.Victoria is a truly exhilarating masterpiece and the first time I felt like watching a new kind of cinema in a long time. Go and watch it. Its worth it.",positive
The Discovery,"When the scientist Thomas Harbor (Robert Redford) proves the existence of afterlife, there is a massive wave of suicides on Earth. On the second anniversary of his discovery, his estranged son Will (Jason Segel) travels on a ferry to the island where his father lives. He meets Isla (Rooney Mara), a troubled woman that lost her five-year son, and they have a conversation; then they say goodbye to each other on the arrival. Will's brother Toby (Jesse Plemons) drives him to Thomas's real estate, indeed a colony for troubled people that attempted to suicide. Thomas discloses that he has developed a machine to record what dead people see in the afterlife. When Will walks on the beach, he sees Isla trying to commit suicide, but he saves and brings Isla to his father's house. Soon they fall in love for each other and Will shows her that his father's machine works. But when Isla is murdered by an insane resident, Will uses the machine expecting to meet her in the afterlife. Will he be well succeeded? ""The Discovery"" is a romance with an original story and a missed opportunity of making a great film. The performances are top-notch but the screenplay is messy and boring. The idea of spiritual planes in the afterlife and the consequences of the scientific discovery of the afterlife is fascinating and deserved a better screenplay. The final twist is totally unexpected. My vote is five.Title (Brazil):"" The Discovery""",negative
The Discovery,"The movie starts off with an intriguing premise, the scientific discovery of the afterlife. Good cast, should be a decent story... what could go wrong? Well, I guess a lot could.Nice seeing Redford in a film, some of the supporting cast is fine, but Mara seems miscast, and her 'leading man' has the personality of a house plant. Zero chemistry between them, and at no point do you really find their romance believable. It's difficult to figure out why the filmmakers basically decided to make the film into a love story between such boring characters when the simple premise of the film is much more interesting. Mara apparently can play just one type of character, which we see in every single film she is in -- the sullen girl. And she's paired up with the least curious, least interesting, scientist in the world. Will (her love interest) seems to sleepwalk through the movie with a pained looked on his face, like he has a nail in his shoe or he simply doesn't want to be in the film.Meanwhile they have Redford, supposedly the most important discovery in the history of humanity, and they end up with a looping love story more reminiscent of Sisyphus than anything else.Anyway, the science of course is hokum, but there are several large plot holes. Like giant gaping craters. Afterlife proved incontrovertibly would seem to imply peer review and other scientists being involved. Then why does the film act like Redford's character alone can do this research? Why do they pretend like if he hides his findings it will even matter? Surely someone else in the World is doing this same research.Instead of tackling the subject head on, the film veers off into little adventures, like finding a corpse -- which of course is a great opportunity for our lovebirds to bond.After a weak middle, the film takes a turn into stupid, with our previously never-curious scientist doing the death dance himself. This results in a final explanation of how the afterlife works ... which feels like the film ran out of ideas and wanted to wrap things up real quick.Personally I would have preferred they simply went with the idea that the research was flawed, humans look for meaning and patterns where there are none, and that Redford's character was responsible for millions of deaths. Not exactly a crowd-pleasing ending, but it's better than what they came up with.",positive
Beast,"The first part of the film sets up a tense atmosphere by keeping the main characters under a mysterious light. It appears that something great is about to be revealed. But as the time passes, it is clear that this movie wants to be something it is not. There are no surprises, no shock value, and no unexpected turns. The actors do their best to save the underwhelming narrative, but they can only do so much.Beast feels like an overproduced student film that doesn't have anything new to offer.",negative
Beast,"In an isolated community, a rebellious and troubled young woman finds herself torn between her manipulative family and the allure of love between her and a roguish outsider. At the height of a terror of serial killings that have swept the small island, this young woman's lover is accused as a suspect, sending her and the town into a frenzy.""Do you think he saw it at our cinema and was inspired?"" says the creepy former cinema operator in Zodiac when talking about 1932 horror classic The Most Dangerous Game. I asked a similar question about this film. But while it has loose inspirations from The Most Dangerous Game, it is its own beast, with some nods here and there to the horror classic. Ultimately it is a warped yet insightful comment on relationships and our animalistic brains.It's clear to see the focus to details in script, character and dialogue. The film takes great care in layering the film with on the nose suggestions to animalistic themes. We slowly see the descent of Moll from her oppressive civilised institution to her barbaric earthy hidden self. The Institutional oppression or lack of success is a key theme for many horror films and so too does Beast echo this with its choir symphonies and the ruthless attitude of the police force. There is a character that is brought in as part of the police investigation that exemplifies both but twists the motif on its head and the alluring love life with a suspected serial killer humorously seems to be the saner side. It's the anxiety around trusted institutions of social circles, the police force and family being morphed into these Gothic Horror-esque characters, that bring a spine-tingling tension. However, the focus of the story makes polar shifts and makes the tone quite uneven in parts. Sometimes venturing more into a dramatic romantic tale, with very little detail into the investigation/murders that adds a lack of story to that part of the film.That is not to say it forgets what it is, quite the opposite, the heated passion of these two lovers is constantly smeared with an uncompromising pressure. Words and glances seem to echo as you question their meaning, this is made insurmountable by the staggeringly possessive performance from Jessie Buckley. A deeply complex and often outright absolutely confusing portrayal but ultimately an all-encompassing character that will have you hanging off her every word. Johnny Flynn plays his part in contrast, reserved, secretive and less showy but still just as powerful if not for a few dry deliveries here and there. This film really belongs to the two of them, adding an uncertain nature to their relationship and the outcome of events, they are integral to keeping the plot as nail-biting as it is.While much of these characters and the story itself breaths an air of predictability, the film does a marvellous job keeping you on your toes. Echoing the anxious, erratic characters, so too does its plot possess these qualities. Shifting between passionate warped romance and gothic horror murder mystery can be quite unsettling but evidently, that is the desired effect. Sharp, direct and yet subtle, Beast controls its audience and characters with a haunting clarity and while it's ending seems somewhat rushed and flat it still bears interest and discussion. Making Beast an absolutely exhilarating primal rush from start to finish, an astonishing directorial debut.",positive
Beautiful Creatures,"As a die-hard fan of the Beautiful Creatures series, this movie was completely and totally horrible, and almost painful to watch. The movie was basically a Twilight-ified version of the books I loved. From the complete absence of key characters (Marian, the Sisters, Reece, Mr. Wate) to the ridiculous additions to the plot line (Ethan forgetting Lena) and the major events and character aspects left out (Ridleys lollipop, Larkin being Light, Macon being a Caster, Link killing Ethan, and don't get me started about Genevieve killing Ethan!), this movie was horrible. I understand that the director and the screenwriter were allowed to take some liberties with the script, and some parts of the book were just impossible to adapt into a movie, but this 'interpretation' was awful. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, even someone I deeply disliked. I was close to getting up and leaving the theater.",negative

Song to Song,"My God I am all here for a great experimental, artistic movie, but this was just boring. Despite all the great cinematography, the message from this movie could be told in 30 minutes and was explored so much better in another 100 movies. The scene with Holly Hunter in the parking lot was the best one, but it only lasted a few seconds. Besides that, it was just an accumulation of beautiful faces flerting together (good acting nonetheless). And where was the music? The music could have saved the movie. Filming the film at a festival and putting on some old music legends doesn't do the job.",negative
Song to Song,"I'm giving this film a 4/10 and that's honestly being quite generous. I'll start with the good parts. The acting is quite solid all around and the characters feel believable and real, the only downside is that it sometimes feels a bit too improvised. With a cast this great how could you go wrong?Well it turns out you can go really wrong. The whole movie feels very pretentious and it tries so hard to be deep and philosophical. Sadly it delivers on no parts of that spectrum and ends up just being slow and boring. There are a few interesting parts of the movie, mainly those with music and real artists, but the rest is just unbearable. One upside is that the cinematography is on point most of the time so we see a few beautiful and interesting shots here and there.I've studied film and I try to always give movies a chance but this was honestly painful. It felt like this movie could easily have been one and a half hours shorter. I understand wanting to keep a slow pace and take time with the storytelling but that requires that the story and characters are at least interesting or engaging. Not worth your time and money. Unless you're into being extremely bored.",positive
Colonia,"If one were to judge ""Colonia"" purely on face value, it would be an average film. It jumps around a bit, doesn't have a clear narrative, and doesn't really even have all that much resolution. When you consider that it is based on true events, however, it needs to be judged in that capacity. With that in mind, ""Colonia"" becomes a much more experience considering they had to keep somewhat on track with the real life events.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Lena (Emma Watson) & Daniel (Daniel Bruhl), two young adults who happen to get caught up in General Pinochet's military coup of Chile (both were protesting against that very action). Daniel is sent away to some sort of cultish camp (Colonia Dignidad) which is led by the brutal and enigmatic Paul Schafer (Michael Nyqvist). Lena volunteers for the women's section of the cult/camp, experiencing similar horrors of her own in order to track Daniel down and hope to come up with an escape plan.Probably the biggest ""knock"" I'd have on this film is that parts of it really don't make sense (and really don't even try to). In film-making convention, that is kind of a no-no. You never really understand the motivations behind some of the characters or the things that happen.At the same time, though, that is a large part of why this movie can be quite effective when looked through a different lens...that of reality. One of the characters, a fellow cult member to Lena, utters a quote along the lines of ""don't try to make sense of this place...you never will"". That's what the viewer has to do when watching this movie, too. Instead of dissecting it, this is one of those movies where you just have to sit back and allow yourself to think ""this was actually a real place"". Once you see what happened inside the walls of the cult, that thought alone will make you shudder.It helps, of course, that the acting is mostly spot-on. Watson is perfect, as usual (it's too bad she is taking a bit of a sabbatical these days, as her work is always stellar), and Schafer's character is legitimately creepy. Plus, there is just an air of weirdness and mystery surrounding the entire project that gives it a great sense of foreboding and tension.Overall, I enjoyed watching ""Colonia"" as much for its uniqueness and ""true story"" nature (especially one I had never heard of before) as anything else. Like I said, if you critique it on ""script cohesiveness"" alone it might come up lacking, but once you let the gravitas of its real-life events sink in I think it will move you to care about the characters and their situations.",negative
Colonia,"Stumbled across this title. Looked interesting. Gave it a shot and was pleased with what I watched. Not knowing a single thing about the movie or the real history behind it, I went into this thinking it was going to be about something totally different. I was even surprised when at the beginning I saw the name ""Emma Watson"". I knew good things were gonna happen. So as it unfolded, I thought it was gonna be some political thriller where the boyfriend gets kidnapped by the army goons and then he has to escape. Imagine my surprise when it took a turn to Chilean/Deutschland Jonestown!!! Didn't see that coming! The old hag nazi b!tch was excellent. You just knew right away that you wanted her to get clubbed over the head with a blunt object. Thanks Emma for granting my wish. I didn't care for the love story, but it drove the film. Anyhow, I don't want to give anything away, just suffice to say - this is worth your time watching!",positive
"Juliet, Naked","This film is so simple and intelligent. Ethan Hawke is brilliant both as an actor and a real musician. He performs both roles beautifully. Rose Byrne is never less than perfect. This film has so much heart in a way that is understated and not pretentious in any way. Beautiful scenery, plus a great soundtrack that includes Ethan Hawke doing a fantastic cover of The Kinks Waterloo Sunset along with some great tunes for the film. Interesting characters and story. The type of film I will watch more than once. I really enjoyed it.",negative
"Juliet, Naked","First, you must like romantic comedies or this will fall short. I like good ones and this earned it's place with Notting Hill. Nice plot twists, great acting and a wonderful soundtrack. This part was made for Chris O'Dowd and Rose Byrne was spectacular. Ethan Hawke played such a loser I almost had trouble understanding what any woman would see in him. However, upon mentioning that to the women nearest me in the theater - including my wife, I was immediately slapped down. They all forgave him. And, it's set in England. What more could you ask for?",positive
Anomalisa,"I am a huge Charlie Kaufman fan, and was very excited to get the chance to see this film at the Denver Film Festival this week. However, this film was extremely disappointing. The plot was quite boring and the film really just seemed to be a character study of loneliness and mental health deterioration. It would have made a great short film, but it was entirely too long for such a low-quality plot. The ending left me extremely unsatisfied.However, I did enjoy the animation, sound, and other technical aspects of the film. But I'd have to rate this 5 stars and place it next to down there next to Schenectady, New York as one of my least favorite Charlie Kaufman films. Apparently I prefer films he writes but does not direct. I'm ready for another Spike Jonze collaboration!",negative
Anomalisa,"It's been 8 years since Charlie Kaufman's directorial debut, Synedoche, New York - that great but under-appreciated little film about a man (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) who dreamed of building a scale model of New York in a warehouse. The critics seemed to like it but didn't voice their approval very loudly, and chances are many won't remember its existence. Funded by a Kickstarter campaign, Kaufman's latest is a stop-motion collaboration with Duke Johnson, an animator probably most famous for his Adult Swim works.Beginning with mundane chatter in mundane locations, Anomalisa is in no rush to hit you with any visual splendour, which tends to be the norm for animated films. Instead, we follow our miserable protagonist Michael Stone (David Thewlis), a British motivational speaker whose book on customer service is the handbook for those unfortunate enough to be in the business, as he lands in Cincinnati. He grabs a cab ride with an annoying driver who seems to be completely unaware of Michael's depressed, frustrated state, and insists he visit the zoo and tries to Cincinnati's famous chilli. He arrives at his hotel, the Fregoli, where he is unnecessarily escorted to his room by an over-friendly bell boy who informs him of the delights of his standard, mediocre room.It's probably at this point that you'll realise you haven't been imagining that all the characters look and sound alike, and instead that this is a deliberate tactic key to understanding the mindset of Michael and the themes of the film. The name of the hotel is a clue, as the Fregoli delusion is a condition that causes a person to imagine everyone else to be the same entity in disguise with the sole purpose of inflicting torment on the sufferer. Here, everyone has the face of an adult white male (even the women and children) and has been blessed with the soothing, distinctive voice of Tom Noonan. It is only when Michael stumbles upon two women in his hotel who are there to see his speech the following day that this spell is broken. One of the two women, Lisa, has a barely noticeable facial disfigurement and sounds like Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Michael is enamoured.Michael's relationship with Lisa, who be dubs 'Anomalisa', gives the film a much-needed heart, as this may have otherwise been an exercise in misanthropy. There's no fantasy romance here, but a dinner date where everyone involved drinks too much, Michael's awkward invitation for Lisa to accompany him back to his room, and a sex scene which is, ironically, the most realistic I've ever seen on film. Michael accidentally rolls onto her hair, she bangs her head, he asks her the awkward question of whether she's cool with oral sex - there's certainly no pan to a roaring fireplace,You would think that the heightened sense of realism would make the choice to film this in stop-motion slightly redundant, but oddly, it makes the film even more human. It also allows Kaufman and Johnson to show much more of life's ugliness - we are treated to Michael's middle-aged stark naked body jumping out of the shower and the sight of a random man across the way getting ready to masturbate in front of his computer. It's often difficult to sit through. I work in customer services myself and can empathise with Michael's internal struggle of feeling trapped within himself and that others are barely distinguishable from one another. Don't expect any tidy resolutions either, Kaufman is intelligent enough to realise that the excitement of meeting an interesting girl is only temporary, and life will still go on. It's upsetting, certainly, but Anomalisa offers a real insight into the human soul and makes a lasting impression.",positive
Big Eyes,"I was stuck with this movie because it was the only one that fit my schedule. I knew nothing of the plot. The beginning credits run. Amy Adams! Always a great actress. Tim Burton the director. This could be good! A good beginning to the movie. The time period is portrayed in realistic fashion. The heroine, a painter, has a difficult life. She leaves her husband. A courageous move for the time period.She has to start from scratch in a new city. She meets a fellow painter. He appears to be her soul mate. He is an interesting character. He promotes her career. They get married. Interesting process. Colorful supporting characters, including Terrance Stamp.The story stalls along the way. The punch to the story is the heroine's resentment that her husband takes credit for her paintings. She creates the paintings for him. He claims them as his own. Although he is presented as a strong-willed character, she does not have the guts to tell him to stop. She hides the secret for years. Even from her daughter! (yawn ...) Will she get the guts to stop the fraud? I could not have cared less by the time the issue was resolved. Near the end, there is a big court scene with her husband suddenly acting like he is in ""Trial and Error,"" the comedy with Jeff Daniels and Michael Richards. Although I am sure the writers thought the court scene was clever and funny, the audience I was with sat in stunned silence. When she outs her husband in the national news, her daughter is proud. We are supposed to be emotionally invested. I was bored beyond all belief. I felt manipulated. In the end, the heroine is not a sympathetic character. The supporting actors are more interesting. Would never want to see this movie again. Good style. Good characters. No plot for the characters to shine.",negative
Big Eyes,"The Warhol quote is making fun of its ghastliness and the invisible hand of the market. An odd choice to start on by mocking its own subject. As well I sense a subconscious undercurrent reflecting his own brand.But the key to Tim Burton has always been Disney not Gothic. Here is finally a proper Gothic work in being everything but, with its colorful San Francisco and Hawaii; Waltz through structures of mental control, abuse in power, serial plagiarizing, is a Gothic monster.There would be inheritances in stories like this.But it's about speech as well and how if you don't say it it'll never be said, begging the tragedy how painting isn't enough. Her eyes don't just see but can't not see. They gaze the heightened details of the world. Then would be susceptible to larger than life psychologies which would entice her in love. A Gothic torture how love controls her. Then when images can't be hers, she chooses numbers. Numerology in the pop 60s make her almost a chosen one for backing the zeitgeist: late 20th century advanced statistics would forecast and streamline every single industry. Her drawings very much forecasted the medium of anime, which rivals all of world cinema. By her own devices left unchecked might've lead to some great garage start-up, Mac, PC... Keane. In all seriousness societal mechanics denying her ability to grow in art reminds me of Burton himself trapped in the machine of his brand.Credit. Silence. Eyes. Its elements fuse a true fright. ""Mother, I know..."" Few will know the soul-crushing abuse of others taking credit for their work.Usually, a woman so pretty would not be a Tim Burton outsider but the spark of her ghoulish secret drawings make her as him. Oddest. The whole film is about these demonic traumatized orphans happening in its background. A battlefield seems to be the anger as the commodification of western privilege. But against the abstract expressionist backdrop it's a valid contrary.Most beautiful is it's this Tim Burton art film where performers are allowed to act not pose, even though it abuses green screen (its artifice you could say is Warholian at least...); much is said about the overacting, where Waltz has to strut around and make a great show of it, but he's being watched by Burton and Keane's; eyes so big warrant big visions.",positive
Serena,"Ron Rash's extraordinary novel could easily be described as a cross between MacBeth and There Will Be Blood. It is a deeply nuanced exploration of human compulsion, vicious ambition, and ultimately, evil. It is a multi-dimensional, compelling, profound and disturbing story by a man who probably knows the dark corners of Appalachia like no other living author.So I approached the film knowing that the source material held the potential for cinematic greatness – a possible modern classic. What I found, unfortunately, was a totally vapid, dumbed down, politically correct attempt to turn the character Serena (truly evil and vicious from the get-go in the book) into an admirable feminist ""macho woman"" who comes unravelled as the result of a miscarriage. Various other story elements have also been manipulated and severely distorted in the movie to make Serena more likable and understandable, especially the ending, which is a totally mindless departure from the book.The same is true of George, her husband. In the book, he is a completely egocentric robber baron, hell bent on destroying the Carolina wilderness for his own gain. He is enthralled by Serena's power, even though she ultimately turns on him. There is nothing soft or decent about him. He's entirely about power, domination and control (with the sole exception of caring for his illegitimate son).These are characters with extreme personalities, of a type that today we'd call sociopathic and psychopathic. Today we'd consider them sick and put them on meds or lock them up. Yet, historically, these were the standard personality types that drove the robber baron mentality of the era depicted in the film. At that time (and farther in the past), society tolerated far more extreme public behavior from the powerful than we do today.Unfortunately, both the screenwriter and director seem to be in way over their heads and to have totally missed this point. They've taken irrational human evil from a bygone era and tried to psychologize it into acceptable, understandable 2015-style human frailty. What Ron Rash courageously depicted with unflinching reality in his book, the makers of this film have gutted and diluted into a gorgeous soap opera. They've turned a double proof hard shot of Appalachian shine into Mountain Dew.If I could give this movie half a star, I would. I give it one star for its wonderful production values and design, which are truly Oscar-worthy. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are totally wasted here. I hope they've deleted this one from their resumes",negative
Serena,"To be honest I am only writing this review because the film has had such a negative reception. I want to make a few things clear.This film rather than following the Hollywood formula is more true to life in the sense that some European films have been. Life isn't always exciting, sometimes it can be brooding rather than fast paced with flashy cars and ""cool"" props being used to polish up perception.I would classify this as historical fiction in the sense that most films with a historical setting have a lot of flash and posturing. This film offers a view of the less glamorous times during the depression. It gives you a glimpse of the issues through the plot rather than show you first hand. Some elements are true to Hollywood such as perfectly clean main characters but conceptually this film seems like a simple slice of life.One person said you ended up not liking anyone. I think that's the entire point of the film. It's dark, brooding, and it has things to say about the nature of people and life without offering the flash and allure of a visually stunning or fun filled film. Many can't understand the setting (the depression) and might not understand the hard choices people made between survival and dreams which still relates to current life in many ways.I found the plot believable and think it's a good film for the deeper thinkers and realistic story lovers. Although poetic, it substitutes flash for substance. Instead of looking for something action packed or something to cuddle up with just accept it for what it is. It's unlikely to be pleasant for the light hearted.",positive
The Big Wedding,"I don't even know where to start on how absolutely bad this movie is.I typically only write reviews when a movie is unexpectedly great, or moving in one way or another. But I felt compelled to write a review for this movie, if nothing else than to send a message to Hollywood that viewers are actually smarter then they give us credit.You would think with a movie that features not one, not two, not three but four or more major actors would at least be tolerable. Wrong. Did I miss something, are actors just like the rest of us, living from paycheck to paycheck, barely making end's meet? That's the only excuse that would ""maybe"" allow me to accept why some of these people took these roles. Or perhaps there was an old ""debt"" that needed to be repaid to a director or studio? There must be some excuse, because anybody with any kind of preservation for their career would have passed. Robert (De Niro), are you serious? I watched you accept a lifetime achievement award a year or two ago and you went on and on about all the crappy roles you've accepted in recent years (including ""Little Fockers"", which by the way is head and shoulders about this movie) - and yet here you are again. ??? Please don't tell me YOU need a paycheck too? Bottom line: I would not be completely surprised if this movie wasn't written on the back of a bar napkin at some cheesy off the road place over the period of a couple hours. Character development is extremely shallow and inconsistent and story cohesion and development is about non-existent.Do yourself a favor and watch something else. Anything.",negative
The Big Wedding,"""The Big Wedding"" seems to be following in the footsteps of the recent Hollywood romantic comedies – gather as many big name stars as you can and put them all in a romantic comedy storyline. It's the best of the bunch, even though that's not saying anything at all. It's also based on a French film ""Mon frère se marie"", and that's not really saying all that much either.Any description of the plot is just going to read as a listing of who's who of Hollywood. But let's do it anyways: We have the patriarch and matriarchs (Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton and Susan Sarandon); we have the up-and-comers excited for their big day (Ben Barnes and Amanda Seyfried); and then we have the middle siblings who have had their time in the spotlight and are starting to fade away (Topher Grace and Katherine Heigl).The wedding revolves around lies (obviously) and religion - with Robin Williams as the drunken Catholic priest. And it also includes lots and lots of sex jokes. The surprising thing that audiences are taking away from this film, especially in spite of the decidedly negative critics' responses, is that it is hilarious. Fans of the film will find themselves laughing from beginning to end. But to give you fair warning, all of the jokes are sexually-based, and I mean all of them.Laughing at the Catholic stigma of don't have sex but if you do, don't be safe; laughing at people who have too much sex; laughing at people who don't have sex; and worse of all, laughing at divorced and married couples who have sex with one another. While some of the jokes were funny, they're also responsible for creating the uneasy dynamic amongst the characters – all of whom are family (or, at least, are about to become in-laws). At times the film crosses the line from funny dysfunctional family to repulsive dysfunctional family.The one line that ""The Big Wedding"" straddles well is that between comedy and drama. The film is effective when it moves from funny jokes to touching family honesty and back to some more funny jokes. The story lines are very predictable, and sometimes the jokes are too simple and too wrong, but it tries to add in the right amount of drama, and ultimately, it should be entertaining to fans of the genre.",positive
"Everything, Everything","'Everything, Everything' gives off every vibe of just another 'Fault in Our Stars' but impressively enough, it somehow does something just a little differently. Whether it was the clear chemistry and/or the fantastic acting ability given off by Amanda Stenberg, it ultimately results in a product that is pure and genuine that shows a young love as innocent and honest as it could be. Besides minor petty things, there is not much to complain about. Being a typical young adult drama, I can not give a stronger rating but all things considered, this is a glowing thumbs up for 'Everything, Everything'.",negative
"Everything, Everything","*MAJOR PLOT RUINING SPOILERS*I liked the story as much as I enjoy any other sappy teenage romance. There are unforgivable ""movie sins"" in this movie that I can not get over though and that is the way that child abuse is handled. The main huge plot twist of this movie is that Maddy's mother was a delusional child abuser who kept her daughter locked in a glass cage with the threat of dying from a disease that she didn't have. The way in which the movie handles this is having Maddy run away to nurse Carla, her previous caretaker and only other human contact who got fired for allowing her to stand in the same room as another human being. This first step was amazing but from then on it just went down hill. Maddy does not press charges and her mother is treated like she is also a victim who should be offered sympathy. This is neither a realistic and human response to that kind of situation nor is it morally right. The movie ends with a mentally unstable individual who imprisoned someone for their entire life walking free with no consequences. If the woman is capable of that kind of craziness than what horrors will she inflict upon the world now after her victim has escaped.",positive
If I Stay,"When I first saw the trailer for If I Stay back in April, I got chills and it quickly became one of my top five most anticipated movies of the summer. From then on, I stayed away from all other trailers and clips so that I could see the movie knowing as little as possible, to the point where I'd put the TV spots on mute and run out of the theater when a trailer came on. Based on the trailer I saw, I honestly expected something similar to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, or a dramatic Inception. However, after having finally seen it this weekend, I am sad to report that If I Stay is nothing like that at all, and is instead probably my most disappointing movie of the summer.If I Stay follows Mia, played by Chloe Grace Moretz, an 18 year old girl who likes classical music and cello, and who's still not quite over her ex, Adam (Jamie Blackley). Then on a snowy day, her life is completely turned upside down when her family and she get into a deadly car crash, sending her into a coma. In this coma, she has an out of body experience in which she needs to decides either to die and go up to heaven or live with the physical and emotional repercussions, all while flashing back to the relationship she and Adam had.The movie is primarily made up of flashbacks to the relationship that Mia and Adam had, and the chemistry that the two of them share isn't very strong and can be described as okay at best. Chloe Grace Moretz is a talented young actress who really gives it her best in this film, whereas her costar Jamie Blackley ranges from decent to mediocre. The relationship between their two characters is cute and sort of fun for the first half of the movie. However, in the second half when their relationship slowly starts to go downhill, Adam becomes a jerk and is unlikeable and unreasonable, which made me have a tough time feeling bad for him when he was an emotional wreck. Also, with Adam and Mia's relationship, something felt missing. Rather than true love, it felt like a typical high school relationship where the two people think they're love, then someday breakup and later realize that they never actually were in love.Then all the other characters are either annoying or underdeveloped. Mia's parents are somewhat likable, however, most of their jokes and dialogue come off as either flat or cringe-worthy. Then there's this couple who is close friends to Mia's parents, and they are present in the hospital for most of the movie and in many of the flashbacks. In one scene they talk about never wanting to have children, but then they are later seen in another scene with a baby (referred to as their son) who is then never referenced or seen again afterwards. The one exception to all this would be Mia's grandfather, played by Stacy Keach, and he had one scene in particular that I did really like (those who have seen the movie can probably guess what scene it was). Perhaps I am just being biased since I do enjoy Keach and his acting, but I do think he gave a good performance.Now I have some things to say regarding the ending. I'm not going to outright say any spoilers, but I'm kind of going to imply what happens in the end. Therefore, if you do not want anything spoiled about If I Stay, skip this next paragraph.Mia makes her decision to stay or leave based off of a five minute speech that one character makes to her, and then the movie ties itself up really nice in a bow and leaves everything real hopeful and bright for the characters. While I do like happy endings, I felt in this case a less hopeful ending would have been better suited to really make her decision difficult. Not Requiem For a Dream level hopeless, but rather cutting the whipped cream and cherry on top. However, I do have to say that with the route they chose, the last ten seconds of the film were perfect. The place where the last shot cut could not have been better.In the end, If I Stay is just another average teen romance movie, and it's not even all that interesting. The trailer makes the movie seem like a tear-jerking drama that takes place all in her mind about her decision to live or die, when in reality, it's a high school love story consisting of 70% flashbacks that only spends a small portion with her out of body experience. I REALLY don't want to give this movie anything below a 6/10 because of how much I had been looking forward to it for so long, but I have to give it a 5/10. It's even possible that in the future my score will go even lower. While it is somewhat entertaining, If I Stay is a rather weak romance movie for teens and is overall very forgettable.",negative
If I Stay,"Anyone interested in this film already knows the premise by now if they have read this far, so I won't rehash it.All I will say is that this film could have easily been contrived and cheesy and hokey and clichéd but rather, the end is result is truly one of the finest, most real representations of youth and love I have seen in a long time. And the fact that it seemed so genuine is exactly why I have not cried in a film so much since....""The Perks of Being a Wallflower."" Chloe Grace Moretz has already proved she is a force to be reckoned with, but by an accomplishment like playing the key character in a film that was made to be a tearjerker without coming across as completely laughable shows what a strong actress this young woman truly is.Excellent, relatable script, wonderful direction and perfectly edited, the fact the a bunch of tween girls went ""Huh? What? That's the end?"" when the credits began to roll proved that R.J. Cutler knew exactly when to end this film at the precise moment. There was no need to overstay the welcome.Make sure you have some Kleenex.",positive
Winter's Tale,"If you have not read the book, use this review as a reason to either bypass the film initially and read the book first, or to understand that the screenplay is a huge departure from the intended story.The novel Winter's Tale is a romance with a supernatural overtone bathed in a tribute to New York City if it could always remain in a mystical state. The book is sometimes verbose, often funny, and heartfelt in it's depiction of love. The movie insults your intellect by ignoring the vast symbolism used in the book. Example: Time Travel - The book allows for you to understand certain characters have time traveled, while the movie insists certain characters travel only to follow others telling you that they are supernatural beings. It's NOT so. Here is exactly where the director really fowled the film. Deviating from the author's intent, turning the story into a devil's agents interplay is awkward out of place. The devil was NEVER once mentioned or implied in the original story. Yes, some devices are necessary in film to help the audience, but Pearly Soames purpose as a protagonist in the film is reduced to silly. Furthermore Pearly's reason for chasing Peter had nothing to do with Peter's love for Beverly. Pearly never met Beverly in the novel. Here is one more non-spoiler as it too won't be found in the film. In the book, Pearly's purpose for chasing Peter Lake began the moment he forced Peter Lake into his employ and Peter later turned a huge heist against Pearly. Pearly's gang was decimated for a time. From that day forward, Pearly's will to kill Peter grew in every chase that left him empty handed.Being sold as a straight up romance or love story is almost a mistake because the film does try to encompass the much larger story surrounding the love affair. From Peter Lake's horse which has a story of his own to a wildly funny malapropian newspaper editor named Craig Binky. Other Characters such as Virginia Gamely were altered ridiculously. Virginia was from the Lake of the Coherees in the novel. In the film, she is just another New Yorker. This is where the film falls apart. The director's vain effort to include the other threaded stories inside the book are convoluted.When you use the same title as a book for a movie it's wise to make an honest adaptation, otherwise change the name of the movie from the book entirely to avoid comparisons entirely. Then follow the guide of placing in the credits, ""based on the story Winter's Tale by Mark Helprin."" Director Akiva Goldsman (also wrote the screenplay) zig-zagged across both these traditional paths and the story suffered in his mash-up. Change a characters hair color, but don't change their role or destiny. In this case Winter's Tale isn't even a director's interpretation. The book weaves a subtle supernatural element that may be so vague that the director wanted to spell it out to moviegoers. In doing so, he dumbs down the original story to the point it insults the audience, holding their hand and telling them what to think as opposed to letting the moviegoer figure things out.Winter's Tale is condensed, filtered and sanitized of it's soul. Even without having read the novel, evidence of awkward changes for the screenplay dumb down the original subtle supernatural theme which was ironically as clear in it's message as it was abstract in it's delivery.As a romance film there are heartfelt moments and the chemistry between Peter Lake and Beverly Penn does have enough strength to bring a tear to some audience members. Collin Farrell's soft humanity is felt quite often too. Yet, except for a candid conversation among the two men Peter Lake and Isaac Penn which draws an intellectual laugh, there is no humor to break up the tension in the film. Yes, the contrast of the book is once again worth noting. The book had meaningful characters which were lost in the movie. They were not a direct part of the love story, and as such were eliminated. Eliminating so many great elements of the original story killed the journey Peter Lake would take you through. The cinematography alone in Winter's Tale was not enough to paint the fantastic picture of the magical New York City the author intended as a character in the story. Without that fabric the mystical world Peter Lake and Beverly Penn exist is absent. Winter's Tale is a complex supernatural love story with too many important characters to have fit into a short two or three hour film. It's not written in a manner that would translate into a part one and part two series either. Perhaps it's best medium will one day be a mini- series a network can allow to play out over five to eight episodes. It's often said that the journey is the reward and the story of Winter's Tale is a long journey that cannot be condensed. In this case, spotlighting one part of the journey is not fulfilling either. Let's just make one thing clear to anyone that has neither read the book nor seen the movie. The love story in this film takes place in the first quarter of the novel. There are three remaining quarters to the story that thread the love story of Peter Lake and Beverly Penn into the overall journey, but their story is told early and ends early. Well, that's not entirely true. And yet it is. Now for all those clues and a tease, don't you just wonder what a book that has three quarters more to say – has to say? For my full review just search my name, Lars Hindsley and you'll find DangerMans Lair.",negative
Winter's Tale,"As the reviews indicate either you'll love it or hate it. I loved it, my wife hated it. Quite a turnaround considering I wanted to see Robocop, but it was her turn to pick. Slow and confusing in the beginning but picked up speed after the first encounter of Peter and Beverly. The Characters were immediately likable and the two child actresses were captivating. Russell Crowe was great as Demi-Demon Pearly Soames. The visuals were terrific. It kind of made me think of Titanic with Demons, Angels and even a Pegasus replacing the Boat. All under the winter NYC backdrop. Pay attention to the dialogue because there were several of those ""oh wow - that's what that meant"" moments later on.",positive
Anthropoid,"I have seen a lot of WW2 films from all sides. I've seen many Yugoslav films from my own country, American films showing either theaters (Pacific or Europe), a few from different countries like France, Poland, etc. quite a few Holocaust ones, ones with their own internal conflict (Finland's war with Russia) etc. I've seen many, many Russian ones (most recently Panfilov's 28) and American ones (Saving Private Ryan, but recently Hacksaw Ridge). I've seen expensive ones and cheap ones (Pathfinders: In the Company of Strangers, budget is supposedly $0, it's all volunteer work), serious ones about the Holocaust and comic ones like Tarantino's. I've seen short ones (The German, 2008) and I've seen Band of Brothers.I've seen a lot, more than most people.Having said that, this one is my favorite. It's the only one where I felt I was there, I was not just an observer, but I felt like I was part of the crew. This is the only film, war or not, in which I felt that I was there. I've never had such a strong connection to a film before.There may be inaccuracies, the personalities were a bit filmified/movie-ized, but this movie gets 10/10 on the acting and delivery of emotion.Wow. Just wow.",negative
Anthropoid,"Mission - To assassinate a top ranking Nazi Officer, Reinhard Heydrich. Not many films leave me feeling this much emotion.. so much so, I felt the need to write my 2nd review in around 5 years! I thought the casting was an interesting choice and Cillian Murphy and Jamie Dornan didn't disappoint but I really loved Anna Geislerova. Although most of the action is towards the end of the film, the lead up to the events gave a good insight to the characters which I find some films lack as they are too busy concentrating on special effects, rather than getting to know the characters. . I found myself holding my breath on many occasions! A truly gripping finale and I will definitely be watching this again.",positive
Bridget Jones's Baby,"There is, indeed, something wrong with Zellweger's face job. The stretched eyes, the botoxed forehead, the puffed out lips - made a joke out of the Bridget Jones character. And the British accent - by now wouldn't it be MORE believable after the third outing instead of something from a high school drama class? Zellweger's scrunched up facial expressions have become identical - pain, thinking, happy all look the same. The premise of the movie - that a 43-year-old woman can't tell who fathered her child - is painfully stupid.",negative
Bridget Jones's Baby,"I absolutely loved Bridget Jones's Baby! I was afraid that after all this time, the humor of the previous films (especially the first one) would be lost. I was very pleasantly surprised! My husband, who never cared for romantic comedies, actually watched the entire movie and laughed most of the way through. It is great to see Bridget at a later stage of her life. ( as well as the other characters... Mark Darcy,Jade, etc.) I would highly recommend it to any ""true"" Bridget fan. I also agree with some others that Emma Thompson was a great addition to the cast. I just bought the DVD and have already watched it again. It is great to see a sequel and not be disappointed!",positive
Someone Great,"I cringed throughout the entire movie. The dialogues sound horribly fake and unnatural. It semms like the writers opened up Urban dictionary and took all the hashtaggy, instagrammy buzz words to sound young and hip. The whole movie is unrelateble, horribly stereotypical and unfunny. Not one good laugh! I'm a 30 year old female living in New York City, just like the main characters, but I don't know anyone who talks like that or acts like that. Maybe this is aimed at a teenage audience who thinks this is what cool girls do and talk like in NYC. Bad plot, bad dialogue, bad jokes.",negative

When We First Met,"""When We First Met"" is a half-baked mashup of ideas that have been explored more skillfully and interestingly in ""The Butterfly Effect,"" ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Bedazzled."" Whereas GD explored the male-centric notion that a man can conquer any woman's heart with determination, perseverance and a readiness to change through growth and maturation, WWFM assumes the female-centric view that there can be only one perfect match which is somehow divinely ordained and guided by destiny. The result is somewhat incoherent and nonsensical. Adam Devine plays Noah, a somewhat nerdish underachiever with seemingly limitless potential, who is smitten by überbabe Avery (Alexandra Daddario), whose underutilization in this film borders on the criminal. Not only is she given so little to do that her sentiments are often expressed by BFF Carrie (Shelley Hennig), but, in chickflick fashion, she is dressed so modestly, save for a hint of cleavage, that one wonders if the actress has become pregnant and is dressed in body-comatose (if that's the antonym of body-conscious) outfits to disguise a growing baby bump.Noah, through no fault of his own, has been consigned by Avery to the infuriatingly inescapable friend zone. Through some fortuitous divine intervention, he is repeatedly whisked back in time to the fateful day when he blew whatever chance he thinks he might have had with Avery and given several opportunities to change his game plan. He manages to capture her body, but not her heart, while causing substantial collateral damage in other areas of his life, but is whisked back to the present with no memory of whatever sexual ecstasy they may have shared. Performances are generally good, although Devine and Daddario are hampered by an unimaginative script. Henning delivers a varied and interesting performance, reacting to different permutations of Devine's character. Andrew Bachelor channels Eddie Murphy as Noah's best friend. Production values are adequate to the task. However, while occasionally amusing, I never found the film laugh-out-loud funny. The film takes itself too seriously to be funny. Noah's efforts to escape the friend zone are treated as something bordering on rape mentality. He never enjoys his time with Avery or much of anything else in his alternate realities. He suffers because he can't have Avery, then suffers because having Avery's body but not her soul doesn't live up to his fantasy. Where's the humor in that?",negative

I Origins,"40 minutes into the movie the religion is served to you nice and warm, fresh, and ready to eat. You are told what to think, given biased views, and plenty of illogical premises, mmmm! What? But, but... the acting is actually GOOD!? Lots of the science is bogus, but, not that much more bogus than so-so Hollywood flicks... How can this be a religious flick?Just enjoy the show my friend... no more religion, we're so sorry.1:15:00 in, and oie, one of the lead roles suddenly believes in religion for no explainable reason other than to drive the plot, which has now crumbled, ever forward, toward Sunday school.Your choice of a Cesar's things to Caesar Salad, or an unlimited amount of Breadsticks and Fish, oui misure?Now you're forced to choose something else entirely, as after this point, the religion is thrust down your throat nearly every scene, until at 1:26:00 we're faced with a religious debate between our scientist and some lady that logically pummels him using illogical reasoning, and clearly, somehow, the music tells us that she pwns him with something that is apparently supposed to make logical sense but keep in mind this is a work of fiction.It is apparent that this moment is ""the point"" of watching the movie, because from this second on, you can practically describe every next scene in complete detail.

I Origins,"We watch at least 4 or 5 movies every week, and I have to say that this is the best film I've seen in a long time. Brit Marling seems to choose her films very carefully, and I'm coming to suspect that anything she's involved in is going to be different, and very well done.This film is inspiring - not just because of it's content, but because of the way it's made. Hollywood can NOT make films like this. They can do a lot of things, but they can't seem to write scenes, scenarios, and certainly not dialog like this. This feels like real life, and because of this, it really effects you and draws you in. You really get to know, understand and care about the characters, in a way that just doesn't seem to happen in 'Hollyweird' films.I don't want to go into any detail about the film here. I just want to say that it is truly amazing, unpredictable, beautiful, powerful and worth your time.IMPORTANT: Be sure not to turn it off as the credits roll - there's a great little additional scene at the very end, which ads another dimension to the way the story wraps up.Truly excellence in film making. If there were more writer/directors like this, the world would be a better place. He makes us think and challenges us. Truly inspirational.My highest recommendation.Will Middle of NowHere, in some snowy, remote Canadian mountains",positive
Before We Go,"Love this movie. It shows many perspective of what relationship are like with friends, strangers, lovers, exes, etc. The real beauty of this film is that it tells you your true strength that you don't even know you have it. It is a beautiful movie, and not everything has to be about intimacy or lust or showing off you skin. Sometimes you need someone to talk to and share your feelings.

Great work !!! The ending is very beautiful and touching.",negative

I was curious myself. I googled it but didn't find any useful answer. So I went to sleep and awoke with this possible interpretation in mind:First, think back to the scene where they were drawing on the back of the artwork at the hotel. Remember that we never got to see what they drew/wrote.In the end, as she is looking at the guest survey, and sees the arrow and instruction to ""turn over,"" she flips the card, and it looks like the word ""remember"" is there...I think he's reminding her that he has a message for her behind the artwork at the hotel (which she would also have to ""turn over"" to read). And of course to retrieve the message would mean another trip back to NYC, somehow acquiring or getting into that exact room, and hoping the message is still there.For two who seem to believe in serendipity, it's perfect. It leaves open the possibility of another adventure. And another adventure on top of that depending on what the message says.I'm pretty sure she'll take him up on the adventure.Anyway, that's my two cents.",positive
Breathe,"As Robin Cavendish clamors repeatedly that he wants to die after feeling stifled living in a Hospital, it takes much persuasion from his wife Diana to think the other way round. Here is a man who wants to see and cherish the outside world and his incapacity to do that makes him shun from the very existence of it.The movie ""Breathe"" transports you to a period where the severely disabled and in this context from the malignant polio are restrained from the rest of the society and how they spend the rest of their lives in the hospitals, even though they ache for Freedom. Robin decided to embark on freedom and this movie is an ode to his attempt to integrate into society despite his breathing difficulty, for which he uses an electric breathing tube. Robin aided by his good friend Teddy and his supportive wife Diana and son Jonathan finally manage to live the dream. Though the climax is a bit of an aberrant, but since the real life Jonathan Cavendish financed the movie and initiated the screenplay on his fathers' life, the events in the climax should be true. Andy Serkis in his directorial debut offers a decent movie with the focus mostly on Robin's life during the polio crisis. There is nothing extra-ordinary about his directing, but he manages to deliver a sensitive topic with charm and light humor, though these kind of movies require much more coherent drama and I found that lacking. The actors have a good job with the pick being Andrew Garfield, who continues to dwell in different characters and his portrayal of Robin is definitely note-worthy. Claire Foy, has a decent chemistry with Garfield, but compared to her titular role in the Crown, this seems kind of a cake walk. The rest of the cast including Tom Hollander,Hugh Bonneville and Jonathan Hyde play the parts with what the characters demand.The light hearted nature of plot is indeed a drawback as this movie somehow lacks the strong punch. The romantic portions between Robin and Diana is nothing extraordinary even in presentation and seems quite a cliché. Yes, the intent of the movie was not the romance, but even that somehow feels fizzled out.Overall, Breathe is a decent movie owing to the actors and less with the screenplay. Its worth a watch, however I personally believe the tale of Robin Cavendish needed a more packed and stronger plot. Considering the movie Wonder that had so many beautiful moments, this one kind of fails in that.",negative
Breathe,"Saw this film last night without reading any previously written reviews, and I thought it absolutely outstanding. The devotion that Robin and Diana had for each other, encountering such a life altering event only one year into a marriage would likely destroy most marriages. Addressing the ignorance and lack of empathy from the medical community must have been a real slog, and it is to their credit that such amazing inroads were made to better the lives of polio victims and other disabled persons. While the world has become a better place for those ""outside the norm"", there is still so much yet to be done. The cast and Jonathan Cavendish should win all the BAFTAs and Oscars possible. This film gave me hope that we can all be better than we are.",positive

Sleeping with Other People,"Let's start by saying, you can't take the title as an accurate representation of this movie. It suits it very well though, just not in a literal sense. Some people didn't like it because they expected an original comedy about open relationships and got a romantic comedy about two emotionally messed up individuals. And if you aren't expecting it to be something else, this movie absolutely nails it.I know not everyone wants to see a movie about those kind of characters, but I'm really sick of rom-coms about people who have a healthy relationship with sex unless they're a bad guy or someone whose not mean to find love. I thought it was really refreshing to see characters with these issues and the movie was well done. Sure it's a romantic comedy with all the right clichés and cheeky music, and sure the characters aren't relatable to everyone, but for me, it was just perfect.",positive
Knight of Cups,"Beautiful shots, lots of them. 2 hours of perfume ads, with an unhappy protagonist, Christian Bale.

He keeps on going against conventional movie making. His style is hypnotic and gorgeous. What I took away after and while watching this movie is that it is a observational piece on human behavior. It made me realize how crazy the human race is. The way we enjoy entertainment, treat our women and live our lives. It's all a really surreal thing for a species to do. Apart from the plot, this movie is mesmerizing and extremely relaxing to watch. The soundtrack is trippy and hypnotic as always and Malick is really settling on a certain (like it or hate it) style of filmmaking. It's very personal whether you like his films or not. To me personally his films are wonderful observational pieces of art that should be stored and preserver for future generations to reflect upon.

The Mountain Between Us,"When I left the cinema after enduring this film my thoughts immediately turned to IMDb and what kind of response it would have had on this site.I imagined that (like myself) there would be floods of complaints about the wooden acting, the ease at which the main characters just sauntered through their 'ordeal' as though they were just nipping to the shops for a pint and a dozen eggs, and thought that it would be universally hated.I read one review today that said this was the worst movie they'd seen in the last thirty years.Well I sat through Dads Army, I just about managed to stay awake during the Absolutely Fabulous movie but even those two flops were more convincing than this film.What is supposed to be a high drama survival movie is a bland, dull, uninspiring walk through the snow for an hour and half. Even the moments of peril are dealt with in as short a time as possible with no fear or risk involved whatsoever. The romance is unconvincing to me. Before anything happened between our two lead characters I was thinking to myself that these guys clearly didn't like each other at all during the filming of this movie. There was little to no chemistry, the acting was woeful (from two of movies finest actors supposedly) and it all just seemed tired and as if nobody on the set wanted to be there.The story's climax isn't a climax at all. It's just a sudden give-up on what had come before.I have to agree with the chap who said they'd not seen worse in a long long time. This was most definitely the weakest of all the movies I've seen in years. My advice to anyone considering it is as always go and make your own mind up. But don't say I didn't warn you.",negative

The Host,"The current score on IMDb is too low. This is a fairly good film. It's worth about a 7.5. To see the true IMDb score, click the link for the number of users and look at the bell graph. Eliminate the 1s and 10s, and you'll see that what you're left with is a solid 7.Saoirse Ronan was perfectly cast for this role as the sensitive, conflicted alien slowly gaining the trust of the human survivor group. Diane Kruger and William Hurt were also good. (Once again, I'm struck how so many Hollywood movies lately have non-American actors playing Americans. What's that all about?) ""The Host"" is part of a new genre I would call ""sci fi for chicks"". If it bothers you to see a ""soft"" science-fiction film with love-sick young people, noble suicides, impossibly handsome young men, aliens with emotions, etc., don't go see this one. It's the old male v. female dilemma: Should we kill the hated aliens or coax them out and make friends with them? There was not enough exposition at the start about the horrors of the alien invasion. The writers and producers seem to have assumed that moviegoers would understand why the characters want to ""remain human"" and why they would refer to a human-hosted alien as ""it"". Perhaps it was better explained in the book.The device of Melinda's consciousness remaining fully alert, and Wanda and Melinda actually talking to each other for our benefit, might put some moviegoers off. (I'm not sure. I haven't read the other reviews.) However, once I suspended my disbelief, I was able to go with the flow.They threw the male viewers a bone: Kruger and Ronan, to start. there were a few car and motorcycle chases (involving futuristic-looking chrome vehicles), and shoot outs. Hey, this is a Hollywood movie, after all.The theme of humans hosting aliens is not original, but they took the concept in a different direction. The movie is slick and well made, but there were a few clichés and many, many aspects of the story that were glossed over, left unexplained or just not realistic. The survivors here were mostly young Hollywood pretty boys, not a ragged group of tough survivors (like on ""Walking Dead"", for example.)Still, I appreciated some of the details of the ""good alien"" theme, like a society of honest and trustworthy aliens that doesn't need cash to function, or where they will simply give you their car if you need it, or where everyone drives at the speed limit. (God forbid we should have a society like that! Kill them!) And I liked the part where the other seekers looked at the evil seeker (played by Kruger) and pointed out that she was getting a little too obsessed. After all the aliens saw themselves as the good guys. There are many species that coexist in symbiosis. It's interesting to think that maybe it would do our species good. This is actually a very old theme. There's not much difference between ""her body has been taken over by an alien"" and ""she is filled with the Holy Spirit"", or even ""she is possessed by a demon"".",negative
The Host,"Outside of The Twilight Saga, The Host is Stephanie Meyer's biggest novel and since the success of her supernatural series, her sci-fi novel has been adapted. There is a stronger cast and director for The Host, than the Twilight Saga, but how does it fare on its own terms? In the near future, Earth has been conquered by a parasitic alien race known as The Souls, who implant themselves into human bodies. Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan) is a member of the human resistance who gets captured when she tries to protect her younger brother, Jamie (Chandler Canterbury). Melanie gets implanted with a Soul, called Wanderer, with the aliens planning to use Melanie's memories in order to find the human resistance. As Wanderer explores Melanie's memories, she finds out about Melanie's lover, Jared (Max Irons) and the pair plan an escape to the desert to find the resistance camp. Within the camp, Wanderer falls for another human, Ian (Jake Abel), causing problems for all of them.Let's get the comparisons with Twilight out the way; yes there is a is love triangle (or should that be a love square?), The Host has a much better lead actress with Ronan then Kirsten Stewart and has a stronger supporting cast, with the likes of William Hurt and Diane Kruger. Andrew Niccol also gives the film more creditability behind the camera, acting as both the writer and director. The Host has interesting ideas that had many potential avenues to explore: but unfortunately it focuses more on the love story instead of all of the other aspects that could have lead to a much more meaningful film.Ronan does rise above the material and gives very strong performance, as you would expect from her. This is even more remarkable that she has to argue and talk with herself, like Homer Simpson arguing with his own brain. Whilst there was the potential for themes of locked in syndrome as Melanie is trapped inside her own head, fighting to control her own body or going through a more literal, internal conflict. But it turns really silly when she argues with herself over two men, as opposed of having a much more difficult time of having a stronger conflict within her character. Ronan gets battered and beaten throughout the film as she gets hit, verbally abused and discriminated against and yet, still persevere through everything she's up against.Whilst Ronan does a good job, the two men she is meant to be conflicted about are blank stales. Neither actor has much of a personality or character and they are very indistinguishable from each other. Ronan has no choice but to carry the film, considering that there was nothing going for the main love interests. At least Hurt and Kruger looked like they were having fun with their roles and were highly professional with their performances.The idea of some sort of insider for an oppressive regime having an awakening, usually because a love interest and ends up turning against their own side has been used before. We have seen it in novels like Nineteen-Eighty Four, Fahrenheit 451 and We and films such as Metropolis and THX-1138. The Host does twist this age old idea in sci-fi, even if the execution was lacking.The Host had a really strong premise with opportunities to explore multiple themes. They could have been themes about identity, the battle within the mind, split personalities, trust and how humans would survive after this invasion. But like Twilight, the film only touches on these concepts and puts all of its focus in the wrong places.Much like Twilight, The Host has been criticised for its dialogue and being unintentionally funny. It is true that the film has some bad dialogue, but with some of the moments that were comical that had be intentional, with some of its moments of cultural clash and the bickering between Wanderer and Melanie. There are also some dark moments and there were really refreshing when they do come around.Niccol is known for being an excellent writer director, making Gattaca and Lord of War and was nominated for an Academy Awards for his screenplay for The Truman Show. The Host is his first adaptation and it felt very rigidly close to the source material. What it results to is a bland experience that has episodic nature, having mini-plots with some developments, instead of a larger overarching story. Looks wise, the film is pretty flat and dull, using nothing but silver chrome for the alien technology, concrete and glass for the buildings and the humans are based in an empty desert environment. The cinematography and the special effects were solid but, Niccol was coasting and he is much more capable then this.Currently on Rotten Tomatoes, The Host has an 12% rating and seemingly on course to be considered one of the worst films of 2013. Whilst it is hard to argue that The Host is a good movie, it is certainly not terrible: its crime is merely being mediocre, dull and forgettable.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",positive
Safe Haven,"There are mass murderers and former dictators rotting away in prison cells who have done better for the human condition than author, Nicholas Sparks. If Nicholas Sparks was a conflict he would be the Hundred Years War; if he were a baseball team he would be the 1962 New York Mets; if he were a boxer he'd be Jerry Quarry.Since 2004's ""The Notebook,"" which at least earned praise for the inclusion of veteran stars James Garner and Gena Rowlands, but catcalls for Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams (at least Gosling has become a better actor since), Sparks has become the antithesis to romantic dramas and to good film, in general. Follow-ups such as ""Dear John,"" ""The Last Song"" and ""The Lucky One,"" have all gotten progressively (or even exponentially) worse. That pattern continues with his latest Valentine's Day release, ""Safe Haven,"" which is nothing more than ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" meets ""The Lucky One."" In fact, during this picture I quietly prayed for Zac Efron to appear and make everything better again.Directed by Lasse Hallström (the man behind such quality productions as ""My Life as a Dog,"" ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" and ""The Cider House Rules""), this picture has a woman on the run trying to hide her identity but stumbles upon love in an unbelievably bucolic North Carolina fishing village.Katie (""Rock of Ages"" Julianne Hough, as in ""hough"" did she get up on the big screen? Answer, she's living with Ryan Seacrest — talk about sleeping one's way to the bottom) flees a murder rap in Boston in a bus and is trying to avoid a psycho police office (David Lyons, ""Eat Pray Love""). Conveniently, she settles in South Point where few people speak, with the exception of general store owner Alex (Josh Duhamel, ""Transformers"" franchise), a widower with a cute, ready-made Hollywood family (including the robotic kid actor who was so bad in ""Playing for Keeps"").He is smitten, but she's a cold fish (remember, she has ""secrets"" that WE know about, but Alex does not). He makes small talk, she ignores it, he gives her a bicycle, she cannot accept it, etc., etc., etc. But of course, since this is a Nicholas Sparks' adaptation, you know love — and a certain amount of lust — is just lurking around the corner.Soon, she discovers what a wonderful, caring, handsome man he is — and he loves children, to boot. Alex is, after all, a '90s woman. In the third act, though, we know a certain cop will show up to add what little drama his arrival can add to a film like this and it takes a plot twist from the planet Pluto to save the day.It has been said that Sparks (who now boasts his own production company, so the ""fun"" will continue for years to come) has trouble writing men, but can certainly capture women. After ""Safe Haven,"" I can honestly say he cannot write ANYONE. His latest effort is schmaltzy, predictable, clichéd to the point of absurdity, and has no chemistry whatsoever between his good-looking leads. In fact, now that I think about it, ""Safe Haven"" actually is the perfect Valentine's Day date movie — provided, of course, that you and your date avoid it at all costs.",negative
Safe Haven,"I may be partial to the film having waited a long time to see it. As soon as I found out Julianne Hough had been cast (I' a long standing fan from back in her DWTS days!) I knew I just had to see the film! I went out and bought the book and quickly read it in a matter of days. When I finally saw the film I was not disappointed. Although some features of the book had been changed I felt that the key elements were there. I appreciated the directorial style of Lasse Halstrom.Julianne Hough, in my biased opinion, was stellar. As a breakthrough in her first serious dramatic role I was impressed. Josh Duhamel as usual is lovely and beautiful to watch on screen. The real scene stealer, however, is young Mimi Kirkland who plays Lexie. Her comedic timing and toothless smile added an adorable element to the film.The whole film seemed so natural that there was an obvious, stark contrast to the drama and thriller aspect in the end. When Kevin Tierney reaches Katie in Southport the tone of the film changes. You've almost forgotten that you're watching a film, but rather a real relationship be built when suddenly Tierney is there, brooding over the characters.I loved the film depiction of this novel as well as the acting of Josh, Julianne, Mimi, Cobie Smulders, and Noah Lomax. I highly recommend it and would go so far as to say it's a must see! Of course the romantic comedy fans will eat it up, but the men who are dragged along might enjoy it more than they think!",positive

Paper Towns,"Paper Towns. Paper Movie. For all its talk about those flat, hollow, deceiving facades, Paper Towns very quickly became what it seemingly tries to warn against. I feel swindled, conned, beguiled, paper mooned, pun intended! I was promised a whimsical, memorable, romantic romping young hearts, teenage adventure, a racing love story, risking it all, faint of heart never won fair lady and such! However, after a confusing, long, rather uneventful, and at times painfully awkward two hours, right when we've reached her, this woman of mystery and intrigue, who our shy hero has risked it all to find, there is............ nothing. No big, dramatic declaration, no tear-filled fantasy ending. No Magic. Paper Towns. Paper Love. It was like coming up empty handed at the end of the rainbow. Where is the whimsy, the destiny, the fleeting promise this movie had in the preview? Where were the passionate, young romantics, the real people that found each other in a paper world? Or did those shining figures exist only in our minds, were they paper stars that readily deceived? The best part for me was when Mr. Augustus Waters made an adorably unexpected cameo, a lovely reminder of what a REAL love story was the genuine gold value, that this paper, soulless, disposable nothing paled against. It's baffling to me, that the ingenious, and powerfully compelling Fault in Our Stars, and this cruel trick of a caper, Paper Towns were both penned by the same man. In truth, the moment I saw Gus, it made me wish I was watching his movie instead. This could have been a brilliant, spontaneous, wonder of a film, if its execution and ending had not so instantly caught fire. Well, then again, what better tinder for fire than ........ paper.",negative
Paper Towns,"Is it worth the price of a rental? Yes.I absolutely loved this movie! As 3 friends come to the end of their senior year. Quentin (played by Nat Wolff) sets out on an adventure likes he's never had before. There is very little that disappointed me in this film. As a matter of fact, my only real complaint was the character of Margo (played by Cara Delevingne), I can't quite put my finger on it but i found her character to be annoying throughout the first act. She was very monotone although she had this opinionated know it all attitude. However, since most of the film after that is about finding Margo, her character is not a problem anymore. I realize that the genre of the film is ""Drama, Mystery, Romance"", I think it is safe to add Adventure , Comedy to the mix. This film made good on the mystery of Margo while adding the adventure of the night before she goes missing along with the adventure that Quentin embarks throughout this entire film looking for Margo. I also found the movie to be very funny with best friends like Radar (played by Justice Smith) and Ben (played by Ben Abrams). These two have completely different characters from one another but together make for a great and funny friendship. Much comedic relief comes from the interaction of the two best friends alone and the scenes where it's all three of them.I liked the cinematography in this film very much. There were pretty lens flares that I thought were suitable for this type of film and in the scenes that they used them. There was something about the slow motion car shots that I loved as well. A good use of shallow depth of field to concentrate on solely one character at times and no shots that were visually a distraction that I noticed.I loved all the music that they put into the film. This was a definite plus for me.Lastly, I love the message of this film. A young man graduating from high school with his whole future planned (college, marriage, kids, career) only to realize that life is more than just those things. That you can have an adventure through it all and that friends are so important and that you need to cherish friendships and enjoy them to the fullest before everyone goes their separate ways. This is a movie that I would recommend anyone watch. Live life to the fullest, have an adventure and don't let life pass you by. I am definitely planning on watching this film again in the near future. Hopefully I can better describe the feeling it gives me when I do.",positive
The Light Between Oceans,"What do we do when we encounter a situation where there is no definitive correct course of action? Do your own motivations overtake your moral compass? Most of us are fortunate enough never to be tested in this manner. Until we have each faced such challenging decisions it is impossible to know how we might react. There are no good guys or bad guys. No winners or losers. Just those left to deal with the outcome. I know this completely as I am one of the characters in this story. It is not a story for the faint of heart. If you are emotionally mature enough to withstand an in depth examination of your soul, then give this film a go. It will challenge you.",negative
The Light Between Oceans,"This film tells the story of a married couple living in a remote lighthouse, who finds a drifting boat in the sea with a healthy baby and a dead man inside. They raise the baby as their own, but soon moral challenges arise and they find themselves at an important crossroad.I'm impressed by how beautiful ""The Light Between Oceans"" is. The scenery is so beautiful that it makes me want to visit that place and feel its serenity. The pain of the couple and their reasons for making such a decision is well portrayed in the film, and I do feel for them for having live with the consequences of their wrongs. The story is really beautiful because it is a story of love, and paradoxically tells that sometimes the right thing to do may not be the right thing to do. It is so hard to determine what is right and what is wrong in this situation, thereby creating a conflict which keeps the film captivating. I'm deeply moved by both Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander's performances. The film haunts me after it finishes, and I'm still affected by it and ruminating about it.",positive
Tall Girl,As a 6'2'' female this is highly unrealistic. People are not this shallow. This movie made it seem that being tall was a disease. Ridiculous.,negative
Tall Girl,"I don't see the hate for this movie. It surely wasn't Oscar worthy, but I felt it touched on real feelings most tall girls can relate to. I was about Jodi's height at that age and there were moments during the movie that I cried like a baby, especially when Jodi finally accepted herself. I'm now 25, 6'3, married to a 5'9 man, and am having my third child. I also didn't get offended with the c-section comment and I'm about to have my third one. I think it's a beautiful movie that perhaps only a handful of people can actually relate to.Spoilers:Seeing Jodi go to her dad by the piano made me bawl. I see the insecurities my husband faces when he realizes one day his daughters surpass him in height. They'll always be his babies and I felt the movie touched on that beautifully.I think the movie did a great job depicting confidence coming from a man and not a man's height. This was shown with Jodi's father ready to fight for her for being stood up and her friend getting into a fight while defending her. It's obviously not about the fighting, but about the confidence and protect-fullness that comes from a man of any stature. This one's not just about the tall girl, but also about the short guy. It personally took me years to realize this until I met my husband.The movie also points out jealousy and insecurities in everyone. The fact of the matter is, no one is perfect and everyone has something about themselves they don't like.",positive
Warm Bodies,"This reviewer was drawn into an early screening designed to generate buzz concerning the worth of the same, so I suppose my end of the deal is to afford such. With this firmly in mind, well - so be it! I rather liked the promotional trailer, drawn as I was to the wry tone and unlikely re-imagining of the zombie genre even as I care little for horror or gore. Fear existed that the premise wouldn't be exploited to the full or that the film would register across just the bits shared in the preview. Such anxieties were misplaced for the film proved consistently entertaining throughout and perhaps better than expected.Much relies upon the capacity of the viewer to accept if not celebrate the understated tone of what is nevertheless an over-the-top zombie picture. The voice over narration provided to us by the 'R' character, affording calm, matter of fact reportage concerning the 'lived experience' of being one of the undead; i.e. charting meaningless time spent will either connect or not connect, where I was pleased to note that the audience in attendance quietly gathered and enjoyed many a little nuance presented for our collective delectation. No one could help by find the tone and direction of this pleasant lark of a date movie anything less than winning. Expect to have a nice time.",negative
Warm Bodies,"In a post-apocalyptic United States of America, the survivors live in a city surrounded by walls that separate them from the living dead. Their leader Grigio (John Malkovich) sends a group of teenagers, including his daughter Julie (Teresa Palmer), her boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco) and her friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton), to the outside to collect food and supplies for the population. However, they are surprised by a group of zombies. Among them, R (Nicholas Hoult), who is a young zombie without recollections but very introspective.R eats Perry's brain and revives his memories and sensations with Julie, and he falls in love with her. R saves Julie from the other zombies and hides her in the plane where he lives. Along the days, they develop a weird relationship and become friends. When a group of zombies led by R's friend M (Rob Corddry) finds Julie, R protects her. Soon the zombies including R change their emotions and are capable to dream. But the fearful Bonies are seeking out Julie and R to eat them.""Warm Bodies"" is a movie that combines comedy with romance, horror and action genres. The story is brainless since the very beginning; for example, a group of teenagers go to a dangerous environment without any skilled soldier to help them. But the delightful story is worthwhile; the zombie with existential crisis is adorable; Julie comparing R with the cover of Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie"" in Blu-Ray is cult; the chemistry and the romance are adorable and in the end I loved this cute movie. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Meu Namorado é um Zumbi"" (""My Boyfriend is a Zombie"")Note: On 01 May 2019, I saw this film again.",positive
A Ghost Story,"Alright. I confess. I am an emotional person. After seeing the Plugged In review for this film, I cautiously threw this movie in on a slow, Saturday night. I assumed that it was going to be much like the movie ""Ghost,"" and that it would be good, but not overly amazing. I was so wrong.Not only did this movie make me cry for most of its duration, but it literally made me sob so hard that I was afraid of waking up the rest of my family is I cried in my bedroom at 11:45 at night. The film just hits so close to home. Time is the enemy of everyone. There's no going back, and there's no stopping it either. People pass, relationships end, romances form and then break apart. Nothing, at least in our physical world, ever stays the same. This movie beautifully illustrates this in a way that most American audiences don't seem to be understanding, which is why I am writing this review.This movie deserves so much more recognition that it currently has; especially on this site. While this is by no means an action-packed or on-the-edge-of-your-seat film, the pure amount of artistry and raw, unadulterated emotion found in it makes stand out in my mind as one of the best films I have ever seen.It's so simple. So astronomically simple; and that's what makes it so magical. Whether it be the haunting image of a wrecked car or the heavily-spoken about scene depicting a woman eating an entire pie for over five minutes, every single shot is filmed with so much emotion, it makes you want to pause the film and reflect on every minute the story has to offer. Everything has a purpose in this film. It all ties together in this beautiful, haunting tragedy mixed with a love song.I know I'm just a kid. Yes, I may be only seventeen. But I beg you, if the reviews for this film on this site are making you think twice about seeing this, just listen to what I have to say and watch it. No, it's not for everyone. If you're looking for a horror movie or a blood-splattered motion pic, skip this one over. But if you're deeper than that, and you actually want to experience something you won't forget, throw yourself into this one. It's sad to see that this beautiful masterpiece of American cinema is being so overlooked.",negative

The Duff,"Another contrived American teen coming-of-age claptrap movie. There is no story attached to this whatsoever. In scene A, our heroine is a petite, photogenic, pretty girl whose appearance is dumbed down by flat makeup, flat shoes and tomboy clothes. We just know that by scene Z she is going to have a prom dress on, killer heels and a face full of blusher and red lipstick as she swans off into the moonlight with the school football captain. This is not a spoiler, it's just so obvious from the get-go. To cap it all, her name is Bianca, which apparently translates into American teen-speak as Bionka? WTF kind of name is Bionka??Do yourself a favour and give this the body-swerve.",negative
The Duff,"Fortunately the trailer teaches us what DUFF means because otherwise no one would know. It's that approachable guy in your group of friends who no one cares about but is useful for inter-group communications. You didn't ever know anyone like that? Me neither, go figure. But, as a film mechanic it works.Remember all that teen anxiety you used to have? Still got it? Yep me too. You're only comfortable with the people you know but how do you get to know someone new? If you're in touch with that feeling then this movie that explores awkward teenage romance will appeal.There are more laughs in this than the average teen movie. The characters are explored a bit more fully than in the average teen movie. It is a better than average teen movie.",positive
Werk ohne Autor,"LIVES OF OTHERS Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck has returned with another superb drama using the arts as a backdrop to show the difficult 20th century history of the German people (Henckel von Donnersmarck famously got side-tracked with a disastrous Hollywood film, THE TOURIST starring Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie - it satisfied nobody save for the Golden Globes).NEVER LOOK AWAY takes a long look at the 30 years between the rise of Nazism to the flowering of modern democracy in the 1960s. It's filtered through the eyes of a budding artist named Kurt Barnert (played by three actors, but, chiefly by Tom Schilling). The movie begins with young Kurt attending an exhibit of so-called 'Degenerate art' in 1938 with his loving, if troubled, Aunt Elisabeth (Saskia Rosendahl). WWII soon breaks out, and Kurt's Aunt is dispatched to an institution. The Barnert family ends up on the East German side of the Cold War. It is behind the Iron Curtain that artist freedom gets stifled once anew. It leads Kurt and his love, Ellie (Paula Beer, who bears a striking, and not coincidental, resemblance to Kurt's beloved Aunt) to escape to West Germany.Henckel von Donnersmarck, who also wrote the screenplay, takes a novelistic approach to the material. At 168 minutes, patience is a necessity. But, the brilliance of the movie is that it doesn't feel indulgent. Rather, the nuances and symbolism feel of a piece. The cinematography by the great Caleb Deschanel (THE NATURAL, RIGHT STUFF) is expansive, but, in service of the story. The score by Max Richter, too, is artistic, without being showy. NEVER LOOK AWAY's true theme is the pursuit of artistic freedom - and, truth (the title refers to something his Aunt tells him about never looking away at reality - harsh as it may be). While there is no question that the movie crosses over into melodrama, its underlying authenticity isn't. The large cast is excellent, including the two main leads (Beer is particularly exceptional), but to the smallest of roles.The story is inspired by modernist artist Gerhard Richter, who went through a similar life of turbulence and success (including the forced institutionalizing of a close Aunt). Richter is one of the subjects interviewed in the recent documentary THE PRICE OF EVERYTHING. In it, Richter still expresses his artistic ideal: Art should be in museums, and not in the hands of the wealthy few. Henckel von Donnersmarck's movie is a worthy expression of that idealism. It's also one of the year's best movies.",negative
Werk ohne Autor,"I am reluctant to write my review of this film, only because I fear I won't do it justice. This film is a masterpiece of the first order. According to Wikipedia, it received a 14-minute standing ovation when it was first shown at a European film festive. I can testify that it received a 14-minute standing ovation in my living room.We follow a small circle of characters through approximately 30 years of tumultuous history. We are intensely interested in the fate of each of them. There is humor, pathos, agony, exhilaration, discovery, closure, wonder, and astonishment in every scene. The acting is astounding, as is every other aspect of movie making. Bach's beautiful ""Sheep May Safely Graze"" is used throughout the movie; ironically, of course, because in Hitler's Germany, the sheep were not safe.My life has rarely been changed, set on a new path, by a film, but I can say this one has done it. I wish the same for you. Watch it over a period of two days, because you probably won't be able to take it all in in only one.",positive
Two Mothers,"I'm okay with watching a movie about selfish, sex-obsessed characters with no redeeming qualities whatsoever (i.e. Wolf of Wall Street; American Psycho) BUT it has to come from an honest place within the story and not a contrivance the writer thought would be cool because it's taboo. Every moment, every beat of this movie is forced and it's a shame because Naomi's and Robin's performances are breathtaking but the journey their characters take lead them right back to square one. They learn nothing at the end and it seems the only reason this film was made was to get a rise out of audiences. --Spoilers past this point--Two best friends (who may or may not have gone past first base when they were little girls) grow up, marry, and have children. Now, I'm assuming they led a life in all that time. They dated boys during their teen years, had a vigorous sex life, settled down, married, had kids, and carried on with their professional careers. But the film sloppily fast forwards in time and shows the now 40-ish mothers on the beach ogling their sons surfing waves as if they've never seen them before or in a half-dressed setting. Maybe it would have worked for me if the mothers were bicoastal (however that works in Australia) and hadn't seen each other or each other's sons in years then maybe, just maybe, you could make the argument that they'd see the 20 year old sons in a different, more sexual light. But that's a big, hard, wet, tight maybe. Surprisingly, the pacing of the film is great but the stilted plot overshadows it. Why is Ian so into Roz? Is it because he's still in grieving trying to get over the death of his father? Is it because he hates his mother Lil? Is it because he's trying desperately to mask his homosexual feelings for his best mate Tom? The film never hints at any of these reasons but I feel any of these options would have been better than what we are given...which is nothing. Ian's into Roz because the script says so and thus it must be. It might be easier to answer why Roz might initially be into a Ian, a handsome young man, but after the one-night stand turns into a ""relationship"" we're never given her reasons for carrying on as she does. Wait, I forgot, we are given one reason...the script says so and thus it must be. We ARE given a valid reason why Tom sleeps with Ian's mom Lil: sexual revenge. And we are shown scenes with Lil at best rebuking Tom's advances and at worst hesitantly accepting them, but after their one-night stand it never makes sense why Tom continues with the relationship when Lil was never on his radar to begin with and he could easily sleep with any girl his age without even trying. Ian slips Roz sexual glances and flirts with her by sharing a cigarette right before they partake in their dalliance. This never happens with Tom and Lil. Therefore, I am left to presume Tom only meant to sleep with Lil because he wanted to get Ian angry and make him feel the same pain he felt. But, alas, Tom's plan backfires because he actually falls in (temporary?) love with Lil. Why? Because the script says so and thus it must be. In the end, what we are left with are two couples who can't see past their own genitals to recognize the pain they are inflicting upon their innocent children and spouses (aka insufferable, unforeseen, insignificant others). I'm perplexed as to the reasons why the writer/director Anne Fontaine wished to make this film. Something tells me it was for ""selfish"" reasons. Maybe Anne was personally going through something and wanted to explore the end result through this fiction. I hope she found her answer because I certainly didn't.",negative
Two Mothers,"A fascinating, intellectual and profound exploration of the psyches of four uniquely damaged characters: two boys who never quite left the womb, growing up in a small and affluent community far removed from reality, with one father figure MIA, the other passive and disconnected, and only their mothers for comfort and company; and two women, who never conquered their fears of aging or their struggles with self-esteem and sexual confidence, and whose intimate love for each other and need to feel young and desired manifest themselves in dangerous liaisons with each other's sons. The premise is disturbing and unrealistic but a major strength of the film is that the characters' actions feel believable and understandable: but never condoned or really condemned. We are given such insight into their island-like community, their lifestyles, their dynamics and their psyches that it's perfectly clear why they fall into these simultaneously symbiotic and parasitic relationships. There is a nuance and an apathy to the directing that encourage the audience to focus more on the ""how"" and ""why"" rather than the ""what."" The film is never sexy or erotic because there is so much loneliness, pain and desperation in the sex scenes. The ocean metaphors strengthen the storytelling but never overwhelm it, and there is one particularly profound scene when Watts and Wright's granddaughters are lifted out of the very water that pulled them under and destroyed them. The film lags around the mid-point, once the quartet has fallen into a rhythm and so there is no more conflict or tension, but picks up again once their group dynamic and Watts' character's happiness are threatened. The ending is disconcerted and unexpected, but on reflection, given the film's themes and the characters' self- destructiveness, it couldn't have convincingly ended any other way. Wright and Watts do career-best work here (people who think Watts is often overwrought will like her here, I think) - both give understated but incredibly complex performances and create living, breathing, three- dimensional people out of these initially unbelievable women. Their guilt, neediness and agony are ever-present in their eyes even as the characters try to remain composed and rational. The boys aren't given as much to do but Xavier Samuel perfectly captures the confidence and faux-invulnerability of adolescence. It's also the first time Watts has laughed on screen in what must be years now, which is nice to see!Overall, in spite of some silly dialogue, it's riveting, labyrinthine, and unique - it's been a very long time since an English-language film explored female sexuality and psychology as intimately and impartially as this one does. It feels more at home with 90's French dramas like La belle noiseuse and La cérémonie than it does in 2013. I'm not entirely surprised it's received such a hateful and crude reaction online, but it has a lot more to offer than a controversial setting, and I hope audiences will be able to look past the premise and see it not as an ""issue film"" but as the perceptive and devastating character study that it really is.",positive
Gräns,"The fact that it was so bizarre, I can cope with. I like bizarre, but the thing that lost me was the baby-raping angle. It's completely unnecessary to drive the plot forward. Vore could have been guilty of any number of terrible crimes to convince the viewer that Tina could not morally coexist with, and they chose ""selling stolen children into baby-raping human trafficking rings"". They picked the worst, most disgusting crime possible for no reason, in my opinion, other to be shocking and edgy. It's so deliberately ""the worst thing you can possibly think of"" that it literally ruins the movie for me.

She is also a daily target for bullying and snarky comments because of her looks (Tina was born with a facial disfiguration). Enter Vore, who not only looks a lot like Tina but acts like her and is surprisingly smug about it. He crosses the border frequently and keeps leading her off target with his own strange sensibilities, disrupting Tina's life. But there is something about Vore that attracts her too. ""There is nothing wrong with you,"" Vore tells her. ""If there is something different, it is because you are better."" As her confidence grows, the border between Tina and herself diminishes. So do her defenses. Who is this man, and who is she?!Border is a charming, unpredictable and extraordinary film that revolves around psychological insight and fantasy. The story telling is extremely well done and the character actors are excellent. It is full of delightful, even if unsettling, surprises. I loved that Tina had a good heart and was connected to the natural world and animals, often traveling to waterfalls, hiking in the forest and swimming in lakes night and day. A favorite at Cannes.

Café Society,"F. It is a complete failure. Hands down, the worst film he's ever made. Embarrassing. Pathetic. 713 cinematic clichés strung together almost at random, many of them ones he himself coined 40 years ago. Here are the same jokes perpetrating Jewish stereotypes, harping mothers, facial characteristics, Spinoza, waffling intellectuals, the same unattainable romantic ingenues falling unbelievably for a schlep (two in this case), the same pristine crowd-free dusky Manhattan skylines, now visible perhaps only in three locations if a filmmaking permit is granted, the same madcap scenes thrown in to distract from a weak, predictable story to keep you awake at Woody's arthritic nostalgia party, the same visually untranslatable but wholly textual old jokes. Here is Jesse Eisenberg looking almost - and sounding exactly - like a young Woody, a mannered performance, no doubt another of the director's self-worshipping tongue-in- cheek inside-seeking jokes. If that doesn't work, there's Woody himself opening the film and interrupting it every so often in a weary, zombie-like voice-over sounding oddly like Al Sharpton to explain to the viewer the point of what his writing and editing is incapable of realizing. Poor Woody has become a senile old man playing chopsticks on an out-of-tune piano, trapped in his own legend and incapable of a single new idea. If you remember Woody's great films, do yourself a big favor and don't see this: it'll be almost impossible to remember him well afterwards. It's sad to see great artists - and there are others - compulsively make fools of themselves late in life. Someone needs to rescue his dignity from his overpowering myopia, or he may crash into the mirror and cut himself badly. Allen's strong suit has never been self-awareness, only self- consciousness. Here is a film that surely almost everyone over 70 living within two blocks of East 70th Street and 3rd Avenue in Manhattan can relate to. There must be dozens. Think Grandpa in Depends crashing your teenage daughter's pajama party.",negative
Café Society,"At eighty years young, Woody Allen delivers his forty-sixth (yup, you read that right) feature film with Café Society; a bourbon basked narrative feature showcasing the wonderfully vibrant jazz era of the 1930's, where the magic of the movies is very much alive; nightclubs are bustling with life, traces of the gangster underworld are closer than ever and love is a feeling as whimsical as ever in a parallel tale spanning from Hollywood to New York City.After forty-six films, you would think, with a director and writer as aged as most of our grandparents, the dialogue and writer of such an iconic filmmaker would lose his touch, but Allen proves his newest feature is as fresh, fun and fantastic as could be. Self-aware and self-absorbed as ever, the auteur extraordinaire showcases some of his most subtle and subdued screenplay to date, focusing mostly on performance from his very young cast and indulging in the beauty of a lively era within the very social elite of Hollywood and New York City.Like any good Allen film, the story follows a very unsure and adventurous young man by the name of Bobby Dorfman, played perfectly by the nerdy and always lovable Jesse Eisenberg. Bobby, who has chosen for a change of scenery from his native New York City life, decides to chance life on a whim, and join his highly successful and famed uncle Phil Stern (Steve Carell), a Hollywood agent and grande opportunist for a lavish life in Hollywood. Reluctant to really give his nephew a chance, Uncle Phil caves and leaves Bobby in the hands of his angelic and innocently beautiful secretary and assistant Vonnie, played elegantly by Kristen Stewart. Taken by her beauty at first site, Bobby and Vonnie begin experiencing the city of angels through the eyes of glamour and glitz, essentially discrediting the city and its inhabitants as a whole, and wishing for a life that is half Hollywood, and half urban paradise.As the relationship between Vonnie and Bobby intensifies, despite Vonnie having a secretive relationship with another married man, the two share some of the most memorable meet-cute dates seen this year on screen.The heart of Café Society relies heavily on the relationship and chemistry between Eisenberg and Stewart, who, luckily for audiences, have played love interests twice before in Adventureland and American Ultra. By now, while watching Café Society, one of the most frustrating elements of the film is why the two stars haven't began dating outside of the narrative of the films they star in. Eisenberg's quirk matched with the mysteriousness and nonchalant attitude of Stewart, make the two and quintessential non-Hollywood/Hollywood couple.As life complicates itself, as all matters of the heart do, Bobby soon finds himself back in the big Apple, eventually succumbing to his big brother Ben (Corey Stoll) and managing a somewhat legitimate business in Le Tropical, a nightclub owned by Ben, among other very illegal and gangster business endeavours. Stoll, who dons a full head of hair as the fiery and ruthless gangster brother to Bobby, brings forth the charm and wit he did as Ernest Hemingway in Allen Midnight In Paris. An Allen alum, Stoll provides the film with some of its most expected comedy, yet is pitch-perfect as the tough guy older brother who knows no life other than the life of the streets.Allen, who uses many of the same actors over in his films, Stoll twice, Eisenberg twice, Posey, Sirico and company, relies on his actors to deliver some of his most entertaining, fun and light-hearted material to date. Café Society is a fun, summerlicious filled romantic comedy with perfect instances of quirky dialogue and narrative that uses the beautiful jazz music as a mosaic of forbidden love and second chances.While Café Society may not be the huge commercial success of other summer blockbuster films, the film is easily one of my favourite films of the year, delivering a true cinematically entrancing experience, much like Allen's Midnight In Paris. If there is one thing I would recommend this summer season, its to make sure to watch this film by any means necessary. Café Society proves again that, like many good comedies, most are written by sadistic comedy writers, and while Allen's newest is far from sadistic, the film is an examined portrayal of an era of the golden days of cinema that brings back the golden, and leaves the rust behind. Sure, Allen can be completely self-absorbed with his films, making sure his unique cinematic voice is heard and quirkiness felt wholeheartedly, but, regardless of all that, I absolutely fell in love with this film. And while love is not rational, you fall, and lose control, which is the exact same feeling I had when leaving the cinema for this film.",positive

Hot Summer Nights,"I was lucky enough to catch this film at SXSW this year, and was blown away by every aspect of it. It's perhaps one of the most stylish and confident directorial debuts I've ever seen- director Elijah Bynum and his collaborators are firing on all cylinders here with beautiful cinematography, a knockout script that isn't afraid to slow down for thoughtful, character-driven moments, and stellar acting across the board. Timothee Chalamet is the obvious standout here, and his transition from innocence to intimidating criminality is believable and chilling. Bynum has a sense for the cinematic ""moment""- two characters sharing a lollipop in a convenience store in an extreme close-up, for example- that brings to mind the works of some of cinema's greatest directors. In conjunction with all this is a dynamite soundtrack and a unique sense of style that I look forward to seeing more of in Bynum's future work.",positive
Fruitvale Station,"I wrote one of the first reviews here of this film and it was removed before it became impossible for supporters of Oscar Grant to have such a large number of unbiased but negative reviews taken down simply because they weren't liked. It had nothing to do with the film and was purely a political move. It seems that at the time of my first review there was a movement that this thing get a major award! So I submitted another review that is even more negative than my initial one because I had more time to consider this awful movie. It's simply a totally biased and rather amateurish film that twists facts to fit the political message of those involved in its production. Both badly written and poorly directed, the incidents depicted are presented in ways that are not accurate and unfair to both sides of the issues. That being said, the acting is actually rather passable and those playing significant roles are quite earnest in their work in spite of the stereotypical characterizations in the script. Kevin Durand as the personification of evil, the BART officer involved in the shooting, is an absolute standout. He has absolutely no redeeming qualities and is almost satanic in the film. However, the film has little to say for itself and is a big disappointment. It depends far too much on sensationalism and pure controversy to carry it along rather than presenting an interesting interpretation of a real-life event. Much too preachy and superficial overall and those are tremendous understatements.",negative
Fruitvale Station,"I knew nothing about the true story behind this film before I saw it but Ryan Coogler did an impressive job of telling this controversial story. Coogler takes us to the last day in 2008, and introduces us to Oscar Grant's life. A young, troubled father that is trying to do the right thing by his family. This was his debut at Sundance and he didn't disappoint. The audience laughed when the actors laughed and shed tears when the actors shed tears...it was a very moving film. By the end of the film I felt as though I knew these people personally. The whole cast did an excellent job! I'm looking forward to hearing more about Ryan Coogler in the future.",positive
Aloha,"I have no idea what I just watched. It was so disjointed and random it made no sense. The story line, well, there was no single story line and the hodgepodge of back stories contributed nothing. Emma Stone, lily white, was supposed to be 1/4 Hawaiian and another 1/4 Asian, what a casting FIASCO. The Hawaiian lure added nothing to this sinking (stinking) ship either.I can NOT think of a single reason for anyone to watch this movie other than the same reason I watched it, to see if it was as awful as it was portrayed to be, IT WAS! It's kind of like rubbernecking at an accident on the freeway, you shouldn't, but you must!",negative
Aloha,"This isn't really a rom-com. It's the story of a broken man trying to pick up the pieces after a contractor-deployment injury left him 18 broken bones; there's a line in the plane in the first few minutes that indicate he might have lost more, which changes the entire story and nature of possible romantic encounters. Romantic attachment is part of the story but it's way more serious than rom-com. The kind of comedy isn't as light as the ""com"" in ""rom- com"" either.It's a strong film with a light mystical side to it, courtesy of a magical child-character and Emma Stone's character.Peripherally it sheds light on the privatization of the military, and gives the viewer in inside view of Air Force culture in a place cut off from the mainland.The acting is solid, the plot is inextricable from the setting, and there is a pretty clear plot.",positive
Tammy,"Frankly Melissa is laughing all the way to the bank. I thought the movie was funny in places poignant in others. I would see it again easily. With all the phony, pretentious movie making, this to me just looked like fun. Fun to watch and I bet it was fun to make.Tammy starts out a minimum wage, screw up. I have seen Adam Sandler do comedy in the same vein. He is brilliant at it and so is she. Then it progresses and deals with a woman who is forced to face her issues and grow up. So there was a recovery sense to it, and for the drunken Susan Sarandon too. It was very funny and human. I love Kathy Bates, and was happy to see her in it also.So don't watch if you don't want to, but I loved it. I giggled and felt for a lost person, who starts to gain insight. All of the negative reviews really are people's opinion. Mine is I loved it!! Also it cost 2om to make and grossed 84m. She got a cut, so I am sure she loved it too...Take your negativity elsewhere, I would watch anything she did.",negative
Tammy,"The pros: Good story line, great acting, good kicks, well sequenced music. I can't see too many ways the movie could have been better.. Elements were synchronized well.it just had the right balance, it's not too fast or too slow.. but some movies are good slow and steady..There is no way this movie should go fora rating below 6.. This is what happens when you have a voting system where any tasteless bill can poop around his opinion. One of the few movies that doesn't impose itself on you.. give it a chance and enjoy..",positive
Home Again,"This movie is just a fun watch. The cast is the best part, primarily because each of the guys is so ridiculously attractive, yet Witherspoon's character is never over-powered. Each of them also has a great rapport with her and her children that is just adorable to watch. Witherspoon is a believable single mom with normal home problems, and the presence of the three young men adds love and personal support into the mix. And it works. 
This movie portrays a woman in a way that I can get behind. She doesn't date one of the young guys staying with her because she wants to recapture her youth or make someone jealous or for some other superficial reason. She is drawn to him like she would be any other man. The movie highlights, for me, how often youth and women are underestimated in movies, especially ones like these. Younger guys aren't always stupid boy toys or hot, forbidden affairs, and moms are not all Mrs. Robinson. Watch this movie for a laugh, a blush, and a somewhat fresh take on a single mom finding new love.",negative
Home Again,"Home Again is one of those movies that's easy to like and easy to forget. It's amateurish, the characters are flat and one-dimensional and the story is practically a celebration in vapidity and contrivance. Despite this, there's not a mean bone in Home Again's body. There's lightness to it. It's boring but charming in much the same way the interior of a Pier 1 is.Reese Witherspoon stars as Alice Kinney, a recently separated mother of two who has returned to her childhood home in California to start over. Her mother (Bergen) and deceased father were once considered Hollywood royalty; a fact that three young potential filmmakers (Wolff, Alexander, Rudnitsky) go positively gaga for when they meet her at a bar celebrating her 40th birthday. Blah, blah, blah the three end up moving into the guest house. The estranged husband (Sheen) shows up later making four and Reese Witherspoon tries to cobble together a life amid the chaos.Did I say chaos, I meant unrealistically utopian equilibrium. Alice and her brother-husbands seem to have little scruples about living in a house together. This is in large part because they don't display any of the negative attributes of a regular human being. Stubbornness becomes selflessness and possessiveness is painted like enamored school boy crushes. Most of the external conflicts exist despite the setup and all the internal conflicts have the undemanding clarity of a children's storybook. To top it all off we're given the comparable setting of a 30's screwball comedy, vis a vis an expansive Hollywood villa, ensuring that the prime demographic will finally have a respite from the grave, emotionally challenging story arcs of The Gilmore Girls (2000-2007).The movie takes its reverse Three's Company (1976-1984) setup exactly where you think it's going to go. At one point one of Alice's friend's muses that she has 24-hour childcare, tech support and sex all under one roof. Because the children are around, the dynamic stays as pallid and PG as it can, with focus being constantly siphoned off into unnecessary subplots. These subplots provide the few moments of character development for the three boys, but once they're living and interacting in Alice's quaint Spanish style abode, it becomes clear that the main reason for them being in this movie is to be a plot device.This is where, if you read way too much into it like I did, you get to the good stuff. If viewed through a specific lens, Home Again could be seen as an examination of modern gender relations. At 40, Alice struggles with never truly finding the complete package – a handsome man who can exhibit maturity, meet obligations, provide economic stability, and healthy emotional growth for her and her children while seeing Alice as an equal. This point is further highlighted by the fact that she idolizes her father despite him not exactly being a prize either. So instead of compromising she compartmentalizes. She fits the guys in this film into boxes of positive traits and for the most part, they fit them, at least until the plot deems this equilibrium is no longer stable.Obviously this line of thought coaxes a lot of interesting questions about masculinity, femininity and modern relationships. But using this movie as a starting point for such a discussion is like reading Tarot through McDonalds Monopoly tokens. This movie isn't Antonia's Line (1995) it's Sweet Home Alabama (2002); which is to say a fluffy and forgettable piece of popular entertainment.That said Home Again is not all that unpleasant to sit through, in large part because Witherspoon knows exactly how to move sugary confections like this. She proves effortlessly charming and despite some bad editing and awkward staging, Home Again glides on the power of her gossamer wings to give us a moderately entertaining distraction. See it if you must.",positive
The Layover,Absolutely horrible.Terrible plot. Attempt at humor: someone farting in the car and the others characters' reactions.Their hot air balloon falls on a kids birthday cake.Kate Upton is a terrible actress-she f bombs her way through the plot on one emotionless level. An absolute waste of time.,negative
The Layover,I surprisingly enjoyed this movie. Well done comedy for females. Kate Upton and Alexandra Daddario worked well together. Great comedic chemistry. This would definitely work well as a sitcom.,positive
I Feel Pretty,"Amy Schumer isn't the reason why this movie flaked so hard. It's the way the movie played out. You could have had the greatest female comedian play the same role and the cheesy comedy and appeal to biases would yield the same result. Unfortunately, I'm finding it difficult to believe the slew of 8 and 10/10 star ratings when the movie is horrible and yields an overall 4.4. We need to stop catering to political and gender ideals and allow fair criticism and in truth, this movie sucked really bad.",negative
I Feel Pretty,"Surprised to see how low the rating is for this movie. I went to see this movie when I felt like giving up on life in the hope that it would help me feel better and it did. After watching I Feel Pretty I realized it's not about what happens in my life, but how I see it. Wonderful movie I love it",positive
If Beale Street Could Talk,"I hated MOONLIGHT. That said, this film by Barry Jenkins may be even worse. The central story is good enough, but the long, slow, lifeless scenes just pile up on each other. Long, lingering looks at actors add nothing to the story and kill the pacing.The flashback narrative is ok but there are far too many scenes that go nowhere (like the loft rental scene). It's ad is the director has no idea when to yell ""cut"" and the editor doesn't edit.On top of these basic flaws, the central characters are boring. They are in love. We get it! Move on! The mother (played by Regina King) has some potential, but even her ""big scene"" (a trip to Puerto Rico) isn't that big. I don't understand the Oscar nomination for King.The real killer is that as the film moves toward a specific climax (involving the false accusation of rape and the guy's incarceration) and then pulls the rug out from under the viewer. It then tacks on a ""years later"" epilogue that drags on for another 5 minutes. We get it! Move on!No wonder this was a big flop at the box office!",negative
If Beale Street Could Talk,"A sumptuously shot, delicately layered & beautifully composed symphony of love, hope, tragedy, sacrifice & communal bonding, If Beale Street Could Talk is a pure, poetic & passionate piece of work from Barry Jenkins that presents the filmmaker making terrific use of his skillset to deliver yet another emotionally resonant fable.The story follows a young African-American woman whose life takes a tragic turn after her fiancé is wrongfully arrested for a crime he didn't commit. With the couple expecting their first child, she races against time to prove his innocence and seeks support from her family who help her throughout her pregnancy and with the case.Fresh from his Academy Award-winning Moonlight, writer-director Barry Jenkins translates James Baldwin's novel on the film canvas with honesty & authenticity, thus making sure the story's essence remains in tact. Each scene is crafted with care & compassion, and the resulting imagery from that is rich in both colours & emotions.From a technical standpoint, If Beale Street Could Talk is sophisticated filmmaking throughout. The images aren't just gorgeously rendered but are more than capable of narrating the entire story without any verbal exposition. The unhurried pacing is deliberate yet may not appease all while Nicholas Britell's stirring score is as fitting as it is emotionally evocative.Coming to the performances, the film packs a reliable cast in Kiki Layne, Stephan James, Regina King, Colman Domingo, Brian Tyree Henry & Ed Skrein, and none of them falter in their respective roles. Layne & James play the young couple and share a heartfelt chemistry on screen. Skrein is easily detestable as the racist cop. And King leaves her own mark with a solid input.On an overall scale, If Beale Street Could Talk is an amalgamation of polished direction, sincere writing, arresting photography, mesmerising score & committed performances that manages to be heartwarming & heartbreaking in equal doses, and finds Barry Jenkins channeling his creative energy to give expression to his African-American legacy through the eyes of a young couple, their families & their lives.",positive
