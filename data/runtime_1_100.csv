The Human Race,"i'm honestly just writing this because of the high score and 2 rave reviews obviously written by people involved with the project. i feel like i was duped into watching it. so here's an honest review: this is a terrible movie. it's poorly written, and badly acted. only exception is the deaf girl. she wasn't bad, given the material she had to work with. it's just lazy filmmaking, seems like. says nothing about the human condition (as purported from the existing reviews), only the sophomoric insight of a film-school reject who saw one too many eli roth movies. seriously, avoid at all costs.",negative
The Human Race,"The first thing you need to know about this film is that it is low- budget, funded by a kickstarter project and it doesn't have a single person in it that is known in the movie world. That being said, this film is a brilliant indie that deserves to be in the spot-light. Smart, creative, well-made and seriously dark and disturbing, The Human Race restores my faith in filmmaking and the movie industry. Although this film is not for the film-goer who can only see films with bloated budgets and celebra-whores, the movie goers that do appreciate a film that takes risks and takes the honest yet disturbing route of displaying characters in ways that you're definitely not use to seeing, you will love and appreciate this film as much as I did. This film takes the classic Battle Royale storyline and pulls it deeper into the horror genre by showing a much darker side of the survival of the fittest as well as creating imagery that borders on comic book fantasy. Setting aside the awesome storyline and the genius way in which the film tells the tale, the director/writer respectfully showcases characters that are disabled yet are the strongest competitors and yet are also the weakest. I am in serious awe of this film and I hope others will enjoy it and see it for what it is as much as I do.Please like me on Facebook!

Redirected,"This was one of the worst high rated movies I've ever seen. Made me so mad, I gave it rating 1, just because it was so overrated. I mean 8,7 from 12.000 users? Have you actually seen the movie before you rated it? I read somewhere this is the first Lithuanian movie to be accepted internationally. Well, if it means this is the first Lithuanian movie I've ever seen, then it's probably right. It's a Guy Ritchie meets Emir Kusturica. The acting is very thin, though. It's full of Eastern Europe clich√©s, but it's so overt, it's not even funny. I knew what to expect in each of the following dialogues 10 minutes into the movie. I fast forwarded through certain parts.In conclusion, if you want to see a bad ass, fast-cut, violent Brit movie, go see the Snatch. If you want to see an Eastern European movie, see the Underground. If you want to see a mix of the two, and a bad one if I might add, see this.",negative
Redirected,"I never thought that a movie with such a small budget could ever be made so well. And it's not some haunting house horror, but a full caliber of action, movie. I will not say, that it reached an A level quality, but comparing this one with other E. Velyvis previous works, ""Redirected"" is almost brilliant. The script on my opinion had few significant mistakes, but it did not stop me from enjoying the movie. Frankly, I couldn't stop crying while watching it, how funny that was from me. Though ""Redirected"" is orientated to the wider audience, I have to admit that there are some amazingly funny moments that will be understood only by a true Lithuanian (the scene with the emergency was crazy, but what is more crazy that it was actually based on a true story; or the old man in the forest making illegal hooch, witch is extremely popular in the country, I myself as a kid used to steal billets from there). The other east Europeans should also find something familiar.. :} but must not forget director uses lots of dark comedy. But overall I am pretty sure the West world will also enjoy the movie very much. They too will be able to recognize them self and how they look in the eyes of east ;] You know what, I can't wait to see it again.",positive
Beta Test,"After seeing the rating for this on here (currently at 7.0, although I suspect that will change) I thought that this might actually be really good.But uhm, let's just say I think the director have a lot of good friends who are kind with their ratings.It's not completely awful, but it's not that great either.I've always liked Larenz Tate so it's cool to see him in something new, so there is always that, and he hasn't aged a day in 20 years (he's 41 believe it or not).He plays a gamer who's been given a beta version of the latest game bound to conquer global fandom, and the plot is decent enough but it's just such a low-budget film and that shows in every aspect of the movie.First of all the ""game"" that he's playing looks like it's well over 10 years old, and it simply doesn't make any sense why they couldn't just use real footage in the game scenes instead. Then at least Larenz would have a clear reason to be so blown away by the details in the game.And the ""twist"" about the game of course would have made A lot more sense too.Kevon Stover is one of the bad guys, and his attempts at being so stereotypically tough would make even Hulk Hogan cringe. I suppose that could be intentional to get a bit of 90's video-game feel to the character. But yeah, he's a chippendale appearantly which doesn't come as a surprise at all.The first hour is still semi-watchable if you manage to look past the flaws but the last 25 minutes is a bit of a drag to say the least.",negative

The Last Exorcism 2,"Never do I rate a movie 1, and the only reason I did on this movie as there was not the ability to rate it a zero or less. The Last Exorcism Part II is a complete waste of time. It is NOTHING like other Exorcism movies, nor is even come lose to being scary. About all you get out of this is a lot of deep looking facial expressions by Ashley Bel who plays Nell. I was so disappointed in that there was nothing really scary, some possessed people who just talk scary, yet the demon is never really there. The scenes were so disjointed, and after 30 minutes, I felt like OK, this has gone so slow up until now, something really scary is going to happen next... I was mistaken. After 45 minutes, I waited, after an hour, I waited, then figuring that this was going to be a great and scary ending.. I waited.. Then the credits roll! ARE you freaking kidding me? This has to be the G rated version of scary movies of all time. Like another review hit on, the only reason it seems that this movie was made was to pry money from those that saw the first movie and thinking this will be a continuation of that. Here is the fact of life, if you go see this movie thinking it is a scary or demonic movie, the Joke will be on you as the movie maker laughs all the way to the bank.",negative
The Last Exorcism 2,"Unlike so many others (general audience not critics) I count my self a fan of the original Last Exorcism. I found the film to be throughly engaging. Funny with some creepiness and a burst of disturbing at its unexpected if slightly hammy conclusion. The no. 1 thing I loved about that film was Cotton the Reverend, the second thing Nell played by Ashley Bell in a physically daunting, creepfest performance. So when I heard they were developing a sequel I was game Because the first film had created characters that I liked. But as the release loomed closer I realized that Cotton wasn't going to be part of the mix which was a little bit of a let down. However even though the trailer looked a little silly, well a lot I wanted to give the film makers props for not going with the know annoying found footage routine and updating out main characters story to something more classically cinematic. The results are mixed but it's safe to say that there's enough to merit a soft recommendation. The film picks up the moments after the events of the original where Nell is found traumatized and brought into a girl's halfway house. Everything seems well enough at first as she begins to adjust to everyday activities. It's a little lifetimeish as she listens to her first ipod, wears some lipstick and has her first real kiss but we like the character and Bell keeps it engaging. But strange things begin to happen and we slowly but surely discovering that the demon from the original is still looking for her to fulfill a prophecy of horrific proportions. It all sounds a little generic but the way in which the material is approached is somewhat interesting because you see the demon has in fact fallen in love with her and is sort of courting her destroying the life around her. It's a n intriguing concept sadly not fully explored but hidden inside this is great one and had they had more a budget to hide this hokey effects (cartoon cgi fire ugh), A more in depth screenplay and a harder rating which would have allowed them to show more this could have been a real blast. There is potential that runs throughout the film populated by solid performances especially for the genre, some decent scares, a creepy indie atmosphere and some really nice cinematography (the shadow work is impressive). But in the end it fails to really deliver on any of its promises which is sad and with its dismal box office and a feisty finale which could have led to something pretty cool it doesn't look like we are going to see another entry. Maybe we'll get lucky and they will explore the concept further on a direct to DVD sequel. But regardless of the films faults of which there are many it's a lot better than most of the big studio crap they've been releasing like The Possession and The Apparition at least there's a story here an an intriguing one at that. 3/5",positive
The Selfish Giant,"An utterly charmless episode, the film was unlikeable as were the characters, it began with a tirade of profanity and stumbled clumsily through every 'council estate rubbish' clich√© from barely human parents who bring feral kids up by slapping them about to portraying an entire group of people as being of incredibly short tempers and even shorter attention spans, nothing but poverty porn, the kind of smug,lazy,misinformed stereotyping that nobody really believes but some still try to convince themselves on insisting is an accurate portrayal of real life. Most so called 'kitchen sink dramas' manage to portray a modicum of humanity and humour this was lacking in both, everything about it was just horrible, didn't say anything, didn't go anywhere,just a nasty dehumanisation of the working class. Awful.",negative
The Selfish Giant,"In the Giant's garden in Oscar Wilde's children's story The Selfish Giant, it is always winter. Having built a wall to keep children from playing in his garden, there are no longer any peach trees, flowers, or birds, only perpetual hail and snow. Spring has forgotten this garden as it also seems to have forgotten the industrial town of Bradford in West Yorkshire, England, the setting for Clio Barnard's authentic and visceral The Selfish Giant. Nominated for a BAFTA award for Best British Film of 2013, The Selfish Giant is in the tradition of Ken Loach, Shane Meadows and others, films of social realism that show the world there is more to merry old England than Stratford-on-Avon and Westminster Abbey.Though the film is about economic and social dysfunction, it is not all grim. Even in the metallic gray of the rotting town as captured by cinematographer Mike Eley, scenes of horses grazing in a tranquil field, oblivious to the surrounding train tracks and power lines, add a touch of timeless beauty. The real standout, however, are the remarkably convincing performances of Arbor (Conner Chapman) and Swifty (Shaun Thomas), 13-year-old best friends whose connection is born out of their desperate need for affection. Arbor, a pint-sized, hyperactive, sharp-tongued ADHD sufferer, lives with his mother (Rebecca Manley) and older brother (Elliott Tittensor) who sells his A.D.H.D. medication to pay off his drug debts. His father is nowhere to be seen.""They sleep on the living room sofas but are better off than Swifty who lives with his eight siblings in a home lacking in the means to support them. Swifty's mother played by Siobhan Finneran, is caring, though she is intimidated by her overbearing husband (Steve Evets) who supports the family by renting furniture from discount stores and selling them for cash at inflated prices."" Struggling to keep his aggressive behavior in check, Arbor relies on the heavy-set Swifty, a kinder gentler soul with a love for horses to calm him down. Banned from school as a result of fighting to defend themselves against bullies, the boys use a horse and cart to scavenge scrap metal, pots and pans, as well as copper cabling from telecom, railway, and power utilities.To earn money to help support their families, they sell the scrap to an exploitative but fatherly local junk dealer (Sean Gilder), incongruously called Kitten but given to bursts of anger. In one of the visual highlights of the film, an illegal harness drag race is run on a major highway with serious money at stake. Recognizing Swifty's way with horses, Kitten offers to let him ride one of his horses in the next race. Feeling his friend drifting away from him, Arbor concocts a potentially lucrative plan to steal or collect electrical power cables, but the adventure leads to unforeseen consequences. Much of the dialogue without subtitles is indecipherable due to the heavy Yorkshire accents, but consists mostly of non-stop swearing anyway.What does come through loud and clear, however, without the need for subtitles is the closeness of the boys' friendship. Although they have different temperaments, they are connected by a struggle for survival and a drive to preserve whatever joy is left in their childhood. There are definitely economic and political overtones in The Selfish Giant, yet it is not about politics or even selfishness, in spite of the title. It is a film with a human element at its core and we care about the characters as Barnard obviously does as well. According to the director, the film ""is about what we have lost¬Öand what we need to value and hold on to."" It is also a film about the resilience of two boys determined to avoid becoming objects like the discarded scrap they collect.",positive
Yip Man: Jung gik yat zin,"We get it, yip man, ip man, what ever the dude name is.He's a great grandmaster, a teacher of Bruce Lee (well, Bruce found another branch of martial arts long after anyway, but that's not the point), probably fought with the Japanese and stuff With all due respect to Master Ip (the real master Ip)enough with this crap please, Anthony Wong is not a martial artist, and as much as the fight look OK-ish, Eric Tsang? Come on HK Film makers, you can do better than this, give me overrated gangster love drama of the 90 or even a one man gun frenzy heroes like Chow Yun Fat Enough of this overblown Ip Man shits, you've got 4000 years of Chinese History, pick one and make a fresh story out of it.What's next? Ip man love life?Can't believe Anthony Wong would wanna do this kind of cheap movies, it's not that bad in itself, but the fact that they cheaply trying to milk every penny from the grandmaster ip itself is disgusting",negative
Yip Man: Jung gik yat zin,"The most interesting aspect between Herman Yau-Anthony Wong collaborations is that their partnership had its roots in Hong Kong Category III horror. Ebola Syndrome is still one of the most disgusting movies I have ever seen and been guiltily entertained by. Forget Outbreak or Contagion, Ebola Syndrome was a far more disturbing movie about a viral outbreak. Forget Hannibal Lecter, Anthony Wong truly played a disturbing sociopath in that movie. The point is: they're not afraid to delve into the gritty, the ugly and the disgusting.Set against the big commercial movie cog machine and the Ip Man franchise, the majority of Yau-Wong penchant for grittiness is diluted and only some of it remains in Ip Man: The Final Fight. It is that essence of the grittier and the uglier sides of Ip Man that makes out for the more interesting parts in Ip Man: The Final Fight, but it's also the film's major weakness because it never treads far enough from familiar territory.What the film ends up being more like tonally is a combination of the Wilson Yip- Donnie Yen Ip Man films and Bruce Lee My Brother, where it is loosely glossing over the details of the grandmaster's life and dramatically punching up the action so it can allow for fight scenes, but also providing a retro-gaze of Hong Kong accompanied with a celebrity guest-list cameos.For example, it's been said that Ip Man sported an opium habit. The concept is telegraphed but never truly explored. Another example is Hong Kong actor Liu Kai Chi gives a cameo as Ip Man's friend who is suffering from poverty. They start what might be a potentially interesting storyline but it never finishes itself. Much of the film is like that.There are about several subplots running through the story and they all end up as separate vignettes that do not rise above the sum of it's parts. For a biopic drama, that's a problem because it does not provide an unified narrative goal. This is not an editing issue. The story was based on Ip Chun's stories of his father and it is as if seemed like the screenwriter noted them down as told and the director literally shot them that way. So I attribute this issue to lazy writing. The retroactive voice-over device ends up killing a lot of the drama. The scene will be happening and the voice-over will cut in summing up the rest of the scene in past tense. It keeps glossing over by stating what happened instead of letting the audience experience what's happening in the now.Anthony Wong is very natural as Ip Man. He looks most like the real-life version of Ip Man and actually adopts a Foshan accent. He breathes many colors into the role and the scenes with Ip Man and his students is the heart of the film. Anthony Wong is pretty much the best thing about this movie and his performance alone is the price of admission.Eric Tsang has a great supporting role as a Crane style master who befriends Ip Man. There is a self-referential joke where Tsang says being a 'clan master' (ÁçéÈñÄ‰∫∫) is difficult, a reference to his famous television game show, that was self-serving and unnecessary. Tsang and Wong share an awesome fight together. Not a lot of people remember that Eric Tsang started out as a stuntman; the fight looks very authentic. They were really smashing their forearms together. Eric Tsang is a badass.Something I noticed about the cinematography was there were way too many crane shots in this film. There's a scene that ends on a connective moment between two characters and then it cuts to a crane shot backing away presenting a view of the entire rooftop set. I have a theory about this. In Hong Kong, booking a crane from a production house is a planned expense and usually you would require more crew members or more time to set up a crane shot. Production houses in the Mainland will give crews an entire film equipment package in their deals, which includes cranes and jibs. With the cheap labor and higher amount of crew members, a crane shot can be set up much faster in the Mainland. As a recent occurrence, a lot of Chinese productions lead by Hong Kong directors have recently been very crane shot-heavy. Hong Kong directors, this needs to stop. You have to remember to pull back every once and a while.Just as a small footnote, I really hated the Bruce Lee cameo. Playing Bruce Lee in a film is by no means an easy feat but the actor they chose was abysmally awful. He made Bruce Lee look like a rich asshole sellout. It was not fun, nor did it work as a pop culture reference.Overall, I enjoyed this film, but I do not think it works completely as a standalone piece. It seems to fit as the final piece to this whole line of Ip Man films. In a way, I can't help it because they've made so many movies about Ip Man in such a short time.With every film, I see a little more of who this man was, what his legacy was and it had me thinking about even what being a good teacher means. I still think The Grandmaster is the best Ip Man film. They really don't need to make any more Ip Man movies. And if they do (and I think they are because I saw a poster for an Ip Man 3 with Donnie Yen), please do the story with Bruce Lee and get him right.For more reviews, please visit my blog at http://hkauteur.wordpress.com/",positive
Devil's Due,"Absolute Dogsh*t is a term that cannot be used enough to describe this movie. I hated the characters (especially the tw*t of a husband), the stupid shaky-cam, the ""scares"", the pathetic sub-plot of an ancient cult, the trailer that gave away absolutely everything, and did I mention the tw*t of a husband? No doubt there'll be a sequel, and another, and another. Remember when there were actually good horror found-footage films? Me neither. Hollywood is just saturated with them, none of them good. A complete and terrible rip-off of Rosemary's Baby. Just don't watch it. If I could give it a minus rating I would. Definitely in the category of one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",negative
Devil's Due,"If you don't like ""found footage"" movies than this might not be for you but if you're okay with movies like Chronicle and Cloverfield then I think you'll really enjoy this movie. But it's more like a really sad love story than a crazy horror movie.It made me laugh a little at first and then it made me really tense and nervous. It was creepy the whole time. And I felt for the couple all the way through. They were great actors.Most people seem to write this off because it's ""found footage"" but the movie seems to flip that like Chronicle did and doesn't need the footage to have been found by anyone. I don't usually have a problem with ""found footage"" anyway and I respect the use of cameras in this because they always had cool ways to do it without explaining it to me over and over like I'm stupid, like they do in Chronicle. My friends I saw it with missed the hidden cameras getting installed and the lapel camera the husband wears and so they didn't like it but if you watch closely it's all pretty well explained.This isn't the best movie I've ever seen but it's a lot better than people say.",positive
Doua lozuri,I don't know if this film was lost in translation but I have honestly never seen such an unfunny supposed comedy. Yes I watched in English subtitles but atleast parts shouldn't be lost in translation surely. The main positive was that it didn't last all that long.,negative
Doua lozuri,"I happened to watch the movie inside the TIF film festival. I wasn't expecting much, cause it seems Romanian movies tend to follow a pattern. This was not the case, and it was such a nice surprise. A good script, with awesome dialogues and interactions. At the end of the movies the crew came to salute everyone and were opened to questions. The second surprise wasn't the fact that they were friendly and answered all the questions, but by the age of the crew and the ""lack"" of experience they said they have, even though by watching the film you would never experience is a issue. I haven't had the opportunity to watch it again, but if the opportunity appears for either of you I highly recommend you check it out. I did and made my day, Cheers",positive
Theeb,"Set during the Ottoman province of Hijaz during World War I, we meet a tribe of whom Theeb ('Wolf') is the son of the late Sheik. One night a friend arrives with a British officer seeking a guide across the desert. This turns out to be his brother's job but being an inquisitive young boy he sneaks along and so begins his coming of age.To say anymore might be a plot spoiler. This is an interesting film but it is not an action packed affair. There is a bit of action, but this is more psychological in how it deals with the extremes that befall the characters and how they deal with them. It has moments of tension and can be violent in places and I found a lot to praise in this UAE, Jordan, Qatari and British co production.In Arabic with a small amount of English, and good sub titles this is one of those films that will stay with you ‚Äì but in a good way ‚Äì recommended for World cinema fans.",negative
Theeb,"The film grabs a hold of you and does not let go until after the credits are finished rolling. The film is through the perspective of the young naive boy who has grown up in an isolated desert, he is curious, mischievous and then struggling to survive. Theeb succeeds in capturing the intelligence and the regality of Bedioun life that the Western gaze is incapable of doing. While this film is set during World War II, the war and conflicts are simply in the background, and the focus is on the tribal law and way of life of the nomadic, hospitable Bedouin. The film feels very authentic and well-researched. An epic coming of age story on boyhood, manhood, survival and code of ethics. Beautiful representation of the disappearing Bedouin way of life.",positive
Vehicle 19,"I wasn't expecting much of this film given the largely unknown cast, but it failed to meet my rock bottom expectations. The main protagonist stumbles his way through what should be a routine trip from the airport to his girlfriend's house. Firstly, he's in a strange country but has no Sat-Nav. Instead of concentrating on the road, he's eating, drinking, doing everything distracting that he can to ensure that he nearly knocks down every pedestrian in sight. Then he finds a gun in his car. What does he do? Throw it away? No, he decides because the car has a gun in it, he doesn't like it any more, and he abandons it in the middle of a dangerous South African township and starts walking!Another ten minutes, and another half dozen ridiculously ill-thought out events and we couldn't watch it any longer.

I cannot believe Paul Walker would do such a low budget film. I will not recommend it to anyone.

Ocho apellidos vascos,"Utter Tosh. A highly predictable dirge of a film taking stereotypical characters (lazy but cheerful Andalusians, defensive nationalistic Basques) and then placing them in situations to which you know exactly how it is going to finish. The comedy is supposed to be slapstick and an ironic look at the two distinct areas of Spain but it quickly becomes tedious and in places offensive. It's repetitive (proud Basque father, intimidated daughter, happy go lucky Sevillian) and would be fine as a five minute sketch. Despite this being one of the highest grossing films in Spanish Cinema, many Spanish friends of mine have also commented how ""simple"" and childish the comedy is. A case of the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" as there is nothing really here. Truly truly horrible.",negative

400 Days,"Let's cut to the chase: Avoid this movie at all costs.I don't know about the 400 days but that was most certainly 90 minutes of our lives we'll never get back.What seems initially like a good premise with unlimited possibilities it is transformed in a lame and boring Carpenter-ish c-class movie that leads nowhere.Sometimes after a slow boring movie you might get a rewarding and interesting ending, so your time spend not to feel wasted.Unfortunately this is not the case here. The ending is as ambiguous as it could possibly be.I call this type of movies ""The 3 minutes more movies"" and includes other crappy ones like ""Another Earth"". What do I mean by that 3 minutes more? I mean movies that the ending would be crystal clear if the movie lasted 3 minutes more (or at least one in this case). What happened really is a mystery only for the audience who feels cheated. The crew of the simulation will know the truth soon enough. The audience never will. It's not an ending to interpret or to start a conversation about it. It's just like they ran out of film a couple of minutes sort before the actual ending.The cast consists of likable actors including Brandon (Superman Returns) Routh but were misused. The production soon feels cheap and the pace is boring. Initially you expect something to happen but soon enough you give up and just wait for the conclusion which in this case...there isn't any.Overall: The writer and director Matt Osterman deserves at least 400 days in prison for this crap or even better his whole life far far away from cameras of any kind.",negative
400 Days,"I'm glad I didn't buy into the numerous negative reviews and purchased this film that seemed to have a very intriguing plot. I must say that I even got much more than I expected. 400 Days convinces with a gloomy and mysterious atmosphere, four distinguished and interesting main characters and a challenging plot that doesn't give you all the answers. The movie actually takes its audience serious and requests multiple viewing and the use of your brain. The number of analyses, questions and theories around the movie on the internet only underlines the film's intellectual touch.Why did the movie get so many negative reviews then? Of course, some people might just not like it. The film doesn't have any stunning special effects like so many other science-fiction films. The film didn't have a big budget and the settings aren't much developed. While the actors and actresses are doing a solid job in my book, there isn't a particularly outstanding performance and you obviously won't find any big names involved here.However, I suspect that most reviewers rated this movie down because they literally didn't understand it. You can identify those people by reading sentences like ''The movie didn't have a proper ending!'', ''How is it possible that the Moon got destroyed?'' and ''The behavior of the characters doesn't make any sense!''. The movie does have a clear ending that makes you think and that makes sense once you really think about it. The explanation that the Moon got destroyed doesn't have anything to do with what's really going on. And the characters react very emotionally because three of them are receiving drugs and because specific planned events are supposed to trigger their exaggerated reactions. I won't give any more information than this and there might be different similar interpretations of the film but it's important to understand the movie by looking at its whole essence and the things that are said in the beginning instead of taking every statement each character makes literally.If you are ready to explore a science-fiction movie with an experimental, intelligent and interpretative plot, you will be surprised by 400 Days. If you are looking for a spectacular science- fiction movie with a big budget and perfectly clear answers, you should better watch another shallow Star Wars or Star Trek sequel or stick to popcorn cinema fur juvenile minds such as Guardians of the Galaxy.",positive
Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods,"OK just to make it clear, the guys who reviewed it and gave it a 9 out of 10, aren't DBZ fans at all.I've loved that manga since early 90's, as a teenager, and loved all OVA (first broly being the best of them all) . I brought in a friend that is a huge fan too, relaxed, closed curtains, watched the movie... and we waited ; we waited for the story to skip the poor jokes and so on. Until I realised it was exactly designed the same way the previous Tarble anime was, poor humour, poor enemy's design, motivation, etc. The realisation is OK, but I really can't believe Akira Toriyama took part into that , and if so, I would be ultimately disappointed. How can people consider that to be a dragon ball movie, when there is only kawai fan service? Bills, is an absolutely empty shell character, the story is for kids. If you're over 10 , you might really be upset about this being called Dragon Ball. Only time we probably enjoyed was the overall 5-10 minutes fighting sequence, and that was really to say that something was still kind of brought back from the old DBZ and updated with today's technical improvements. So to summarize : if you're a real hardcore DBZ fan (meaning you didn't even wasted your time watching GT, as I did) , you'd better skip this movie, even if I know curiosity will prevail, but don't' have huge expectations, this is simply the WORST dragon ball movie I've ever seen. My buddy asked me seriously if that was a dragon ball parody movie or if it was real... Please Toei guys and Toriyama san , if you read that, please never do that again to your real fans. You just dealt a fatal blow to that magic manga that dragon ball is , and I'm not sure I'd go for a next movie if it's so bad. You have been warned guys.",negative
Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods,"Finally for all these days it came true, A new Dragon Ball Z Movie came up.I was so happy to hear the news for the first time, guess what? i was the one who requested and added this page to IMDb just to let the world know about the movie more and share its information as IMDb is the best for it.I love the Akira Toriyama's story in this, the battles so intense, loved watching it :D and the way story lines ended, seems as in Future we could see more of Dragon Ball Z, hoping for a new Series just like before and i am hearing rumors that there will be one? i believe there should be one as now we know there is 7 other Universe in it, wow hoping that there will be few more people like Goku who are just as or more powerful than him, Akira PLEASE WE WANT MORE!!!",positive
Ast√©rix: Le domaine des dieux,"I was a big fan of the original ""Asterix"" comic books when I was a kid. Still am, as a matter of fact. So when I came across this French computer animated adaptation of the Asterix comic book ""The Mansion of the Gods"" on Netflix, I was curious to see how well it would be done. I still remember very well the particular Asterix comic book this movie adapted, and I have to say this adaptation is pretty well done. The second half of the movie pretty much stops following what happened in the comic book in order to do its own thing (and to stretch the story to feature length), but the changes to the story do feel straight out of a typical Asterix comic book. The humor (and there's plenty of it) has the exact tone, and happens to be pretty funny. The computer graphics don't quite have the Hollywood polish, but they are colorful and acceptably detailed. The only caution I would deliver to potential viewers is to inform them that they should read some of the original Asterix comics first before watching this movie, since there are some (minor) details that might be confusing for those not familiar with the comics.",negative
Ast√©rix: Le domaine des dieux,It's everything a movie about Asterix should be.The spirit found in Uderzo & Goscinny works breathe true this movie. The subtle humor and those sweet eye winks like the authors always did in their books. The best Asterix animation to this day and trust me i've been a fan for 40 years. A total delight for the family and even for people who don't know Asterix world and the characters it will be easy to get to know them and have a lot of good laughs.I have been really please and surprise by this animation as all movies done about Asterix were not as authentic and enjoyable like this.I definitely wishing they do another one soon!!!,positive
Meet the Blacks,"My first review, and maybe my 3rd or 4th rating. 
I love the most movies and series, so I never rate them if it isn't amazing. But this movie is a waste of time. 
I saw 14 minutes and stopped it. The next day I saw 20 minutes more, just to give lt a chance but it suuuucks! It's so cringy and stupid without being funny. The cast is ok but they can't act in this movie because the script is SO terrible. Later that same day I thought ""watch the movie maybe it's ok"" but now I just wanna sue both netflix, the cast, the producers and the writers. 
Don't watch this crap it's a wate of time and your life.",negative
Meet the Blacks,At this point if you are still trying to break down a parody movie from every angle and inspect it then you are wasting your time. Parody movies are literally designed to not be a good movie. The only thing it's for is to make you laugh. Everyone knows this so why every time a new one is made people expect more? Honestly these type of movies are for people who like to laugh and usually don't care how it turns out. I understand some of you may feel if it's a theatrical release then it should be at least worth the money but it's very hard to please everyone when it comes to music and art and it has always come down to a preference thing. I am giving this a 10 out of 10 because it made me laugh the whole time and that's all these movies are made for. I expected nothing else from it and I got nothing else from it.There was no great story line or amazing actors just good Ole parody humor.,positive
"Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ""F""","If you are like me (a passionate DBZ fan who grew up diligently tuning in to every episode) then you'll be ashamed with how this latest instalment scars the legacy created during our childhood. There's getting it wrong and then there's getting it horribly incorrect and DBZ have achieved the latter with this time waster, if you asked me to describe it in 3 words they'd be 'rushed, sloppy' I know that's only 2 words but in truth this film doesn't deserve a third word, it also didn't deserve my attention for however long I spent pushing my eyes towards suicide. I can only think that this was directed and funded by people who dislike DBZ, that would describe the plot with unforgivable holes all over the place and the so called action which is dreadful and painful to watch, Goku probably needs to sue DBZ for terrible misrepresentation of his character. Anyone that says this rushed, unchoreographed, pathetic excuse of a film is good would've been paid a big fee to say so, I can honestly say the best part of this film is the credits, retire now DBZ!!!",negative
"Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ""F""","This is the Dragon Ball Z Movie experience I always wanted. While Battle of Gods was an amazingly fun light-hearted adventure, this is the badass action-packed DBZ that we wanted since the Cell Saga.Goku and Vegeta have now ascended to Gods with Whis as their new master. I absolutely loved the exploration of Goku and Vegeta's character dynamics and development throughout the training scenes, with Whis not only being a physical mentor but a spiritual one as well. Bills provides much of the comedy in his own unique manner as one of the best new DBZ Characters ever. Speaking of new characters, I'm pleasantly surprised by Frieza's new minions, especially Sorbet as he's actually useful throughout the movie and not just fodder like the rest of Frieza's army. The invasion scene was amazing as it put the Z warriors back in the spotlight and gave the movie some much-needed tension. Especially Gohan; not since his fight with Cell has he been this badass!Speaking of badassery, the very definition of the word, Vegeta, finally gets his time to really shine (there are no stupid bingo scenes in this one...) - it is straight up brawls in that over-the-top fashion we all know and love delivered by the Prince of all Saiyans.In the end, the 15th DBZ Film featured the return of the greatest Anime villain of all time: Frieza in a Battle of Gods with the Super Saiyan God Goku. It's just classic!",positive
The Canal,"After reading description on IMDb before watching this flick, thought like its kind of haunted house or another sinister like movie & i guess i was right...But if you using already used concept in your current movie, then you should be able to give something more interesting to audiences than its original version. Fortunately director & script writer tried to do so but unfortunately as end product the film wasn't that effective.Movie is horror thriller but apart from some good jump scares, it doesn't gives you much more as movie to remember. Thriller & Fear element is badly missing.Off course you can watch this movie, but even if you don't watch, you are not going to miss anything important...",negative
The Canal,"I don't know why the IMDb score and Metacritic score are so low on this one. That's one of the reasons I put off watching it for a while but I'm so glad I finally got around to seeing it; it's one of the better horror films of recent years, and I'm a huge horror junkie. If you like disturbing horror that gets under your skin and doesn't rely on jump scares or constant gore then this is for you. The film is beautifully shot and has some exceptionally creepy visuals. It's sporadically violent and cruel but every moment of blood letting or grotesquerie is expertly handled and actually frightening rather than pure gross-out. I urge you not to watch the trailer as it contains spoilers I wish I hadn't known before going into it. If you want to know what to expect, I'd say it's got elements of films such as The Shining and The Ring, but it has a very unique feel. There's a nice dose of drama along with the horror and Rupert Evans is thoroughly believable and engaging in the lead role, much more so than your average modern horror protagonist. Highly recommended!",positive
Timbuktu,"I usually get recommendations from friends who love movies, and I deliberately go into the movie ""blind"" to limit my expectations one way or another. Of course, with Hollywood blockbusters or sequels, it is hard to avoid seeing or hearing something about the film.Timbuktu is an excellent film. It draws you in with the beautiful cinematography and keeps you there with the story.Set in historically famous Timbuktu, Mali; we see that the territory has been taken over by Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) as the black standard flag of the jihadist group flys.Their rule of law is strict and adheres to their own interpretation of Shariah. They declare the prohibition of smoking, music, soccer and even hanging out around the ancient town. Their punishments severe, hard lashings. For adultery, the punishment is death by stoning. Of course, much like most power structures, the rules don't apply to the jihadists. There are many contradictions. They enter the mosque wearing shoes and guns and are promptly kicked out by the imam. One of the commanders visits a woman without her husband present. The same commander smokes regularly. To make matters worse, there is miscommunication among the local population and the jihadists. The locals speak Tamasheq and some French, whereas the jihadists mostly speak Arabic with some French and English. But the communication is not only linguistically, but culturally. At one point, a young jihadist soldier comes to propose marriage to the mother of a young Mail girl. Her mother refuses, saying she does not know the man and his proposal is improper, as her husband (the father) is not at home. Almost immediately, the man threatens to take the girl by force, which he later does. Another time, a group of young men and women play music and sing together, praising Allah. The jihadists arrest them for playing music and for the men and women being together unmarried. Tensions right hot and seem as though they could give at any moment. A good example being when various men and boys are playing soccer without a ball. As soon as a patrol comes by, they start doing stretches and exercises, immediately reverting back to the match as soon as the patrol departs. The tensions between the imam and the jihadist leadership are another interesting thread in the story.Give this film a look, you won't be disappointed and it provides key insight to the challenges terrorist groups put on local communities.",negative
Timbuktu,"I saw many excellent films at The Toronto Film Festival. This one really stayed with me. I am not a person who can tolerate visually violent movies and this move respected me as an audience member. I cannot remember a movie with more captivating images which resonated, characters I continue to think about and visuals which prompted me to reconsider my relationship with history and other nations as well as with myself. That sounds kind of major. Suffice to say that I recommend this movie to anyone who would like an excellent story simply told which is both moving and a window on another world. The story is about creeping fascism and the way in which human beings resist heroically inroads against them which demean them. Despite the heavy subject matter, I found this film incredibly uplifting. This is a rare opportunity to see a film which depicts the complicated and sometimes frightening world we live in but with a sense of hope.I tend to be a rom-com type. It surprised me to relish a film about war. It is not a film without heartache. It is a film which is both inspired and is inspiring. Most of the lead characters are not professional actors. This shocked me. I cry to remember some scenes, but with gratitude!",positive
The Possession of Michael King,"This review may not contain a spoiler, but I ticked it anyway. This is a cheaply made, badly acted and scripted, possible student film.It is completely unoriginal, except for the fact that the main character purposely tries to become possessed as opposed to unknowingly. This may be because of his wife accidentally dying, but it's never made clear why, seem to be just an experiment he's performing on himself, out of depression maybe, we don't know, he seems fairly chipper in the beginning. Since when do things happen for a reason in C grade films? He has a young daughter still living with him, but he continues on his course of trying to become even more and more possessed, till he gets out of control, trashes the house, and his sister takes his kid off him. The talking was too quiet, then sound effects were way too loud and abrasive, trying to maintain their cheap 'jump' scares that always fell flat. People connected with the film have once again inflated the scoring, it's definitely a one star film, avoid this poor excuse of a movie.I would like to offer a way it could have been better, but the story and plot were weak, the acting was weak, writing was dull, the look of the film was not consistent yet the settings were pretty much all in the house. The grave scene with the priest, that kinda went in another direction there where he was getting teeth sewn into his belly to summon the spirit of a dead corpse. Then it was back to the house for the rest of the film till its inevitable end. Please stop making this type of complete crap, conning the general public to rent or buy it, nobody in the real world would rate this stinking movie, nobody.",negative
The Possession of Michael King,"Just finished watching this movie. I didn't think I would like this film at all and almost turned it off right at the start because I read its similar to the blair witch project and paranormal activity. I watched this late at night on my own in the dark so conditions for viewing this type of film were pretty good. The film didn't disappoint. It's very intense, fast moving and quite scary. This film was the exact opposite to what I was expecting. I thought it was going to be a waste of 90 mins like 80% of horror films. I couldn't fault anything about the movie. Very impressive work by Yung and whoever else was involved. Acting all round was top notch. Well, give it a shot. I doubt many will be disappointed.",positive
Scenic Route,"What do ""Buried"", ""Phone Booth"", ""Panic Room"", ""Misery"", ""The Mist"", etc. etc. etc. have in common? Well, they are all one-room set movies, and they are all very entertaining. Scenic Route is also a one-room set movie. What not in common with the letter movies? That ""Scenic route"" is not entertaining, it's tedious and not worth the watch, it is nothing more then 82 minutes brambling about the same thing.Reading the first 10 reviews I was quite excited to see this movie, but wow, a 82 minutes discussion about Michell married a secretary and how wrong Carter thinks that is, is just unbearable to watch. Fantastic desert scenes? Perhaps for those that have never visited a desert themselves, not only the movie was an el-cheap o production, the desert also. The only good thing about this movie was that it was not longer then 82 minutes.",negative
Scenic Route,"I like the fact that the ending left me wondering (but not really wondering too much.) Having lived in the desert, I was originally going to give the film a lower rating than I wound up giving it. Why? Because, we are always taught to never, ever leave your vehicle if you break down while traveling through the desert. And, no water? You can live for a while without food, but you will die very quickly without water. Especially after all of the physical (and mental) trauma those two went through, the lack of water would have made the situation dire. The loss of blood alone would have screwed up rational thinking. So a rescue of any type, with them wandering around, would have been a true miracle. So, when Mitchell's broken phone started ringing, at first I thought, ""Well why the heck didn't they call for help before? Wait, that isn't a satellite phone. Where are the cell towers?"" And, immediately realized that no, maybe they are hallucinating, which is what I expected them to start doing on the second day (if you have ever had to work outside when it is 110 out, you will know what I mean.) Therefore, I think they died. Whatever you want to believe the outcome was, this was a very good movie. I'd like to pose another question: Did Carter actually die the first time, and Mitchell only hallucinated that he wasn't actually dead?",positive
Love Is Strange,"A disappointment. It seemed the movie was made to self-serve the director's own agenda. I'm not saying the questions of gay marriage and its associated life difficulties are not of social importance - in fact, quite the opposite - but presenting it in such a trivial and obvious manner bordering boredom is useless. A storyline of ordinary lives evolving around other ordinary lives all immersed in ordinary circumstances - what new did the movie tell us? Nothing, really. The ""strange"" love story is indeed a very common denominator nowadays. There are gays, there is love, there are difficulties associated with economic, financial and social status - we all know that. Semi-random scenes put together to make a semi-random story lacking fluidity but being generous to slowness is what we actually see. If you want to make a point, make it in a beautiful, artistic way that will leave viewers with internal satisfaction or mental stimulation or visual inspiration. Rather, we see a movie that wants to scream ""Look, life is hard for us gay people, we are misunderstood, we are victims!"" and everything artificially revolves around and is build upon such an attention-seeking statement. The involvement of other characters to justify social diversity and ubiquitousness of personal feelings expressed in different age stages of life cannot hide the foundational personal agenda of victimization. Obviously, old men in love is a powerful and touching subject that attracts empathy, but there is no need to use it as tool in your own belt to overcome your own insecurities and promote clich√© life stories. Because that's how it felt like from the beginning until the end of the movie. Actors did a good job. In fact, this was the only good thing in the movie. Such a waste of their talent. Elongated, mundane scenes tried to provoke some kind of emotions, but were rather completely detached in terms of coherency. I'd ask many of the supporting actors - do you know what the purpose of your character in the movie was?This could have been an orders of magnitude better movie. Basically, if you have heard what Mr Wonderful from Sharks Tank used to say - ""Life is hard, and then you die"" - then you know pretty much everything about this movie. The only remaining question is ""Why?"". Unfortunately, the movie does not attempt to answer it.",negative
Love Is Strange,"LOVE IS STRANGE, a film, unaffectedly directed by Ira Sachs, is so natural and unassuming in its portrayal of relationships that the divide between audience and the characters on the screen disappears; we are directly slipping into their lives with the ease of familiarity. There is a formal beauty to the movie, thanks to the cinematography of Christos Voudouris - the way he captures each space - delineated not only through d√©cor, but through the light which mutates with the atmosphere, very much like a Chardin still-life painting, classic in its grandeur and silence.The plot revolves around two gay men who have lived together for 39 years and finally get married, a decision that will alter their lives in ways that are unexpected and transforming. We first meet Ben, a seventy-one year old artist, (John Lithgow in a breathtaking performance) and his partner George (Alfred Molina in an equally fine portrayal,) a music teacher in a Catholic school - both excitedly, and nervously preparing for the ceremony and the post- wedding party. From the moment we first view Lithgow and Molina singing a duet together - their voices and theatrics in synch and at odds - tender intimacy is apparent. Ira Sachs and co-writer Mauricio Zacharias have created two remarkably gentle and loving individuals, their intimacy and enduring connection, is both understated and powerfully passionate.The consequences of ultimately legitimizing their union bear witness to the harsh realities that accompany that choice. Soon after the nuptials, George gets fired from his job, and the economic demands of existing in NYC, forced to sell the apartment in order to find more affordable housing, interrupts their former cadence of living. Having no alternative, George and Ben, temporarily separate to move in with friends and relatives till they can find a home of their own. Molina and Lithgow stunningly convey the anguish of living apart and the intense longing of being united again. It is as if one person is sliced in half ‚Äì going through the motions, but not fully functioning without the other.LOVE IS STRANGE also references the mysterious corridor of generational diversity - both fractious and enriching. The anxious, rebellious teenager slowly embracing life's uncertainties embodied by Joey, Ben's great-nephew in an excellent performance by Charlie Tahan who is likable, secretive and obnoxious ‚Äì an eternal artifact of an adolescent's growing awareness of life's promises and aching discomforts. And approaching mid-life, are his parents - Kate (Marisa Tomei - a natural wonder) - a writer trying to meet the demands of motherhood and still do her own work and Elliot (Darren E. Burrows) a father too wrapped up in doing business (supporting the family?) to notice the splintering family dynamic. Tomei's facial expressions convey a woman's inner tug-of-war between being a caregiver and accomplishing her own ambitions, shifting from haggardly frustrated to a luminous empathy, particularly for the growing pains of her son on the cusp of adulthood.Director Ira Sachs has given us a tone poem to the beauty, delight and fragility of living in a city - New York - dynamic, diverse and constantly changing, echoing the vicissitudes of life as we stumble through our own personal unfolding. A love story that has depth and endurance - delicate and supple, both romantic and mundane, LOVE IS STRANGE is wrenchingly lovely and generous, but also a reminder that nothing is permanent.",positive
Air,"A bit of a spoiler- SO SPOILER ALERT After watching this movie, I was surprised at the emotional depth it created with only 3 constant actors. The relationship between Bauer and Cartwright had an interesting feel to it, as like all movies in the beginning everything is run of the mill feel good. But as you see court wright start to unravel, it really digs into the human psyche. While I personally would of liked a different beginning, showing some back story to Bauer, and the apocalypse, it still does enough for you to gain a feel for what kind of person Bauer is. I would of also enjoyed a little more with Bauer and Courtwright ""bonding"". As it sort of takes off fast, and leaves you wanting more for a build up. Without summarizing what happens during the movie, I really enjoyed the ending. To me it really did the character justice (trying not to include names to not spoil anything.) Last point, I really wish they showed the character dealing with the consequences of his actions towards the end, the sort of did that with almost like a quick recap. I really wish they would of invested a little more time in showing the emotions left after. Overall, a good movie. It keeps driving a long, while making you think. I'd suggest it as a good ""date night movie."" As long as you can enjoy a good story and dialogue piece, you should like this one.",negative
Air,"I'm not sure what is with other people, but I thought this movie was very good. Maybe they just can't enjoy something that is not a big blockbuster budget mega action movie.I enjoyed the entire movie. I thought the story, acting, set were all good and kept me watching and thinking the entire time. Never once did I think it was boring or wish that it would hurry up already. I thought both main characters were very good and I was never sure who I really wanted to root for.There were only a few places where I thought things wouldn't have gone the way they did them but maybe that is just me.Yes, I would definitely recommend this movie if you like to think and feel rather than just be entertained.",positive
Copenhagen,"The problem with this movie is the main character. He becomes very hard to watch after 20 minutes or so as he apparently has no redeeming qualities. I don't mind an unlikeable character at all, in the hands of a great director and a great actor, but Will just grates on the nerves. For the whole movie.
If the script had gone through two or three more re-writes, they might have had something here. But aside from an interesting performance from Frederikke Dahl Hansen, (a 20 year old actress playing a 14 year old character)....this movie just has nothing to offer. It just kinds of meanders until its very predictable, very unsatisfying conclusion.",negative
Copenhagen,"***warning, possible spoilers*** this movie should be studied in film classes: you watch it, enjoy it, but don't really realize the effectiveness of the writer and director until later. Here is what happens: 1. An analogy best explains this film: we have all probably seen a video of a master with his dog. Sitting in front of the dog is the most delectable treat imaginable to the dog. The dog does nothing even though every fiber of its being wants to gobble up that treat. It is waiting for its masters command. The Masters here are the writer and director, the dog is the male lead. The girl is the treat (and not in a prurient sense). She says she will be 15 (the age of consent) ""in a few days"". He wants to pounce (But not in a sexual sense even though there is obvious physical attraction). 2. The age difference is not for shock value. It is a very effective plot device relating to 1 above. 3. They are alone in a hotel room, both drunk (largely at his insistence). She is the aggressor. The reality is he cannot believe she is only 14 and repeatedly says that throughout the movie. She tries to seduce him, taking off her blouse and kissing him which he appears to accept. 4. The ""masters"" do not outright state that they did not sleep together but instead, more effectively, make that clear by: they both wake up in bed fully clothed (she must have put her top back on) in sharp contrast to his other many dalliances where he graphically wakes up with a naked partner; just prior to this he turns down an offer that most males his age dream about ‚Äì two beautiful drunk girls try to drag him back to their hotel for a threesome. Instead of going with the women, he is much more concerned about having hurt the girl's feelings and rushes out of the bar, leaving the women, to try to call the girl and apologize for acting like a jerk. So, the attraction is not about sex per se. there is much more to his feelings for the girl and he is clearly conflicted. He does not sleep with her.5. There is more to him than meets the eye: he is in Denmark to find his grandfather and understand why he was abandoned by his father. The girl, with a great heart and overlooking the fact that he is superficially an insensitive jerk sees something deeper in him and embraces the cause of him finding his past and takes it upon herself to help him. 6. The girl, is far more substantial and mature than the women he has been sleeping with (who is really older, the girl or his earlier partners?). She too, has a troubled family but is very close to her mother and wants to help him resolve that part of his life. 7. In one effective scene, he simply glances down a street and sees a father briefly interacting with his son (short and effective). 8. The most effective scene in the movie: she takes him to a museum. She brings him to a dark corner where there is a bust. She tells him she has never brought anyone there before. She stands next to the bust. It is an exact image of the girl. She tells him she is really hundreds of years old and he says the bust is 1500 years old. This scene is a metaphor for what the movie accomplishes. After 1500 years, here she (who posed for the bust) is here again, resurrected, with the human traits that allowed us to survive over those 1500 years: the yearning for family, love, and a striving for happiness even in an imperfect world. In other hands this might seem corny, here it is movie-making genius.",positive
God's Pocket,"It's 1978, and in a little working-class neighborhood on the south side of Philadelphia, Mickey Scarpato (Philip Seymour Hoffman) scrapes together a living as a small-time criminal alongside his best pal, Bird (John Turturro). Mickey's always been something of an outcast in God's Pocket - unlike most of its residents, he wasn't born and raised here - but his devotion to wife Jeanie (Christina Hendricks) and his ties to organized crime have at least garnered him a bit of respect.When Jeanie's son Leon (Caleb Landry Jones) turns up dead on a construction site, the police tell her it was an accident, but she doesn't buy it. Eager to please, Mickey agrees to make inquiries into the circumstances of the boy's demise, and also arrange for the funeral services - sadly, he's woefully incapable of performing either of these duties without leading to some sort of calamity. Meanwhile, a well-known newspaper columnist (Richard Jenkins) is also investigating the death, but his first meeting with Jeanie leaves him far more concerned with getting under her skirt, rather than to the bottom of the mystery.First-time director John Slattery (Mad Men) coaxes brilliant performances from the immensely talented cast he's assembled, with Hoffman's portrayal of a man broken and beaten down by life serving as a haunting reminder of the tragedy that would occur shortly after the film's Sundance debut. Hendricks is the lone weak point in an otherwise flawless cast, with her character's motivations for succumbing to the advances of an aging, alcoholic newspaperman straining the limits of credibility. Much like the neighborhood where the film takes place, God's Pocket is populated with an assortment of interesting, colorful characters that we're anxious to learn more about. It's a shame, then, that none of these characters are ever fully developed. Slattery's debut plays more like a collection of scenes rather than a completed work, leaving the audience to only ponder what lies beneath the surface.",negative
God's Pocket,"Actor turned director John Slattery brings his trademark black humor and cynicism from his MAD MEN role (and effective helming of occasional episodes) to the big screen with the successfully offbeat GOD'S POCKET, a faithful adaptation of Pete Dexter's 1983 novel about the Lower Depths of a Philly neighborhood. Clearly not for all tastes, the film appealed to my love of against the grain, anti-trendy cinema (more about that later).The late Philip Seymour Hoffman clearly admired this material too, taking on a producer credit, as did the film's cinematographer. His role is reminiscent of his work in Sidney Lumet's final movie BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD, portraying a ne'er-do-well criminal trying to survive in a hostile environment. It's not a showy role, and Hoffman consistently underplays while Slattery gives many supporting players the flashy, show-stopping scenes.Slattery shows great confidence in never explicitly referring to the film's time frame ('80s) -there are no superimposed Time Cards, no narration, just the period clothing, cars and old rotary telephones to indicate we're watching a period piece. Hoffman is cast as an outsider in the Philadelphia slum cynically known as God's Pocket, married to the glamorous Christina Hendricks (a Slattery good luck charm from his lengthy stint opposite her on MAD MEN), living with her nutty and self- destructive son (flamboyant and talented young actor Caleb Landry Jones).Hoffman's partner in crime is skillfully etched by John Turturro, who like Hoffman is a gambling addict. They are more in danger from The Mob than the police due to their inevitable debts arising from playing the ponies, and Turturro's pipe dreams of owning a race horse some day.The ensuing comedy of errors gives Slattery the opportunity to distract and surprise the viewer with unexpected turns of events and shocks which I won't spoil here. Character actress Joyce Van Patten, whom I have admired since first being impressed by her '60s TV appearances and choice role over 40 years back in the forgotten 20th Century Fox youth picture MAKING IT, highlights the movie's most memorable scene as Turturro's sister running a flower shop and dealing with a couple of armed and dangerous Mob goons.Themes of the story, personal to author Dexter and drawn from his stint as a reporter in Philly, are brought out by the nearly washed-up columnist effortlessly played by Richard Jenkins. His adulterous romance with Hendricks' character is unbelievable, but Hendricks (still awaiting the breakthrough movie role she deserves a la Sophia Loren's career-making opportunity in TWO WOMEN) does lend her ambiguity and nuance known to her legion of fans from MAD MEN's Joan to almost make it work.Dealing with the venal undertaker Eddie Marsan (a standout here on loan from Mike Leigh's stock company), Hoffman descends into strange and uncomfortable black comedy dealing with the ""body removal"" antics involving his stepson, treated by Slattery using a flashback structure that may or may not have been the best choice for storytelling. Various violent outbursts lead to a coda which almost parodies happy endings.Besides the Hitchcockian morbid black humor involving the stepson's corpse, the climactic moment of mob violence (not Mob but lowercase mob) in which the insular denizens of God's Pocket unite against outsiders recalls the Master of Suspense's power to deliver the coup de grace, notably in LIFEBOAT. Critics generally dismissing GOD'S POCKET are clearly entitled to their opinions, but miss the point. Like the great B movies of the '40s and '50s (including films noirs), many of which have lived on to entertain future generations of movie buffs who have little time or patience for the big-budget blockbusters (and Oscar-bait) of that era, Slattery has crafted a character-driven, idiosyncratic entertainment that is out of step with current trends.It is easy to criticize and lampoon the mainstream sellouts of the Michael Bay persuasion, but as a long-time film fanatic and former professional critic I am more militantly opposed to the recent wave of all-flash/no-substance ""visionaries"" (I truly hate that trailer clich√©) dominant today. Bloated junk like THE WOLF OF WALL STREET = big box office and mindless raves/Oscar noms, but is embarrassing and nearly unwatchable. How can a film historian like Scorsese ignore the famous warnings of Frank Capra's autobiography (where he explained why he retired from directing after suffering at the hands of overly powerful actors in charge like Glenn Ford and Frank Sinatra) and end up grinding out padded and tiresome Leonardo DiCaprio vehicles? Could it be the almighty dollar, or does the maestro merely fancy himself as an American Visconti?At any rate, I hope Slattery does not go this route (Scorsese's decline from gritty, effective early films to elephantine latter-day projects repeats the great Otto Preminger's similar career missteps), and instead maintains his personal approach. The man's talented and perfectly capable of making an Eastwood-esque transition from actor to successful director.",positive
V/H/S Viral,"This movie is borderline unwatchable. I tried watching this in two sittings and by the third I fell asleep. It's so bad, it's like they hunted down the worst horror writers and directors in hopes to sabotage a continuing V/H/S franchise and they succeeded. The camera-work is horrendous. It makes the final fight in Alex Cross look like The Raid 2. Awkward edits, annoying static every five seconds, terribly uninteresting plots and terribly written too. It's a shame because there was much potential from the first two V/H/S movies that this could become a good horror anthology franchise because it's such a great premise and found-footage is best in small 20-30 minutes doses but this movie tried to make an actual story with a couple random segments that make no sense. Gun to my head, if I had to pick the best segment it would have to be the one with the alien penises. That sentence alone should tell you enough about this movie. It was such a dumb segment and it made no sense but actually attempted suspense and some form of story. The main story is dogsh*t. I hate this movie a lot. I remember thinking after V/H/S/2 ""man, what a great idea for a horror franchise. I hope they continue these"" and then Viral had to come along and take a heaping dump on film and sell it as a V/H/S movie. If you liked the first two V/H/S movies, don't watch this. Don't ever watch this movie unless you want to feel depressed and p*ssed off in which case by all means V/H/S: Viral is the only thing you should watch. This movie sucks balls. It should have never been made and whoever greenlit this atrocious script should be fired if they haven't been already. I wish I could unwatch this movie. Spare yourselves.",negative
V/H/S Viral,"I watched this movie at the Lisbon Horror Movie Festival (MotelX); when I did, I hadn't watched any of the previous ones (now I have), so I did't really know what I was going to see, and I quite enjoyed the experience.As its predecessors, V/H/S Viral is formed by three found-footage stories, tied together by yet a fourth frame story, also filmed in a found-footage fashion. (Apparently there was supposed to be one more segment, directed by Todd Lincoln, but it was never filmed or it didn't make the final cut).The frame story, ""Vicious Circles"" by Marcel Sarmiento, is quite unsettling. It starts with a police car chase of an ice-cream van, and a young couple much in love who is split by the intrusion of pure horror in the form of viral videos that appear in their mobile phones. This story is split in four small segments, some very brief, others much longer, until the final scene which closes the circle, so to speak. It was in general quite enjoyable, with some concessions to gore, a few clich√©s flowing around and some very enjoyable scenes. The use of music in the very last segment (Beethoven's 9th symphony) was very clever, in my opinion. My score for this story, 7,5/10.The second story (first of the viral videos), filmed by Gregg Bishop, is more a mockumentary than a found-footage, although it obviously includes many ""interviews"" and closed-circuit camera footage. It tells the story of ""Dante the Great"", who always dreamed of being a magician and got to do so when he discovered a mysterious cape: a cape that was so powerful that apparently it frightened Houdini himself. This story is the least gore of all the pack, and it is in a way quite predictable, but it is well executed. The main sin for me is that at one point the movie abandons the ""found-footage"" form and includes some scenes with a more traditional filming; and that is hard to accept in a movie that is precisely about videotapes being found. Score: 6/10.""Parallel Monsters"", by Nacho Vigalondo, is probably the best of them all. It is filmed in Spanish and has a slightly different look, more professional, more acted, less realistic in a way. It tells the story of a scientist who opens a gate to another parallel universe, only to find that in that universe there is another version of himself, who has built exactly the same machine. When they decide to exchange universes for 15 minutes, he will discover that there are in fact a few, ahem, minor differences between their universes. This segment is quite original, very funny, very cruel; it explores its premise with intelligence and leaves quite a few things unexplained (which is not a bad thing at all). The only thing that disappointed me a bit was that the development of the story turns to more conventional horror clich√©s. In any case, I am giving it a 9/10.""Bonestorm"", by Justin Benson & Aaron Moorhead, follows a group of teenage American skaters who decide to go to Tijuana to explore an abandoned skating park and film some videos. When they get there, they get haunted by a death-worshiping cult (or something similar) who used that skate park as their ceremonial ground. The premise is extremely simple, and apart from a few scares and gore scenes you won't get much out of it. The best part is the humor in the creation of the characters. Score: 7/10.All in all, I enjoyed the experience. The segments are obviously uneven, but I guess that's inevitable in a collective movie. Nacho Vigalondo's segment is one level above the rest, followed by the frame story by Marcel Sarmiento. After watching the three films of the trilogy, I think it was a good idea to abandon the ""damned videotape"" idea and update it in a form of viral videos, which allows for a different kind of frame story.Oh, and I think the movie is trying to tell us something about our urge to be famous at any cost and by any means, but quite sincerely, I don't think anyone who sees this movie will really care about that.Overall score: 7/10",positive
Better Living Through Chemistry,"In a small idyllic town, the village pharmacist knows everyone's secrets. Doug Varney (Sam Rockwell) has a fitness compulsive wife (Michelle Monaghan) an unruly child (Harrison Holzer) and an irritating narrator (Jane Fonda). Stuck in a rut he meets rich wife Elizabeth (Olivia Wilde) who breaks Doug out and instills confidence in him through an affair and pills.The film reminded me of a generic Magnolia indie. Let's throw together some quirky characters, get a couple of names, create an unlikely scenario, toss in a few cliches, an appropriate sound track and stir. There was nothing overly entertaining in the film, yet at the same time I wasn't bored waiting for something to happen. For those who can't get enough of the clever and quirky indies, you might get a quick fix from this film.Parental Guide: F-bomb. Sex.",negative
Better Living Through Chemistry,"This film tells the story of a suburban pharmacist undergoing a midlife crisis. His life spirals out of control when he meets a beautiful female customer.""Better Living Through Chemistry"" spends an adequate amount of time building up a picture of Douglas' the unpleasant life. He is constantly undermined by his loved ones, and it does not feel great to be him. I feel for him, and I think Sam Rockwell does well in making me care for his character. Douglas' life changes quickly after Elizabeth arrives, some for the better and some for the worse. There is much food for thought, especially whether life is better through chemistry. The build up of the policeman plus DEA agent encounter is well done as well! It really got the character and me as well. I enjoy watching ""Better Living Through Chemistry"" a lot, as it gives people bits to chew on, reflecting on their own lives.",positive
XX,"Proposing a collection of original shorts in a horror landscape over-saturated with remakes and old recipes is a daring proposition, with or without gender twist. XX delivers four 20 minutes works with an episodic animated sequence as interlude. While the animated part is simply masterful, the quality of the shorts varies. 1st Short: The Box. This short seems to draw an illustration of how a dysfunctional family would end up if closeted drama and shouting exchanges were replaced by a supernatural element. Rather ambient, it lets you wonder what to expect. Unfortunately, the conclusion misses the target and leaves you wanting something more elaborate. 2nd Short: The Birthday party. Expedited premise and hardly believable character behavior make this short rather weak. It seems to be intended as a joke and it sort of, kind of work if you're a good audience. Good material for fan theory, but nothing memorable. 3rd Short: Don't fall. Typical monster story, with all the clich√©s of the genre packed into way too little time to deliver any kind of tension. A success if you want to watch absolutely every (bad) monster film in 20 minutes, a failure if you're looking for anything else. 4rh Short: Her only living son. The best of the lot, with a tense ambiance from early on, and the only one with enough background to establish a more solid story line. The female lead knows how to act, and the dramatic arc is built better than in the 3 other shorts. Nonetheless, some of the narrative is expedited and make the story fall a bit flat. Ultimately, the bundle gives the impression that none of the stories were meant for the short format to begin with, and try to follow the same formula as full feature films while condensing it in 20 minutes. As a result most of the shorts rest on interesting ideas but none seems to know whether to be a trailer or a feature film, to the detriment of tension and narrative. It remains that there are far worse movies around. ""The box"" and ""Her only living son"" have a compelling second level of reading and can push your empathy buttons just right, and ""The Birthday Party"" might make you smile (""Don't Fall"", though is a total miss). Funnily enough the 20 minutes format, as ambiguous as it is, also makes sure that no story overstays its welcome. I'll give it a 5 for effort and for the animation. Watch it if you want something a bit different, and for some good starting ideas if you're a fiction writer. Give it a rain check if you're looking for a mind-blowing work. The good: Interesting ideas + Good metaphors + Refreshing formula + Masterful animated intermezzos The meh: - Average acting - Narrative doesn't fit the format well - Soundtrack could be more subtleThe bad: - The whole 3rd short (Don't fall). - The mood lapse between the 1rst and 2nd short.",negative

Assault on Wall Street,Uwe Boll is known as one of the worst directors ever known to be in the film industry for making movies for big budgets and making absolutely nothing back from them.hes hated by all the directors in Hollywood and is mocked by people all over the world.his last few movies have been universally panned by critics all of them adapted from popular video games.after owners of well known game metal gear solid refused to sell the rights to Uwe Boll because his history as a director.i think he finally woke up and smelled the smoke because his latest film Assault on wall street is actually good.The film stars Dominic Purcell and Erin Karpluk .the film starts as Jim a security guard for an armored truck who is struggling to pay for his ill wife who is recovering from cancer and Jim must find ways to pay for his wife's treatment after his disastrous investment his stockbroker advised him to make.he soon looses everything he has and decides to take extreme measures to get revenge on the rich and greedy people who got him into the situation hes in.although the film starts off slow it somehow manages to keep you interested and you sympathize with Jim and actually start to root for him even though you know what hes doing is wrong.it picks up near the end and to be honest it impressed me even though Uwe Boll has gone really dark for this one.with a A+ performance by Dominic Purcell and Erin Karplukthis is a film Uwe Boll can actually be proud of and not have to worry about being universally panned.many people will watch this movie and give it a bad review just because of Uwe Boll past and because they quite frankly don't like him or his methods but thats not what film is about.the film is a huge improvement over his previous films and all i can say is Uwe Boll keep it up stay away from the video game adapt ions and concentrate on your own work.now I'm not saying this film is amazing but it is a damn good film.6.5/10,negative

Uwe Boll has created an underground masterpiece which will probably only achieve its place in film history after the fall of the Capitalist society he so strongly lambastes in this extraordinary film. I laughed, I cried, and in the end I cheered for the downtrodden protagonist as he led his Assault on every person who profited from his financial demise and devastating personal losses.

Prince Avalanche,I watched this because it was billed as a comedy by IMDb. Recently I have noticed a trend for movies to be about absolutely nothing. Greenberg with Ben Stiller was one such disappointment. It was a mind numbing character study and it reminded me of Prince Avalanche inasmuch as I sat through the whole film waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did. At some point it just ended and I felt like an idiot for sitting through it.I'm a simple guy who likes his entertainment straightforward. I want to be taken away from reality for 90 minutes as I have enough of it already in my real life. Movies which just give us more of reality need to be clearly marked as such. Rant over.,negative
Prince Avalanche,"""Prince Avalanche"" is a great cinema experience for just about everyone. It begins as the ultimate road movie (literally, a pair of mismatched Texans spend their summer painting roads) but quickly takes a detour into a world of visual poetry, provocative characterizations and deep introspection. And all the while it manages to maintain a sense of brainless comedy that the storyline & DVD cover might lead us to expect.In spite of its grand visual setting in the majesty & desolation of fire-ravaged Texas, this is a very minimalistic production with just 2 main characters, 2 supporting characters and 10 or 20 miles of desolate Texas roads in the aftermath of the 1987 wildfires (it was actually filmed at the site of the 2012 Batstrop County fire). Being set in the 80s adds to the comedy & charm of this quirky flick. Be prepared to see Paul Rudd sporting a very ""Magmum P.I."" moustache and white tube socks with those 3 funky colored stripes at the top.There aren't a lot of big gags but instead the humor comes from the low-key bizarre dialogues between our 2 leads, ""Alvin"" (Paul Rudd) who is the self appointed leader because he's the self-proclaimed smarter of the two, and ""Lance"" (Emile Hirsch) who isn't the brightest doorknob. The laughs hinge on the weirdness of their discussions much like the hilariously strange banter between John Travolta & Samuel L. Jackson in ""Pulp Fiction"".In all, ""Prince Avalanche"" is an excellent show of what the French philosophers might call ""La Comedy Humaine"" with its poignant look at human nature. And at the same time the movie isn't so heady that it's above an occasional brainless laugh, like having the two fight & chase each other through the forest with axes.I wanted to mention 2 trivial tidbits in case you're interested in stuff like this: (1) The filmmakers note that no animals were harmed, so the occasional scenes of roadkill, fishing and what looked like a small skinned monkey for dinner were apparently props (this is good to know as a lot of indie films slip under the AHA radar and use real animals to save money on special effects), and (2) the excellent performance by supporting actress Joyce Payne (the woman in the ruins) was actually an unscripted addition to the film when they met Joyce, an actual ex-resident, while filming. As you will see, her character becomes pivotal to the story & meaning of the film, reminding us that great moments in cinema do often happen by accident.""Prince Avalanche"" is rated R which surprised me since there is no nudity, not much profanity and no violence. There are 1 or 2 dialogues about sexual situations which might get a bit racy for the kiddies, but other than that, this is a tame film. I highly recommend it to fans of Jim Jarmusch (""Down By Law"", ""Coffee & Cigarettes"") and Wim Wenders (""Million Dollar Hotel"", ""Lisbon Story"", ""Alice in the Cities"").",positive
Good People,"I like James Franco a lot, however I have comes to terms with the fact that just because he is in a movie does not mean it is going to be a good movie. Fortunately with ""Good People"" that is not the case.Right from the get go the movie had my attention, it starts off very well and sets the mood for the rest of the movie. From there it gets a little slow but remains interesting. Then once things pick up again it is pretty entertaining.I find it hard to rate this movie too high since the story is generic and it doesn't really do any original or new. However it is still a very watchable and entertaining thriller.6.5/10",negative
Good People,"Hard to ignore some gaping mistakes in the plot:1. The lead character finds the money, but not the briefcase full of ""liquid O"" that is right behind it. He finds a box full of cash, but does not look in the ceiling again to see if there is more, or anything else up there?2. The thugs find the drugs in the apartment after the police have searched the apartment. The police, suspecting that there is a drug tie-in, never think to look in the drop-down ceiling?3. The couple is about to be evicted, and about to lose ""the house."" This means the house they are renting? Why not move into the house that he is fixing up and has inherited? It had a roof and walls, and he knows carpentry. No rent to pay if they move into the house, yes? 4. No one seems concerned that a police officer, or someone dressed as a police officer, shot a detective and continued shooting in a public park. Never mentioned on the news they listen to? Never brought up in any of the conversations among the characters?5. When nailing the thug to the floor, the lead male is somehow able to know exactly where both of his feet were positioned, although the floor is solid where he is standing, with none of the cracks that can be seen in other parts of the floor. 6. The same thug, hiding from people with guns, lights a cigarette, which might not seem wise, since smoke could be seen coming from the room where he is hiding, or smelled. But no one does see or smell it, including Khan, who walks right up to, and almost past, the room before being shot at.7. No one tries to put out the fire, which is confined to a small section of the house once the shooting has ended. And of course, the clich√©s were terrifying--the couple trying to have a child and learning at the end that they were going to have a child. The detective who has lost a child to drugs, and is now seeking to destroy the drug trade? Somehow, the obvious clich√© was missed--this couple needed a dog. A dog, wounded in the battle with the drug dealers, but recovered by the end and leaping into their laps after the news that a child is on the way.

Willow Creek,"I'll be honest. This film definitely went for full Blair Witch and just barely did not make it. On the upside though, it did get very close. Willow Creek is one of those movies that although it doesn't quite scare you, it leaves you unnerved. The film is very amateur but this serves to benefit the film. The buildup is fantastic but in my opinion, the payoff was a tad lackluster, but perhaps that is just because i wanted to know more. Willow Creek is by no means a masterpiece of horror but it is a very effective shaky cam film with good suspense and eerie atmosphere. Warning though, some parts of this film do drag on... a lot. The beginning of the film lasts forever, and one scene in particular drums up the suspense well but ultimately runs too long in the middle of this very short movie. If you read about this film and immediately though you might be interested, watch it. I did not go in expecting too much, but I was pleased with what I saw.",negative
Willow Creek,"This really worked for me. I know the usual contingent is out with cries of, ""Boring!"" and ""Worst movie I ever saw!""... but... whatever. They show up for everything short of Chainsaw Gynecologist IV. First off... if you don't like found footage movies, you won't like this. If you didn't like The Blair Witch Project or June 9, you won't like this. If you can't stand low budget movies that don't have loads of special FX and jump cuts... you definitely need to look elsewhere.Willow Creek is a slow convincing build-up to a chaotic slap of weirdness. Everything leading up to that ending is atmosphere and getting to know the characters and ramping up the dread of what might happen to folks who wander out into the woods looking for monsters. There's a LONG scene in a tent with the characters becoming increasingly terrified... can you watch long scenes where not much happens? Do you have that sort of patience? If so you might like this movie as much as I did. Also, I'd say the real horror of the film doesn't sink in until after a few moments are taken to mull over the implications of what we see in those final moments. How they were foreshadowed early on. It's a creepy movie and I'm glad I watched it.",positive
Earth to Echo,"This movie was cheaply made, along the lines of Paranormal Activity, web cam horror flicks, etc. As has been stated by several other reviewers, it is a cheap knock-off of E.T.

The part when Munch chases after the truck the girls were joking about when they were calling out for him like ""Munch Munch Munch!"" As in the sound effects of eating.

"Hello, My Name Is Doris","Sally Field gets the role of a lifetime as a hoarder working in a trendy office who has the hots for a younger employee. One of the best things about ""Hello, My Name Is Doris"" is that it shows how Doris is sort of an oddball and can irritate those around her, but is nonetheless a good person. She was the only sibling who took care of their mom. Basically, Doris wants to stick to her house and possessions, and their representation of the old days amid a world that advances too quickly for her, and her attraction to this younger man is the only possible sexual satisfaction for her. Most of all, it's refreshing to see a movie that focuses on older women (aside from Doris, there's her friend Roz, played by Tyne Daly). One of the most impressive scenes is when Doris gets photographed (and believe me, Sally Field looks sexy in some of those outfits that she wears).The long and short of it is that ""Hello, My Name Is Doris"" is a really good movie. Sally Field has gotten some of the best roles of her career later in life, and I hope that she continues to do so. She, Tyne Daly, and the rest of the cast put in fine performances.

The Other Side of Hope,"The Other Side of Hope tells the story of a Syrian refugee and the challenges he meets in Finland. The film features his typical cinematographic style but the picture itself is disappointing.It is clear that Kaurism√§ki is much more at ease describing Finnish people. His Finnish characters are very funny and colorful, however when it comes to the refugee characters, he becomes shy and unimaginative.The main character Khaled is probably a very good person but he is a very boring character. More than that he does not look like a refugee; he looks neither tired, hungry or frustrated. He reminds one of a successful salesman or a post-doctorate student.His story is not compelling and his acting is not convincing. Kaurism√§ki received a specific commission and when making this politically correct movie he was afraid of making fun of foreigners or their religion. He even made the character an atheist which is highly unlikely for people from this country.Occasionally the film was funny, but only in the segments featuring Finns, The plot is not very interesting and does not have any twists or surprises. When undertaking this theme, Kaurism√§ki has shown that he does not know the topic or want to know it.

The Vault,"The criminal gang featured in the movie was a motley crew that initially seemed competent, then they sort of disintegrated but not as the horror script would suggest as they began to disappear. Instead most of them succumbed to a poor script. Using the typical eerie music along with some strains of Alien (1979) chords the movie proceeds to include the intermittent lights blinking in and out. There's no clear explanation behind the robbery. In several instances, some of the criminals are so nasty that it encouraged that they meet a miserable demise. And why spend manpower on one person unnecessarily guarding bank hostages instead of just locking them in some unescapable room or why let another person kill themselves when there was plenty of time to prevent it? And who threatens a hostage in order to get answers without using a weapon in order to encourage a more truthful response under the circumstances, except when it comes to female bank tellers? The movie also includes a somewhat sympathetic criminal character being tormented towards innocence by a female bank teller for supposedly an additional layered subplot but that is more of a distraction. Then there's even a bullet through a window scene that doesn't make real sense as a script-driven dramatic device even with a surprisingly decent attempt to explain it away. Even the reported past bank robbery attempt story doesn't hold up in regards to law enforcement protocol and seems much more scripted just for supposedly the horror affect but it's pretty absurd. Instead of a truly professional group of bank robbers against a haunting unknown, the heightened dynamics is lost in contrast to The Devil's Tomb (2009) or even the more straight forward but much more compelling The Numbers Station (2013). With this particular criminal gang, its little wonder that they disappeared so fast, unfortunately for the audience not fast enough. The short, The Vault seems to follow most of the typical horror movie attempts at scare scenarios which by now have become either familiar or the audience just inured to it. There's very little in the way scary scenes or originality. There's one promising scene later in the movie involving a girl, but it's not really followed up with and used only for an attempted scare that becomes only another typical fright shot. Suddenly with only about twenty minutes to go there's a big turn around but again unfortunately, the absence of a good backstory takes a lot out of the emotional appeal of the climatic ending. There's even a Sixth Sense (1999) flavor in this movie that could have had potential towards making this a decent movie. But it's all too little too late and unconvincing as well as the final typical, boring, over-used, clique shot that definitely didn't redeem the movie.",negative
The Vault,"This film tells the story of a group of five bank robbers who aim to rob half a million dollars from the bank. The think they hit the jackpot when the assistant manager of the bank offers help to get them six million dollars from the mysterious underground vault.""The Vault"" is a very low budget film, and it really shows. That in itself is not a problem, if it had a good story and tight editing. Unfortunately, there is not much to fill the screen time, and the pacing is just really slow. It takes the robbers thirty minutes to get to the vault, and then another thirty minutes for things to get going. There are many implausible or illogical things happening in the film too. I find it implausible that there is only one man trying to open the vault, while the two women watch on CCTV. Could they not have helped with opening the vault? It is a low budget B film through and through. There will be fans who like this film, but it is not for me.",positive
Welcome to Me,"The director & writer should be ashamed of this film. All it does is spread MORE misinformation, misrepresent a horribly excruciating problem, and on top of that, exploits those with it.This is not even close to an accurate depiction of BPD, and this film will only do one thing- further stigmatize this horrible affliction, making people even more hateful & cruel, which is already a bad enough problem right now.Their complete misunderstanding of the disorder is nauseating. Don't see this movie. Don't see any movie about a character with BPD, because it has always been done ridiculously poorly & has stigmatized those with it further. To a huge degree.If you want to actually learn a bit about it, go to Wikipedia, and you will find a very accurate detailing of the disorder, without bias, prejudice or ignorance.",negative
Welcome to Me,"I cried the whole movie. Happy happy enlightening tears. I felt like I was watching my sister on screen. It felt like one big old metaphor being in the audience, as I feel kind of like an audience member of my own family.My sister who has BDP is the strongest person I know. This disorder is a rough one and those who have it are true warriors, however as a result of my sister's disorder, I have been neglected by my family my whole life. It took me a really long time to fully realize this, but now that I do I am finally starting to find self worth. This movie not only captures what it's like to have BDP, but whats it's like to close to someone with BDP. Seeing Alice's relationship with Gina hit me really hard. Gina is so strong and I hope I can be like her once I find more confidence in myself. Seeing her stand up for herself is something I hope I can one day do. The fact that someone out there decided to add some humor to such a hidden, stigmatized, mental illness, really truly brings light to the my broken heart. I am so so so so so so thankful for this movie. Bravo.",positive
Incarnate,"I was fuming by the time I left the theatre.I cannot begin to tell you how much I absolutely loathe that a premise that has so much potential gets butchered the way this one did.We finally get a main character who could be so unique ‚Äì not only is he a scientist, which finally takes away the only approach made on these movies which is the religious one ‚Äì but he can also get in people's minds. And what do we get instead? The epitome of all clich√©s. And there are so many of them, don't even get me started. There is the scruffy grief-stricken widower with nothing to lose, a religious crisis and a long time vendetta, there are his couple of sidekicks with the fancy aura reading machines (except here they are ion charges or something), and the secretive mentor and the deadly serum that the mc says he is never going to use but you so know he is gonna ‚Äì and the rest is just filler for something that could be truly creepy.Incarnation grabbed my attention from the get go, particularly with that initial dance club scene, which featured the most perfect song for the moment and gave me an almost Matrix vibe. We quickly know what is going on, what our main guy is capable of doing and how he is doing it ‚Äì all through the natural sequence of the story, not because the information is dumped on the viewer. And that approach pretty much stops there.From that point on it all went downhill. There are so many plot holes (Why call it Maggie?? Even the demons called it Maggie! It's the name of an innocent woman, for crying out loud. Why does Ember need to almost die if he says he found out about his ability while he was sleeping? Why not just give him a powerful sedative? Why did the entity target Ember so particularly? I mean, if it wanted to keep possessing people it should have left him minding his own business, not helping anyone cause he was just trying to lead a normal life, right? Why was the boy not tied up if it was so dangerous for him to touch anyone? Come to think of it, why did it just stand there? Why did people touch Ember on the street seconds after yelling for people not to touch him? There is so much more but I forgot it in the meantime), the dialogues are cringe-worthy, whatever information needs to be delivered is dumped without much context, the kid's mother has no heart and doesn't really seem concerned for her son's well-being, she is actually doing Ember a favour of allowing him to help the boy and the way things developed is just why I tend to stay away from movie theatres for months in a row. Worst of all, something that could be incredibly original turned out to be a total rip off of a movie I watched many moons ago, right down to the way it ended. Except the other one took place in some woods, I think.*sigh*There were definitely interesting touches here and there like the detail of the watches stopping, the fact that Ember is in a wheelchair provided some exciting scenes, and even the ending, despite being a total rip-off, had a bittersweet tinge to it considering what Felix had told Ember. However, overall I cannot say Incarnate is worth watching.",negative
Incarnate,"I seem to be forced to write a review every now and then to counter the teens and 20 somethings that think they need to review every freaking thing in front of their heads. As an adult I can say comparatively speaking in regards to Exorcism, Possession, Evil doings and all things of the nether world this flick is worth the ticket. Aaron plays his role out fantastically (enough that I teared up at times) and until the end of the movie you will see the moments that hearken back to the decades previous releases but this one certainly offers a unique twist on the understanding of good vs. evil.I found myself nodding early on as a former Catholic and someone who just read way too much to keep believing in Santa Clause or religious super heroes I will say that I have plenty of room in my mind for universe yet untold that retains the secrets of untold, infinite galaxies (Hubble has scratched the surface and soon a new version of Hubble will be hurtling around the Earth).The cast is just fine and spot on with the sincerity in which they convey their emotional portrayals. I know full well there have been other releases over the last 7 years that fulfill most of the requirements of this genre but Incarnate has heart and an emotional connection I thought was somewhat left out or diminished in the other movies of this similar nature.As we hear Aaron's arch nemesis character say in the movie ""There are some things far worse than death""",positive
Ninja: Shadow of a Tear,".......To the late eighties and early nineties when direct to video action movies were big Business, and made household names of Van Damme, Seagal, Blanks, Rothrock and many more.Casey Bowmans life is shattered by a savage act of violence, when his wife is murdered. Vowing revenge, he tracks the killer to Rangoon with the help of a wise sensei. His only clues: a series of victims whose necks bear the distinctive mark of strangulation by barbed wire. Casey must sharpen his battle skills to the next level, as he must finally become an invisible warrior worthy of the name Ninja. But just when his prey is cornered, an unexpected twist shows Casey that his battle is only beginning: he truly can trust no one.....The first movie in my opinion was a load of old rubbish, the action was mundane, and it looked very bad. This is something else though, and Adkins has really stepped up a few gears since that movie. Assassination games, USol day of reckoning, Expendables 2 have really shown his skill, and this movie escalates that to another level.The movie is just Death Wish meets Commando by way of First Blood part 2, and the action is relentless from beginning to end.If you loved renting out American Kickboxer, or any film that ended with Kickboxer, claws, or Ninja in the title, then this will be for you.This could be the turning point for direct to DVD action movies.",negative
Ninja: Shadow of a Tear,"Saw this early at the Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas and it is quite possibly the greatest DTV action movie ever made.Though many would not be proud of it, but I am a DTV (direct to video) expert. I subject myself to watching pretty much every DTV action movie ever made. Though most of them are just absolutely awful, it is all worth it when a Unisol Regen or Blood and Bone comes along and blows you away.The main problems with dtv movies are: 1. Zero budget 2. Shaky cam/quick edits 3. Actors not willing to put in the work for the fight scenes to look realistic 4. Stupid plots with dumb romancesThough Ninja Shadow of a Tear is on a small budget, all of the aforementioned problems are fixed. The movie is completely without shaky cam and quick editing. The plot is very basic and there is no fat to try and make it anything other than what it is....an incredible action movie. And finally, the incredible Scott Adkins and the amazing stunt team put in some amazing fights.One scene in particular is Scott Adkins versus 6 guys in a dojo and the entire fight is filmed in one take with zero editing...like the Alphonso Cauron of DTV shots. It was absolutely amazing.Just an amazing fight movie that takes the best fight scenes ever and mixes it with Rambo, old Cannon movies from the 80's, and Enter the Dragon and other Asian flicks from the 70's. Just a perfect movie that looks like a big budget Hollywood flick. Not a single dollar was wasted and no goofy cgi or wires were used. I can't recommend this movie enough. The action is incredible and everything came together to make one of the best fight films of all- time. Hollywood, please wake up and give Adkins/Florentine a budget and I think you would be amazing at what they can do.If you are looking to check out other great DTV movies and save yourself the trouble of all the nonsense and garbage I have seen, check out the following. But most importantly, check out Ninja Shadow of a Tear when it is released. It is a definitely blu-ray buy for me.1. Universal Solider Regeneration 2. Ninja Shadow of a Tear 3. Blood and Bone 4. Undisputed 3 5. Wake of Death (pretty much all of the Van Dammes are watchable) 6. Undisputed 2 7. Universal Soldier Day of Reckoning (just watch the last 45 minutes)",positive
Wyrmwood: Road of the Dead,"WYRMWOOD is a high energy zombie flick from Australia that combines the road movie genre with a classic zombie apocalypse outbreak type horror yarn. It has a little of the verve of VERSUS but in the end I found it quite predictable and a little overwhelming.What's clear from the outset is that this is one step up from being an amateur film. The look of the zombies is cheap, especially with those Halloween party contact lenses, although there's copious gore to help make up for this. The acting is of a generally poor quality, but the film goes for a semi-serious approach so that doesn't matter too much.What WYRMWOOD does offer is action in spades. There's barely any plot, just a handful of characters battling both zombies and some sinister scientists bent on human experimentation. None of it made much sense to me, but the director works hard to infuse his film with vibrancy and momentum, and he does succeed in part.",negative
Wyrmwood: Road of the Dead,"Okay, maybe not THE BEST 90 minutes of my life, but it's definitely up there! I'm quite critical of movies and this movie didn't disappoint. This movie starts at 100 miles an hour right out of the gate. It's nail biting, exhilarating with enough humor to get your belly moving! You can tell they didn't have a big budget, but the camera work and pace of the film definitely makes up for it. Hats off to the Roach-Tuner brothers in their first feature film. Looking forward to part 2...?",positive
Contracted,"As a big horror fan, particularly the body horror subgenre, I was excited to see this movie at Chicago International Film Festival. Unfortunately, it's so utterly, astonishingly preposterous that enjoyment was impossible. ""The Toxic Avenger"" is more plausible and well-reasoned than this.The main character almost immediately suffers a horrible symptom that would have any sensible woman dialing 911, but she opts to work a shift at a restaurant instead. I'll grant the filmmakers that maybe her disease is dialing up her stupidity, but 30 minutes in, her outward appearance is horrifying - the makeup effects are the sole redeeming element - and none of the other characters seem to notice, despite the fact that these same characters made a point to tell her how horrible she looked 10 minutes earlier, when she had no outwardly visible symptoms. Then again, a trip to the ER, rather than to a doctor whose STD exam doesn't require the patient to remove her jeans, would have ended the movie 15 minutes in.Worst of all, the director is too cowardly to really go for the gross- out, other than the opening shot and one well-executed shot near the midpoint. Every other opportunity to make the movie truly horrifying is fumbled. For example, the medical exam could've been a terrifying ""Dead Ringers""-esque nightmare, but instead it was just stultifying nonsense.I would like to say that it's so bad it's good, but it is most decidedly not. The ability to elicit laughter might have made it passable, but instead it only elicits groans. I'm happy that the filmmakers were able to sell this dreck to some apparently rohypnol-addled exec at IFC, but they've already been paid. There's no reason to feel obligated to spend money on this mess. It'll be streaming soon enough. Skip it, unless you want to spend an evening going, ""Seriously?!?"" and ""Really?!?"" for 85 minutes. If it's low-budget gynecological horror you want, rent ""Teeth"" instead. It's disgusting AND clever.",negative
Contracted,"I gave it a high score because I think it is a very well done movie, even with a few glitches but the acting and directing deserves a lot more recognition than what some people have said on here.Najarra is lovely to start with, her acting is very good and natural. This movie made me look her up on IMDb for her other work. Her acting was convincing, as a young lady who didn't get on with her mom and in a troubled relationship. Her process of transformation was also well done, from being confused and wanted to keep it to herself at the beginning, to losing hope and wanting to get back at people (good people albeit) around her.Some on here have complained about the doctor not saying much in the first diagnosis, but that is just normal. These days you go to a GP with a bleeding girlie part, chances are they'll tell you the same and observe for a few more days. Don't forget the events portrayed by the film were supposed to be over just a couple of days, a week at most. What struck me however is that the doctor should have referred to a specialist / ER after seeing her the second time, a change in the eye colour would definitely be some viral as he said it, a normal GP would not have discharged her without raising an alert. So that would probably be the biggest glitch in the movie's logic.Others have focused on how the film doesn't answer all questions, but why should it? This film was never intended to be a detective story, it merely shows the transformation. Who cares if we don't know more about the guy who gave her the disease, he did show up at the bar paying for her drink later on and leaving with another girl, that already answers the question. He is someone with a mission to spread this to girls, maybe a big pharma agent or CIA trying to test bio weapons, who knows and who cares anyway. Also some here were left wondering what happened to the guy who fancied her, why would the film have to explain something this obvious? She caught the virus, he's gonna catch it too and go through the same transformation then... you can't expect directors to spoon feed everyone. I think it is perfectly fine and in fact great that it does't then go on to explain, the movie ended where it needed to.All in all, it deserves at least a 6.5. Given that it is not an A list movie, I'd give it a 30% mark up. Name another B grade movie that's as well done I bet you cannot.",positive
David Brent: Life on the Road,"I can't believe that the producers of BBC allowed this movie to be released in its current state. It is cringeworthy, awkward, slow and boring - even the wonderful Ricky Gervais can't save it. The screenplay is terrible.... nothing much happens, there is no conflict set up and it is too reliant on Gervais. The worse thing is the tone of the film. We laugh at Gervais' character in The Office because he has a healthy ego and is relatively successful. In David Brent, Gervais plays a guy who is basically a loser who is shunned by everyone around him. It is so sad and desperate that you can't laugh at his socially awkward moments like you do in The Office.",negative
David Brent: Life on the Road,"OK, don't shoot me, I'm a humongous Ricky Gervais fan, ever since I saw The Office for the first time, so I may not be the most objective of people. But films are made for us all, including crazy fans like me, and we're all entitled to our opinion. And my opinion is - it is brilliant and I love it. I loved cringing all the time at Brent's pathetic ridiculousness, but I also loved his humanity and true heartbreak. I don't agree the film is over-sentimental. We get a chance to see Brent's soft side, though he's trying his best to hide it, and it's great. Ricky Gervais is an absolute genius at portraying this character, and I hope it's not the last we see of him. Additionally, since I have a chance to do it here, I want to express my admiration for Ricky Gervais as a person, a beautiful person who stands up for those who have no voice. RESPECT!!!",positive
Haunter,"I suffered through the 2nd and 3rd act of this film cause I'm kind of a buff, and I wanted to see where it ended up. The acting was okay. Abigail Breslin has a way to go to be good, but she's getting her chops. The other actors were average. The biggest problem with this film is it was supposed to be creepy, but never really achieves anything close to that. The story itself is so convoluted that about a third of the way through it was already boring me winding it's way to make a point showing the same plot development over and over like Ground Hog Day. This could almost be called ""Ghostbuster meets Groundhog, the Other Story,"" since it was trying so hard to be the movie, The Others, with Nicole Kidman, but that film was far, far superior to this entry. The whole narrative ends up some weirdly conceived (in a bad way) attempt to do something original with a ghost story. It wasn't a bad idea with the basic premise as discussed above (I didn't lay out the whole story obviously), so if you decide to take this one in. I would probably suggest skipping it for a better movie like The Others, The Six Sense, or even Ground Hog day if you want scarier for the first two, and funnier, if you pick the last if you haven't seen them.I think a 3 is pretty generous for this flick. The cinematography isn't too bad or the editing. Good luck if you watch it, and see if you don't agree with me.",negative
Haunter,"I honestly was skeptical when I first heard about this movie.As a lover of indie films,i assumed it would be very low budget and have a odd plot to it. I'm glad i decided to actually watch it.Haunter takes your typical ghost story and does a complete refreshing twist to it.I did get lost a few times,but quickly caught back up on what was going on.The acting was incredibly good for a indie film,and the story was super engaging.I was always on the edge of my chair the whole movie.I highly recommend everyone to at least rent this movie and give it a chance if you're a fan of the thriller genre.I really most certainly be checking out the directors other movies as well seeing how I loved splice as well.This guy is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors",positive
G.B.F.,"The humor is fast paced, cheeky, full of innuendo, clever and sweet. The language is full of metaphors and brilliant. They talk just like the people I hang around with.

G.B.F.,"This movie is very well made,never apologizing for anything, and why should it? There is a very unPCness delivered by an excellent cast who are all fully committed to the story, and a very well written story it just happens to be. Mean girls to the extreme, and full of tongue in cheek real life truthful feelings. The entire movie has great background, and the entire screen is filled very well most of the time, so you may Enjoy this a second time. Over all I really did like this movie, It started out kind of corny, but then the characters just fell into place, and they all start to become more real, and vulnerable. More of the truth begins to slip out before it all hits the floor. So I would recommend this for Mothers to watch with their Sons, and for others to just watch it, there is a lot of good humour in here, and a good feeling or 2 to be had as well.",positive

The other thing that was just enough for me was the gorilla behavior, even they seem to know how to use a knife (and the meaning of it for a kill) and to open a door... truly people?!!

Grandma,"This is a small movie, not quite even 75 minutes long. All the characters are angry and upset the whole time. It really isn't entertaining, as far as we are concerned. Had we known more of what it was about we would not have watched it. Lily Tomlin is Elle, a 70-something lesbian whose partner had died fairly recently. When she was young, before she acknowledged her lesbianism she got pregnant, married a guy, and had a daughter. The daughter in turn had a daughter, Elle's granddaughter.That girl, 20-ish Julia Garner as Sage, is the granddaughter, a mixed up high school student. She has come to Elle this day because she needs $630 for an abortion. It is morning and she has an appointment for 5:45PM. So most of the movie is Elle and Sage interacting with various people, the boyfriend, the mother, and old friend, all to try to raise the money because Sage is broke and Elle decided to pay off all her debts and cut up her credit cards and she too is broke. The story isn't particular interesting, and the script isn't particularly well written. Basically it is a bit more than an hour of Lily Tomlin's antics and for someone who likes that then it is worthwhile. My wife and I didn't find it particularly worthwhile. When it was over we were like ""So what? These are miserable people.""",negative
Grandma,"I thought it was a great film, very enjoyable as a girl and her grandma search for the money so that she can get an abortion.The whole thing felt like it was two joints away from Being a stoner comedy, especially from the perspective of Lilly Tomilin's performance in it as the eccentric grandma with some serious baggage of her own who wishes to help her granddaughter, and on the this journey they take together the granddaughter learns a lot about her grandmother without coming all out to reveal anything. Lilly Tomilin takes first billing on the poster even though it seems like Julia Garner's character is really the center of attention as she explores Grandma's universe.I Like Sam Elliot's role in the movie as well. Maybe he was just that charming, like he was supporting Blythe Danner in I'll See You in My Dreams or I feel for the character he plays, the one time love interest of Grandma before she came out of the closet. Either way it works.It's an amusing story about family coming together when one is in need. We all should be lucky to be able to relate to what's going on. It's also about it never being too late to come though for those you love.Very humorous.",positive
Security,"Enjoyed the film. There were elements of Assault on Precinct 13, with a sample of the theme music added in at one point too. Banderas was OK but Kingsley's accent varied from Irish to Scottish at times. Not a bad way to spend 90 minutes and better some would have you believe. Action was just right and there were some unintentional funny moments too. Characters were enjoyable and the undertones were a bit obvious at times. Enjoy it with the family.",negative

Syrup,"I haven't read the book, but reading the comments it would appear as though its fairly different so I don't think this matters much as far as a review of the film is concerned.The main thing that distracted me through the whole movie was the casting of Shiloh Fernandez as Scat, other than maybe having the look of a sleazy marketer, he seemed massively out of place as a male lead. I didn't think there was any chemistry between him and Amber Heard at all, any attraction between the two seemed totally implausible. He'd probably be fine in a supporting role, but not as a lead. I was wondering the whole time if his father financed the movie or something to get him the role.Other than that the movie was OK, it did seem to be trying to hard to be cool and edgy and didn't really pull it off. Sure it had a tiny budget, but if anything doing things on a shoe string should make a movie more cool and edgy, but it wasn't at all. Everything that was meant to be cool seemed forced and clich√©.On the positive side, I thought Amber Heard was great as 6, as was her character. I can see why the ending left a few unhappy, but I think it was better to do what they did than just some by the numbers rom-com ending.",negative
Syrup,"This movie is nowhere near as clever as it believes it is. It is hip to a certain extent, but they overdo it in a big way. Marketing energy drinks with names like ""Fukk"" is clever and funny at first, especially with all that jokes that come along with it, but it gets stagnant rather quickly. There is plenty of stereotyping and sexism as well, along with breaking the fourth wall with some admittedly clever inner monologue. The story isn't strong enough, so they try to be as cool as possible. The first half isn't half-bad. It's cool, sharp, and even clever at certain points. I was kind of digging it to a certain extent. Sadly, it runs out of fuel in the second half, and turns into a mortality tale that is filled with ethics. It becomes overly serious, and it turned me off to be honest. It doesn't help that our two leads are as selfish as can possibly be. As sexy and fun as Amber Heard is, the ""enigmatic"" character of hers got on my nerves. I was able to put up with it, because Amber is so gorgeous, but her character is needlessly childish. Heard manages to overcome it all with sheer talent, and her galvanizing presence, but her character does her no favors. She didn't feel like a human being at all. Shiloh Fernandez is a tad on the blind side. His smug performance wasn't exactly endearing. His character angered me. He's a bit of a slacker, and manages to achieve success. It sent the wrong message in my opinion. His chemistry with Heard wasn't that great. Brittany Snow is always a welcome presence, but her cameo felt out of place and otiose. The worst thing about this movie might just be the ending. It tries to distinguish itself from fantasy and reality, and I didn't buy it. Overall, this movie was cold. I was left wondering what the point of it was. Everything about this movie is cold. I didn't care for it at all. It never bored me, but more substance was needed. It's just too unlikable and crass for it's own good 4.7/10",positive
The Town That Dreaded Sundown,"I had assumed that The Town That Dreaded Sundown 2014 was simply a remake of the 1976 slasher of the same name; this, I am glad to say, is not the case‚Äîit's a bit cleverer than that.The film is set in the small town of Texarkana, where a masked psycho known as The Phantom committed a series of vicious murders 65 years earlier‚Äîit is these killings that provided the inspiration for the original movie, which‚Äîin this film‚Äîis now a cult favourite amongst the town's teenagers. It is during a screening of the film that young couple Jami (Addison Timlin) and Corey are attacked by someone dressed as the Phantom. Corey (Spencer Treat Clark) is repeatedly stabbed in the back, but Jami manages to escape to tell the tale.Over the next few days, The Phantom claims several more victims; meanwhile, Jami investigates the history of the original murders (with help from archivist Nick, played by Travis Tope) in the hope of shining some light on the identity of the current killer.A little bit meta, this plot is intriguing enough to help distinguish it from all of the other remakes/re-imaginings/sequels that have plagued the horror genre in recent years, but the film also delivers the basics‚Äîscares, gore and nudity‚Äîmaking it a fun way to spend an hour and a half. The scares are sparing, but well executed; the death scenes are sufficiently nasty, with some nice and bloody effects, including the surprisingly graphic sight of a major character cut into several pieces; unfortunately, despite having a sex scene, star Timlin fails to flash the goods, leaving it to a blonde bimbo to do the honours during a motel romp.The final act, which relies on a very improbable twist, is something of a disappointment given all that has gone before, but overall I had a good time with this film. Time to revisit the original, methinks",negative
The Town That Dreaded Sundown,"Hate to tell the truth but whether or not you personally ""liked"" a film does not necessarily qualify you to review it.This reviewer was hosting horror festivals when the original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD came out, and the hardest thing to do in a horror flick is be subtle.But this director has mad skills. And can do subtle.The framing in many of the scenes is incredible, there are times you almost feel the characters on-screen are the only people left on the face of the earth.And Gomez-Rejon also is shrewd enough to get more mileage out of Addison Timlin's face than a Prius.And a nice face it is. I counted over 50 closeups and then stopped counting. Her character is the glue, the connection, for this story and she is set up as a shy girl who (quote) never gets asked out.Which is why this story is fiction and not a documentary.And you the viewer get to watch the whole story through her eyes.The juxtaposition of the new movie and the ""old movie"" only makes my point -- putting this film alongside Whedon's Cabin in the Woods for cleverly deconstructing a tale from within the story arc itself.",positive
The Road Within,"I saw Dev Patel was in this and willing to take a shot at this straight-to-video title. What a mistake.

Through the seriousness of the disorders this movie takes on (which, by the way, were beautifully portrayed by Kravitz, Patel and Sheehan) I was able to feel with them, laugh with them, and cry with them. The Tourette's Syndrome, OCD, and Anorexia that they took hold of was captivating. I could tell that a whole lot of thought was put into researching Tourette's by Gren Wells and Robert Sheehan because they gave us just enough of Tourette's. It would have been extremely easy to portray too much of ticks and mannerisms and make him look silly, but fortunately his interpretation was sincere and gave us just enough. I applaud him and the whole cast for the care they took with their characters and their corresponding illnesses. I would call this film 'careful' in the greatest way. It is extraordinary to find a director paired with an outstanding cast that take great care in their art. I loved it!",positive
A Case of You,"Chose to watch this one night when I couldn't decide what to watch and needed something quite easy. Well.. I was pleasantly surprised. This film which pitches itself as a romantic comedy actually had a bit of hidden depth in the shape of its protagonist and his issues around relationships, no doubt related to his relationship with his mum. It sounds quite serious but is quite funny really. The starry cameos, including Peter Dinklage as a camp Barista, and Sam Rockwell as a hippie guitar teacher all add to a general quirky humour. Its not amazing by any standard but if you fancy a romance which is entertaining, amusing but makes you think a little I'd recommend you give it a whirl!",negative
A Case of You,"I'll admit right up front I quit watching after an hour, not because it was bad but because it was nothing new. If you're unfamiliar with the ""manic pixie"" story, think of Natalie Portman in ""Garden State"" or Zooey Deschanel in everything she's ever done. Or if you want to get right down to it, there's the original and greatest manic pixie that ever was: Audrey Hepburn. The formula is you take 1 lovable loser guy, usually stiff, awkward or outright lame, and you pair him with a girl who is hazardously spontaneous and carefree as if she's still suffering the effects of novacaine from the dentist an hour earlier. Personally I love these kinds of films, but I love them because it's interesting to see the unique angle each one offers. But here in ""A Case of You"" there is no angle.So what we get are endless scenes of the guy making a fool out of himself and the girl pirouetting through the scenes not noticing. There's a very weak, contrived ""conflict"" (the guy is facebook stalking her), but I don't have to watch the last 20 minutes to guess exactly how it ends. I'm guessing: revelation, confrontation, reconciliation. It's the standard formula just like the rest of the story was up to the point I turned it off.You might enjoy this movie if you're not familiar with the manic pixie formula, but if you are, then watching this flick is sort of like reading a teen vampire book. You know exactly how it's going to go but you read it anyway because War & Peace gives you a headache.Where this movie fails, beyond simply being a lukewarm copy of all the others, is that there is nothing quirky about the manic pixie (Evan Rachel Wood). There is no depth, no bizarre secret past, no soul. For example, in the excellent ""Garden State"" we get Natalie Portman who is a manic pixie on the surface but we soon learn that she suffers from a spectrum of problematic mental issues like pathological lying. It gives her character complexity and makes her interesting to us. Similarly if we look at Audrey Hepburn's manic pixie (take ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"") we get the same superficial happy-go-lucky exterior but we are fully aware that she is more or less a prostitute. Again, tremendous complexity to an otherwise predictable character.But here in ""A Case for You"" there is absolutely no complexity. There is nothing out of the ordinary about either of the two, except that he's an awkward loser and she's a social butterfly.I do give it points for some excellent (yet all too brief) cameos by Sam Rockwell as a hilariously egotistical guitar teacher, Peter Dinklage as a riotously funny coffee shop barista, and Vince Vaughn as a fast talking corporate suit who ought to have a Bluetooth headset surgically attached to his head. These scenes absolutely carried the film, but ultimately the story itself gives us nothing new.Instead of this I would recommend any of the others I mentioned, as well as an unknown Japanese gem ""Shiki-Jitsu"" (Ritual) written by, and starring, Ayako Fujitani who is Steven Seagal's daughter (NO RESEMBLANCE!).",positive
The Way He Looks,"When Daniel Ribeiro's sweet and charming short film 'I Don't Want to Go Back Alone' released in 2010, I was completely in love with it. I was eagerly looking forward to watching this movie since its announcement. Though I still consider the short to be simple, nuanced and better, I liked how Ribeiro beautifully adapted the short into a feature film. Of course, he kept the same talented young actors; they've grown, and have done a commendable and mature job. I liked how Ribeiro changed a few parts from the short film, but kept the essence and feel of the story intact; he incorporates the memorable dialogues and moments from the short into the feature film appropriately.It's the story of a blind guy named Leo, his best friend Giovana, and how their lives change after the arrival of new student, Gabriel. The movie is basically about equality and sexuality. Blind, not blind, or whatever... ultimately, all we seek is love, and independence. We never choose whom we fall in love with.Though the movie explores themes of friendship, independence, bullying, etc., overall, the movie essentially remains the same as the short; I feel, the characters and situations could have been explored further. But overall, I still like the film; it's heartwarming and delightful.The title song used in the movie, 'There's Too Much Love' by Belle and Sebastian, is quite mesmerizing. Every time it played during the film, at appropriate moments, my heart was filled with joy. And the main kiss between Leo and Gabriel towards the end is really passionate and moving.",negative
The Way He Looks,"This movie is amazingly good. I already had a taste of it with the short ""Eu n√£o quero voltar sozinho"" and could not wait to watch the full movie. I had great expectations before even seeing the teasers or trailers... The movie is sweet, delicate and makes you feel so good! The characters are really well constructed. You can see how the actors improved and grew up. The dialogues flow naturally, and the camera works really well with the story. Although I already knew what would happen (because of the short) I was thrilled on many scenes. A really nice touch of the movie was to use small dialogues of the short. The movie makes you want to sit on the movie theatre for many hours. The music made me really happy. I was bobbing my head every time Belle And Sebastian was on, and could not hide my smile on the entire movie. The scenes are so well constructed that you forget that you are watching a movie - it has a dream-like feeling, even on the scenes where there is prejudice. Daniel Ribeiro did an amazing job, and so did the actors. I am in love with the story. This movie is for everyone who believes in love.",positive
Walking with Dinosaurs 3D,"Well I like millions of others love the idea of learning about dinosaurs, from children to the elderly there is just something fascinating about them. I am far from a palaeontologist, my love has come from having toys as a kid, TV shows and the Jurassic Park series, so I was so excited to see this film.I'm not sure why but I assumed a film being released on Boxing Day would be a guaranteed classic, boy was I wrong. I wont spoil the so called ""plot"" of this film, as I don't think that's fair to people who want to see it.The positives are there though, the animation and the effects are genuinely beautiful and the fact there were elements of learning in the movie is a nice added bonus especially for children. The first annoyance I had and this may sound a little cheap is that I didn't and most wont recognise any of the dinosaurs in this film, they look familiar but none of the ""classic"" or ""well known"" dinosaurs are here.The dinosaurs do have voices, but unlike any good animation film they didn't have vocal movements on the characters, all of it was dubbed over the action and sometimes it was hard to work out who was actually talking, that was my biggest complaint, something I felt was a lazy move by the creator.The plot is horrendous and extremely dull, it would have been a good hour show on the television on the discovery channel if the voices weren't there. None of the characters are that interesting and they make a very lame attempt to make the lead come across endearing and someone who you want to back for success, sadly he isn't, the film has poor character development and most of the characters are one dimensional and very irritating.I loved watching the dinosaurs and found some of it educational, but this film would have been better without the poor voices and done as an experience of the amazement that dinosaurs bring rather than a very poor story. Kids wont enjoy the story any better, I'm a huge kid film fan but this is just not a good watch.I'd recommend buying this when its in the bargain bin in a local shop and watch it without sound, just to appreciate the effects and the wonder of that era.What a waste of potential!!!",negative
Walking with Dinosaurs 3D,"Disclaimer: I marked my review as having spoilers, despite the fact that the plot is as predicable as the phases of the moon, because I ""revealed"" plot details even though you will undoubtedly know them the instant the story begins.I caught the original ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" documentary when it first aired in 2000. It was a truly groundbreaking experience, combing state-of-the-art CGI with nature documentary-style storytelling in a television program. It has held up over the years quite well, and was followed by equally-good sequels including ""Prehistoric Beasts"" and ""Monsters"".Fast forward 13 years later, and we now have a motion picture based on the name. A brand new ""Walking with Dinosaurs"", set on following the life of a Pachyrhinosaurus as he braves the Prehistoric Alaskan wilderness, encountering other dinosaurs such as the predatory Gorgosaurus and the giant, but gentle, Edmontonia, all told with beautiful cinematography and top-notch CGI.That sounds great, right? Well, what happened BBC? What the hell happened? I feel like I've been treated like an idiot. Walking With Dinosaurs: The Movie has zero charm, annoying and atrocious voice overs, a bare bones plot straight out of The Land Before Time, except without the emotion or drama, and a completely pointless frame story about a kid, his sister, and his uncle (as modern day humans, annoyingly) digging for fossils.It seems the filmmakers were originally intending on making this film a docudrama in the style of the original, and this would have been great. We would have really been invested in the individual dinosaurs as we followed them through their lives, and it would have been really immersive and engaging.But nope. Someone somewhere down the line decided that we needed half-assed, and rushed, voice overs to be able to know what the dinosaurs are thinking/doing, because apparently the studio executives think that audiences cannot understand body language, or the fact that film is a visual medium first and foremost. But given all the flak aimed at films like Avatar and Pacific Rim, they might be justified in that assumption. But the fact is is that we are smarter than that, and there was no reason to add these voice overs other than the pander to the lowest common denominator.And the fact that the voice overs sound like they were added late in production only serves to drive the point home. It sounds like the voice actors were not reading off of script, but rather watching the film and trying to do their dialogue in real time, like a bunch of 12-year old youtube commentators trying to be funny by adding voices to silent characters or animals. Then there is the fact that their is no lip-synching whatsoever. None.The story is a shadow of the plot used in Land Before Time. Main character hatches from egg and is raised by parent, his dad dies protecting him from a predator in the midst of a natural disaster (a wildfire this time around), he grows up, deals with hardships, falls in love, and comes back to beat those pesky predators, while winning the girl of his dreams. That is all there is to the plot. You cannot get any more by-the-numbers than that in this day and age.The humor is awful, because the 10-year old that wrote this script must have had some fascination with butt jokes and derivatives. Our main character has a hole in his head where the hole in the skull is, on the right side (left side in the promotional materials, for some reason). Gaze in amazement as every joke about his ""nice hole"" comes out as sounding like forced innuendo in a script that makes Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen look like a Christopher Nolan masterpiece.The music is a mixed bag. On one hand, the music used for the first Pachy migration sequence and the Edmontosaurus migration were pretty decent and fitting, and then there pop songs. In a dinosaur film. Why.Enough ranting already. The visuals are nothing short of spectacular, featuring gorgeous photography of the Alaskan geography as brilliantly-rendered dinosaurs and pterosaurs frolic amongst the landscape, with attention to detail paid in footprints and the animation.Unfortunately, anything the film gets right is immediately drown out by the ear-grating voice overs and juvenile script that serves only to pander to the youngest portion of the viewer base. Walking With Dinosaurs may be a treat for the youngsters, but older viewers who actually posses a legitimate interest in paleontology will be turned off and left confused and enraged.",positive
Reign of the Supermen,"Hated it! Hated it! Hated it!
The original writers of this story (Dan Jurgens, Karl Kesel, Jerry Ordway, Louise Simonson & Roger Stern) should be pissed. DC butchered this completely. I expected so much more and was sadly disappointed.
The original Death & Return of Superman (back in 1992 &'93) was one of the best Superman stories I have ever read and this paled in comparison. They ruined the story, they ruined the original villain (who was a GREAT villain who would never do someone else bidding) and turned him into an underling. Then they used lazy writing to add a new villain that had absolutely nothing to due with the source material.
I thought they had learned something from their 1st attempt at this with Superman/ Doomsday dvd in 2007 but I guess I was wrong.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!!!
I encourage anyone who wants a great Superman story to find the original story in the Return of Superman trade paperback or the novel The Death & Life of Superman by Roger Stern (the novel does include the battle with Doomsday). Both are incredible. It might take you a little longer to read it but it will be worth it.",negative

Getaway,"A late night car chase through the cosmopolitan streets of Sofia, Bulgaria; throbbing with that distinct and exotic coolness European cities exude when darkness falls... it's an idea that could have been executed very well. Unfortunately not in the case of Getaway, which instead slaughters the idea so poorly you can't help but feel sorry for it.¬†Everyone loves a good car chase. You won't find one in Getaway though. All the chase scenes are nothing more than a nauseating rapid succession of very brief cuts. It's literally ¬† impossible to get a wider picture and understanding of what is going. Many scenes could have been quite impressive if they had just been shot at a wider angle and held a longer frame. This does not happen once though. The breakneck speed at which the cuts are made (close up of car headlights-exploding box-back wheel-driver-back to headlights) just doesn't allow the chase to flow and is frustrating to watch. How can one appreciate what's happening when they can't even see what's happening?Selena Gomez may be trying to break out of her Disney image (and good for her) but that doesn't mean she's suited to every role. Her performance here feels weak and definitely isn't helped by an even weaker dialogue. Ethan Hawke's performance is more believable, but it's only one taste bud of sweetness in the overall bad taste this movie leaves.¬†There's pretty much zero laughs, the first half is filled with the characters bickering annoyingly, the chase scenes are visually unwatchable, it's painfully unnecessarily noisy and the plot is nothing but mediocre.¬†Fortunately I viewed the film at an advance screening and therefore given it was free I just felt disappointed, rather than feeling ripped off as I would have had I actually handed over my hard earned dollars in exchange for that mess.¬†I tried my best to enjoy the film, but to be honest all I wanted to do was getaway.",negative
Getaway,"GETAWAY (2013) 0 stars Ethan Hawke, Selena Gomez, Jon Voight, Rebecca Budig. Epically ridiculous action thriller with Hawke (dialing in his performance flatly for a quick paycheck) as a washed-up professional race car driver finding himself forced to steal a muscle car for an unknown kidnapper (Voight, shot only in extreme close ups of his jowls; ditto) who has his wife hostage and a time clock ticking. Gomez is the unlikely owner of the super up automobile who is along for the ride and arguably the most laughable 'techie nerd' ever (!) Courtney Solomon's excuse for a movie is simply to show a shiny toy speed really fast and a ton of police cars paying homage to any other action film with an unending loop of a 'chase'.

It's not a bad thing, the trailers brought me to the film, and the film kept my curiosity for the entire length. I liked it quite a bit unsurprising to you dear reader, as you've already seen my rating. The film was written & directed by it's main star, John Turturro, and what a grand achievement it is. Also starring in supporting roles and fantastic to say the least; Sharon Stone, Sofia Vergara, Liev Schreiber, Vanessa Paradis, and New York's own, film legend Woody Allen. I found while watching this film, and though the characters played by Turturro & Allen were enjoyable to watch, I was fascinated mostly with Paradis' character and her story. I'm not Jewish myself, so I'm very naive to the culture and their religious practices, and found it a interesting insight to a, I'm sure, small portion of what it may be like to be of Jewish faith. Though, and I said I was naive to the culture, it may not be entirely true. With that said, I found a film that surprised me positively and thus was quite better than I expected.",positive
The Eyes of My Mother,"Incredibly well-made. Created with a confidence and assurance of the material, I was shocked to learn that it was from a first time director and writer. Saying that, I don't think the film goes as far as it needs to. I do feel like its very short running time is felt. It's not always the easiest film to watch, it's quite disturbing in a frighteningly quiet way. It's beautifully filmed and directed, with a stunning lead performance at its core. I'll see how it fares with me over time but as of now I like it quite a bit. 2016 has been a great year for horror and this only continues that tradition. I definitely recommend this for horror fans that want intelligence in their films.",negative
The Eyes of My Mother,"Spellbinding tale of an unwell, isolated young woman who has no idea that she's unwell. Just a mesmerizing performance by Kika Magalh√£es in the lead, and shot in exquisite black and white. It's a very dark, off-putting movie, and it's definitely not for everyone. Director Nicolas Pesce makes great use of the film's short running time (under 80 minutes) and relatively claustrophobic atmosphere. VERY well done.",positive
Closed Circuit,"I had such high hopes for this movie as I am an avid Eric Bana fan. He is the only redeeming quality to this film.

The beginning starts off with a bang, literally, and then we're thrust down the road after a bomb has gone off killing XX amount of people. The idea of this movie is great, but the reveals weren't that hard to guess, and neither was the plot wholly believable. It painted the British government in a pretty harsh light, and also made the legal system look like a farce. I don't recommend this movie unless you want to lose some time of your life you're never going to get back, or unless you really love political thrillers and the main characters in the movie. The acting was solid, no complaints there, but the plot, direction, and reveals were sorely lacking in this film.",negative

It just leaves you questioning all of the things you really need to be question right now, especially with the current trial of the recent Boston Bombings. The whole movie actually holds an eerie resemblance to the whole case and does put certain ideas out there. Which is exactly where they need to be. Out here, with us, in the public. But in the end it's JUST movie, right? I see it as more of a message. It was brilliant and exactly what the world needs right now. Not only was the message perfect, but the movie was suspenseful and intense and so far the reviews don't seem to match up to the movie I saw... What's going on here, did we actually see the same movie!? I guess perception is what determines that one.",positive
Don't Think Twice,"""I think for anyone - male or female - in improv, the biggest thing to get over is the fear. I think every improviser has that."" Rachel DratchDon't Think Twice makes you think more than once about not just the enormous demands of comedy, including fear of failure, but also about doing anything for a profession that may give you little to no compensation other than the joy of doing what you love and are good at.More than anything else, this comedy makes a poignant comment on the irony of talented people making it while other talents struggle never to be recognized. Miles (writer-director Mile Birbiglia) feels it painfully as he sees Jack (Keegan-Michael Key) win a spot on Weekend Live (no doubt, Saturday Night Live) while Miles and his other colleagues labor in the lesser venue of NYC on the improv team, The Commune.As the title of their improv group suggests, their work is communal, depending on an effort for which individual spotlights have no place. Ironically, Jack wins the Weekend Live job partially by standing out doing a solo routine even though his colleagues warned him against it.Don't Think Twice does an effective job of showing the inherent contradictions of communal support and individual talent. In the matter of a romance between Jack and Sam (Gillian Jacobs), the tensions between their emerging rewards for their talent and sacrifice are subtly displayed in their loving routines and their personal love.You would not be surprised to know how difficult it would be to determine which bits in the movie are improv and which are rehearsed, so good are the performers. Even that puzzle supports a theme about the intersection of reality and artifice, a benign clash between the creative improvisation and the spontaneity of life itself. Both bring their rewards and disappointments.Here is a comedy with touches of real life--hey, I think that's what life itself is all about.",negative
Don't Think Twice,"I don't think all movies should appeal to all audiences (you cannot be everything to everybody), and my guess is this film is like an ""acid test"" for creative people. If you are not of the creative-artistic type, the movie will probably say nothing to you. However, if you do belong to that group, you'll relate to a lot of what happens to the characters in the movie, and won't get enough of it; at least that's what happened to me.Personally, some of the situations and questions discussed in the movie that I've faced myself as a member of the aforementioned group are: * Should I water down my production, in order to end the struggle of paying the rent of every month? * When you're in your 20s, there's something romantic about living like a band of gypsies, but as time goes by and everything takes more effort... where do you draw the line? * Seeing plagiarized something you never cared to protect in the first place, because you thought there was an understanding * Chickening out in the last moment from some ""big opportunity"" only because your gut feeling tells you that something's not right * Inspiration (the masterpiece that will come whenever) vs consistency (the product that, good or bad, you have to put at the door every week, following certain parameters, and nobody cares if your dad died yesterday) * That idea you have in your head and never get around to putting in paper * That work you've put in paper but never get around to submitting to other people's critique (because it's your baby) * Soul-drying day job vs still being financed by your parents at an embarrassing age The movie, like any good movie, does not provide a single answer to these questions, but each character's individual answer. Someone said in other comment that there is no character development, and I disagree; definitely all the characters end up in a different place to where they started, with lessons learned about the world, the others, and themselves.There is a small scene that resonates a lot with me; when the protagonists meet Ben Stiller and they are kind of starstruck and overwhelming him with questions, Bill congratulates him for a Herman Monster sketch he wrote, and Stiller mumbles ""that was a long time ago..."". Here is the ambivalence: saying that something happened ""a long time ago"" is a bad thing in entertainment (it means you're yesterday's news), but a good thing in art (it means you've created a piece that people can revisit time after time through the years with affection). That tension is present in the whole film: are we just the court's jester, or is there something more important in stake here? The writing of the script is very subtle, it keeps growing on you after watching it (again, if this is your kind of film). Even the characters that appear only once or twice have a lot to them, amazing tips of the iceberg.The choice of improvisation theater as the artistic discipline is also very wise; in all forms of art you are to some degree ""putting yourself out there"", but in improvisation that's perhaps more literal than in any other genre. You may have trained a lot but, when the moment comes, the piece of art is yourself, no safety net there...The actors are all great, good casting and superb interpretations. Keegan-Michael Key is great in his role as, together with Stiller, the ""celebrity-who-fights-to-stay-human"". His love story with Samantha (Gillian Jacobs) is beautiful and multi-layered, there is even a short bed scene that is treated, for a change, with humor and simple kindness, so good to see after the usual ""wrestling"" that seems to be mandatory for those scenes in blockbuster films... The beautiful Gillian Jacobs can communicate a lot of emotion without using words, and she also has a knack for comedy... Mike Birbiglia is great as the slightly disenchanted leader of the group, who lives in kind of a ""time wrap"", a windowless room where he seduces his twenty something students, waiting for the next thing to happen in his career... The enigmatic Kate Micucci is perfect in her character of Allison, the delicate and insecure girl who draws her beautiful inner world, and always can use a push from her friends.I also like the character of Lindsay (Tami Sagher), perhaps the most close to ""conventional"" among the troupe, with the blessing of wealthy parents that support her economically, which is also a curse as it increases the pressure to ""make it"". And Chris Gethard is great as Bill, a reserved guy who stays true to his principles and loyal to his friends no matter what, and in whom the balance he has achieved with his dad takes a very different shape.Like I said, perhaps it's not a movie for everybody. It's an intimate kind of movie. I feel all those characters as my friends, as someone I could hang out with, but I understand that for other people, the movie can feel petty or random, like ""why should they care"". To each their own. :)",positive
Omar,"""The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a tragedy, a clash between one very powerful, very convincing, very painful claim over this land and another no less powerful, no less convincing claim."" Amos OzIt's not easy to fit the story of Romeo and Juliet into a thriller about the Arab-Israeli conflict, but filmmaker Hany Abu-Assad does it with care and believability. So good is he in that balancing act that the notoriously endless national struggle is almost overshadowed by the challenging love Omar (Adam Bakri) has for Nadja (Leem Lubany). Palestinian Omar, an impassioned freedom fighter in a street gang, becomes ensnared in a convoluted plot as an informant after being tricked into admitting his guilt by association for an Israeli's murder. The major theme is betrayal, found everywhere, informing every life.Scaling the giant separation wall running through occupied Palestine to visit Nadja, however, is less scary than the torture Israelis inflict on him and the betrayal they demand. How he will free himself when he is caught in a covert action is the thriller part of the story.Taking the pretzel plot one step further is the trickery of getting Omar to be an informant and the torturous path he must take as the tries to play both sides. Indeed, moments occur when the audience may not be sure which side Omar is on as he fights for his life and his love. No matter, family and nationalism will be major players in his fate.The film is a powerful screed against the tactics and dominance of Israelis and a simple Shakespearean-like tale of loyalty, love, and jealousy. With the exception of Waleed Zuaiter as Agent Rami, because the actors are new to acting, they bring naturalism to the all-too-real conflict. The narrow alleys through which Omar races aptly represent the dangerous nature of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Neither Nablus nor Nazareth is filmed in any glamorous way. With the impressive claustrophobic compositions and sets, outside and inside, the director has even more skillfully shown through his star-crossed lovers that this war in not over for soldiers or lovers anytime soon:""I believe that in the long run, separation between Israel and the Palestinians is the best solution for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.""

Omar,"To start with, I want to admit that I might be biased, as this movie is a local movie, with local actors, and local financing. Therefore, my review could be affected by what is so called local patriotism.Nevertheless, I think that this movie is the best movie that I've watched in a long while. This movie tells the story of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict from the Palestinian point of view in a way that no movie did before. Yet, this movie could apply to any weak side that is living under oppression, anywhere on earth, such that everyone that has a heart can empathize with the oppressed, that is symbolized by the hero Omar. In addition, this movie contains numerous elements that one looks for in a movie: it has action scenes, dramatic events of betrayal and honesty, a pure and naive love story, friendship, funny scenes, and above all, it makes the audience ask questions and think. To conclude, this movie is a must watch as it tells a story in a moving manner (some people even cried at the end..). In addition, by watching it you'll be supporting the uprising of the Palestinian movie scene, that has many great talents.",positive
I'm So Excited!,"The film begins with the line, 'Everything in this film is fiction and fantasy; any resemblance to real life is purely coincidental'. This is acclaimed Spanish director Pedro Almodovar's opening conceit, his attempt at irony, for what is undoubtedly his worst film to date. Billed as 'A feel-good celebration of human sexuality', it neither perks you up, nor entices you to pop a cork. It is devoid of wit, originality and skill. I laughed not once. I came away feeling low and full of regret. The story ‚Äì if one can honestly call it that ‚Äì is this. A technical fault causes an aeroplane to fly around in circles until a clear runway is found for a safe landing. Meanwhile the all-gay crew entertain the eccentric passengers ‚Äì everyone from a former Dominatrix called Miss Take (hah hah), a virginal clairvoyant who claims she can smell death, a disgraced business man, a Mexican hit man and a drug mule. The crew's awful burlesque of the famous Pointer Sister song (which the film usurps for its title) ‚Äì meant to be the film's pinnacle ‚Äì turns out to be its nadir. But no. Lower depths are found, thanks to the stream- of-consciousness plot, which is a stream of banality and embarrassment. One of the crew has the bright idea of spiking passengers' drinks with the drug mule's mescaline pills ‚Äì but not without first nosing to check how well they were smuggled.Ennui becomes too much for some who decide ‚Äì I think influenced by the pills ‚Äì to let carnality take over. I should have joined the elderly gentleman who left as soon as the clairvoyant did what she really ought not to have done to the sleeping man. But, like a man determined to confront a phobia, I stayed to endure the nightmare.Please do not think this is one of those so-bad-you-must-see-it films. In case my diatribe has still not convinced you to stay away, tell me if you find this funny. A steward wipes something from the lip of another steward who has just visited the bisexual pilot. Disbelieving the reason for his disappearance, he licks his finger to confirm what he thinks it is. (Let me provide a clue: it isn't milk.)Any fool knows that a joke is not always funny in another language. So, if nothing else, Almodovar proves that the worst of American humour is a whole lot worse in Spanish.

I'm So Excited!,"Sadly this film didn't last long in one of the premiere venues in town and this has no doubt to do with lukewarm reviews the result I fear of critics' uptightness and pretentiousness. Personally I'm thrilled that the movie was so light on the surface (less so upon reflection) and totally put pedal to the metal for outrrrrageousness. I haven't had such a good time at a comedy in many many moons.And for what it's worth, while the caviar critic of one hugely prestigious newspaper in the US bemoans the fact that boring old Antonio Banderas had only a cameo, I was thrilled to see the back of him on account of there being a smorgasbord of hot hombres in just about every conceivable flavor - a notable garnish indeed to of the sustenance offered by ""I'm So Excited!"" Anyway I found it to be pretty much unassailable - perfect. I would even say that it's one of his best movies. Just because it's not as ""deep"" or cathartic as ""All About My Mother"" ""Live Flesh"" or ""Law of Desire"" doesn't mean it's flawed in any way. Thrilled that the man came out with something just like this at just this time to tell you the truth. And to the guy who writes something about ""it sets back the portrayal of gays by 10 years"" maybe you have a point and in this respect I am also delighted with the film!!",positive
Resident Evil: Vendetta,"Boring, predictable, shallow, over the top, ridiculous. The worst animated movie of the series, as bad as Anderson's movies. The only good thing is the impressive CGI, animations and details are really incredible. The rest is totally pointless. Basic plot line, one dimensional characters, absurd and not realistic situations. Plot is the same story told over and over again over the games: new villain spreads a virus, heroes fight zombies, heroes fight a final boss and save the city. There is absolutely no twist or a new focus on story that could make it more interesting.Only recommended for Resident Evil hardcore fans, casual viewers be warned: this is a total waste of time.",negative
Resident Evil: Vendetta,"I went to the one night only premiere of Resident Evil: Vendetta tonight the third C.G.I. motion picture movie of Resident Evil and I can honestly say is the best of the three.The movie deliver in more ways than one that fans of the Resident Evil series will super appreciate.First off we got to talk about how amazing the movie looks this is some of the most Phenomenal animation works I ever saw the characters and environments are so realistic that you can often forget that you're watching a Computer Generated Animated Movie the movie crew hired actors for motion capture to show case how real the characters look and move on screen they all deserve points for doing such a great job to make the movie look so great.The voice acting is top notch with in my opinion the voice work and characters Chris Redfield (Voiced by Kevin Dorman) Rebecca Chambers (Voiced by Erin Cahill) Leon S.Kennedy (Voiced by Matthew Mercer) Glenn Arias (Voiced by John DeMita)bringing great performances that really shows amazing work it makes you feel like you really watching a drama play done so well the voice work the cast does is so well done with the writing being very smart the writers took their time that's for sure.The story really is powerful throughout with the writing again being well through out. The cast performances also helps the story makes you draw into the plot to wonder what will happen next.The action in the movie is awesome it felt like you're playing the game and the effects are impressive barely enough time to rest as the action keeps you on the edge of your seat as you wait to see what goes on next.The only thing this movie needs is a mic drop because it really show why Resident Evil has had such a success the movie is made for fans of movies and Resident Evil. I will no doubt be glad to watch this movie over and over again.With amazing C.G.I Animation,Excellent Voice acting, Strong powerful story and action that leaves your jaw drop you really will love this movie.I give Resident Evil: Vendetta an 10 out of 10",positive
Comet,"One of the most pretentious movies I have ever watched. The main guy character is an unlikable, self-important asshat right from the start, in a way that should be obvious to everybody - except, apparently, the main girl character. She likes it, goes right along with his ""I'm the smartest man alive"" schtick, and delivers some crazy chick attitude in return. The writers worked hard to make narcissistic, sociopathic character traits appear quirky and cute. They're not. They're narcissistic and sociopathic. Couple that with clumsy exposition, wooden dialogue, and wannabe ""aha!"" moments, and it all turns into a major trainwreck. I'm guessing the actors did the best with what they were given to work with. However, the result should appear highly unlikable to any human being with a shred of actual empathy. Comet is a movie that looks good on paper, but unfortunately, does not deliver on its promise at all. Unless we're supposed to find these two painfully annoying, in which case, congratulations.",negative
Comet,"Hollywood movies rarely move me as the formula used is predictable, with most endings being predictable shortly into the film. If you are looking for the Americana white picket fence house in the suburbs, two kids and a dog relationship this is not for you. Comet is a statement on love between two people looking for love who have the unsocial ability to speak their mind, the truth. Truth hurts, and without the ""skills"" to cushion their raw feelings they do hurt each other. Its a beautiful refreshing approach to viewing a relationship, magically crafted by the filmmakers by interweaving the 6 year timeline of their relationship leading up to the final scenes. A film to show this narrative needed two actors who could bring the characters to life and make you believe, outstandingly accomplished by Justin Long and Emmy Rossum. Please realize most of this entire film is carried by these two actors, the supporting cast is small but excellent, the cinematography is captivatingly beautiful, and the musical score integrated perfectly, adding up to a great movie experience. I gave this film a 10, which I never do, to counterbalance the rating of people who obviously did not take the time to take this journey.

The Vatican Tapes,"You immediately question the direction of the movie because of it's focus on surveillance footage only to have no real purpose of the footage. The camera work is terrible. The main character's hair, why is it always side parted and perfect? The entire theater booed when it ended. Too many plain plots. The music score is cheap. Too many scenes of the Vatican for no reason. The use of an actor from 90210 only makes movies less believable. The casting director should be fired and never work in Hollywood. Props to the CGI people for doing what they could with this baddie. They all need acting coaches. This movie probably was very fun and funny to film. I never write reviews. Wrote this one because I became so frustrating with this movie. It has no integrity and no body. Very empty. Should have gone straight to VHS, not even DVD or netflix.",negative

A.C.O.D.,"This movie was one of those films that you just keep watching not because it's good, but because you find yourself trying to figure out the point of the story throughout its lame phases of development. Just like back in the day when American Beauty won the Oscar for best picture, or that other incredibly stupid movie Little Miss Sunshine, this is one that could be similarly categorized as unworthy of even obtaining funds for production! Extremely pointless & disappointing. Adult Children of Divorce (ACOD) should seek counseling if they are unable to re-immerse in healthy, social relationships. Additionally, while I do understand this film was labeled as a comedy and some of the actors in the movie are known to play in comedic roles, this movie was the antonym of humorous. In fact, is was absolutely painful to watch!",negative
A.C.O.D.,"A.C.O.D. is such a terrific film that it's difficult to believe that it's Zicherman's directorial debut. The screenplay, by Karlin and Zicherman, is remarkably clever and witty--combining humor with poignant insight to a very satisfying effect. Zicherman gets the pacing exactly right, showing faith in the intelligence of his audience by never belaboring a point. The characters are engaging and the acting is very great. If your an adult child of divorce or a divorced parent who worries about your children, you're likely to recognize something in this film. (When Carter goes through his parents' divorce papers, try to catch some of the petty, ridiculous allegations each makes.) In this film, you see revealed some painful truths about human nature and complex family relationships--always with humor and compassion. This is one of the best comedies I've seen.",positive
Welcome to the Jungle,"Very bad modern parody of a great book: ""Lord of the flies"". Don't even worth to be seen for free... Lets say that Van Damme character is Simon (not a nice Simon as in the book but...); Adam Brody is Ralph and Rob Huebel is Jack. Also, Kristen Schaal is Piggy and Aaron Takahash Roger. Kristopher Van Varenberg could be the twins... who knows... Out of the Island, Phil (Huebel) is Chris (Brody)'s boss. He's an abusive boss, seconded by his right hand, Troy (Takahash). As the manager of the company feels his employees are not team players, he send them to an island to bond. The plane lands, the pilot dies and a very boring parody of ""Lord of the flies"" begins... It's not funny, it's not entertaining, it's just a waste of time.",negative
Welcome to the Jungle,"I thought this movie was really funny. The jokes and dialog was great (I actually did laugh through the whole show) and overall it was just an enjoyable escape. I thought all the actors did a great job, but I especially loved seeing JCVD do something different. Turns out, he's a pretty funny guy. I guess if you were expecting him to throw out a few karate kicks, that might be a let down. But I walked in just hoping to be entertained, and I definitely was. I don't watch that many comedies, so when I see one I like to laugh, not walk away more depressed than when I sat down. I wish more comedies were like this, because I would probably see more of them.",positive
I Am Not an Easy Man,"The film portrays a world where gender roles are reversed. All well and good, but it lacks any subtlety or nuance. Reversed means reversed - 180 degrees. Women wear suits and pee standing up - they basically are men, but with higher voices. Sure, it highlights just how gross men can behave, but it could have achieved greater impact by showing an alternative world where eomen are on top, but without resorting to gross behaviour. The result is a film where the two main characters are totally unsympathetic, and our interest and commitment soon wane.
A wasted opportunity, sadly.",negative
I Am Not an Easy Man,"People reviewing this movie poorly have missed the point. There is an ending and it is supposed to shock you into realising that this is the way the world actually is for women and how sad it is that this is reality.
I too wondered if they couldn't have made the feminine qualities dominant and masculine submissive but on further reflection, I think the way it was done was just right.
By flipping the gender roles so purely it is a great demonstration of how women live in this society.
I love, love, love the way Women's bodies are shot by the camera, just structurally without any sexualisation, this was very clever!
The film seems silly and fun on the surface but it relays a great message.
After watching this film with my (very straight, very white) father he came to the conclusion that maybe he had been underestimating how hard it is for women in our society (a big deal).
Please share this film with the men in your life and enjoy the sweet feeling of being understood.",positive
Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead,"This movie is (like part 1 before) really something else. Goofy, gory, funny, disgusting, ""politically incorrect"" slaughterhouse with excellent FX and a touch of Monty Python. Absurd at its best. Obviously, this could be filmed only in Europe (despite some American actors), in a country an abundance of sense of humor (like Norway in this case). This is also a rare occasion where the sequel is even better than the first part (and leaves room for more; looking forward to it). I mean, zombie movie cannot be fun if it is not really funny and entertaining (both for crew involved and the viewers). The director knows very well that the whole ""zombie thing"" is ridiculous and absurd in itself and takes such approach. No one should take this seriously (simply disregard ""historic"" part) and it does not insult viewers' intelligence. Just enjoy. Of course, if you missed part 1, don't miss it. Watch both one after another. Highly recommended.",negative
Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead,"Everything in zombie movies has been done to death (see what I did there?). And yet, here comes a movie that actually adds to the genre whilst simultaneously disgusting me and making me belly laugh. And not one of those infectious belly laughs. You know, when you are in a theatre and something mildly amusing on-screen sends a ripple through the crowd which grows; mostly because the girl down the front has a weird cackling laugh that morphs into a full-on snort fest, and that just sets everyone else off. Yeah, well, it's not like that.I was on my own. And I laughed out loud multiple times. I genuinely LOLed. That's as rare as rocking horse faeces. Dead Snow 1 was a revelation; a brilliant twist on the genre. Dead Snow 2 adds again. The comedy elements are ratcheted up as is the budget. A budget wisely spent on special effects and sheer scale. If you are after genuine chills and insights into the human condition, Dead Snow 2 will leave you cold (see what I did there too?). But if your appetite runs to comedic gore in the vein of Peter Jackson's 'Brain Dead', you will love this one.",positive
Emelie,"It seems these days all I do is write reviews trashing movies. If a movie is good, then great, no need to come here and try and help my fellow users warning them to avoid it like the plague.But in the case of the truly terrible movies which somehow have decent enough reviews and ratings to sucker me in, that I then watch and wish I could get the 2 hours of my life back I feel COMPELLED to come here and give them bad reviews in the hope of convincing others NOT to waste their time.So on to the the movie, with a couple of spoilers (if indeed it is even possible to spoil something with no twists, turns or tension): Good horror needs somewhat realistic situations, with people doing somewhat realistic things, that we would all do (which then fail, or are thwarted by the villain). Think Nightmare on Elm St from the 1980s. OK the whole thing takes place in a dream, with a long dead killer stalling the kids through their nightmares.This is utterly unbelievable, but the characters try and survive and battle Freddy in a realistic way. And the more he outsmarts them or the worse things get the more the terror mounts.SPOILER: None of that happens here. Why does this psycho baby sitter go to all this trouble, when she could have just snatched the kid in the first 2 minutes? She's all busy trying to drug the kids, and playing creepy games with them...WHY? There's no logic or tension at all.She has a male henchman, who is desperate to be part of her plan, and while he's out stalking the parents so they don't come home from their date unexpectedly she phones him and says ""I need more time"".For what?? JUST RUN with the kid! What on earth is this plotting? She gets access to the house and then just hangs out rather than just bolting out of there with the kid she wants under her arm.This idiot then decides that to give her 'more time' he won't drive as fast as possible back to the house so he can grab her and flee with the stolen kid. Oh no, this guy decides he will *ram his car into the parents as they drive home from their date and die in the ensuing crash*.Huh? Worst plotting ever. There is no logic, no fear, no real edge of your seat nail biting terror. This movie is a long sequence of the supposed really smart killer babysitter making the absolute worst possible decisions about how to steal the child she is obsessed with because (spoiler alert): She lost her own child previously. Damn, just grab the kid, jump into your weirdo male accomplice's car and get the hell out of there...Which is what I advise you to do rather than watch this trash - get the hell out of there!SKIP this movie.It's also a far too big a role for the lead actress Sarah Bolger, who is cute and very girl next door - she reminds you of about a dozen other young actresses in this mold, nothing unique about her and you could have slotted pretty much an other actress into this role. Sadly she cannot carry a movie, especially not one as poorly written as this. This is made even more noticeable as the three young kids run rings around her for acting and commitment to the role. They are all great.Script: 2/10 Acting: 4/10 Thrills: 1/10 Desire to smack the scriptwriters right in the face for the absence of fear and tension in a thriller? Oh that's 10/10 for sure.",negative
Emelie,"So many disturbing situations in this film. Whenever you mix kids into a movie, it can either get creepy (Children of the Corn), or you feel really bad for the manipulated children, which was the case for this film.Sarah Bolger does an excellent job going from nice girl next door to psycho babysitter. And all the kids do a great job too, especially Thomas Bair, who plays the littlest brother, Christopher. I wouldn't classify this one as horror, but more as a psychological thriller. Although it didn't have a lot of tension, I still was transfixed, waiting to see what fresh hell Emelie would do to the children next. I really enjoyed it, and would have given it five stars, but there were some holes in the plot that were pretty big (especially towards the end), and a couple of things that weren't really explained.There are scenes that involve sexual situations with the children, that may really be a trigger for some folks. If this is you, you may want to skip this one. But otherwise, I say give this one a watch.",positive
Phantom,"Ed Harris did a great job as the lead. Kudos to him. Trust me when i say i know a lot about subs. If you see this movie, don't expect to learn anything new about cold war soviet subs. Horribly inaccurate but lets remind ourselves, THIS IS A MOVIE MEANT FOR ENTERTAINMENT! Not for learning facts. There is no way tho that this could happen. The whole ""Phantom"" thing device. We still have limited understanding of what the ""Phantom"" device can do in reference to what it did in the movie today. My advice, rent it from the library. What kind of soviet submarine would have a claustrophobic missile officer? Could have thought that through a little better. If you want a good sub movie, watch one of the following. Hunt for Red October, K-19 the widomaker, U-571, or a documentary. All in all watch it for the excitement. Lots of heart racing Acton. A little to much blood tho.",negative
Phantom,"Not a fan of war movies or cold war submarine movies, BUT went to see this because Ed Harris and Lance Henriksen were in it. To my complete surprise it drew me in and would not let me go. They obviously used an authentic submarine and the claustrophobic, this sub is going to just implode any minute feel, had me on edge. The cast included David Duchovny, William Fichtner, Sean Patrick Flannery, Johnathan Schaech, etc.. Did it have ' ""action"" - yes, but the meat of the movie was the interaction of the characters, the terror of the time - nuclear annihilation, personal guilt, love, friendship, bravery, and hatred and fear that breeds radical actions. You will regret not seeing this movie!",positive
Ain't Them Bodies Saints,"I'm on the fence with this one. I don't hate it quite so much as to give it one star, as I'm tempted to. The direction and photography feel like a year 10 high school project. True beauty is best captured inconspicuously on film, whereas Saints is obsessed with getting the perfect shot of shivering fir trees and fields of barley coated in gold at sunset - there's no nuance or subtlety to it. It appears ham fisted when the director is obviously choosing his shots carefully, but when he lets intuition guide him he manages to capture some great moments on film.Like one scene where Rooney Mara's character leaves church, and the local sheriff gives her a tip of a hat outside in a short tracking shot to the tune of a quirky soundtrack - it's simple and effective. Most viewers won't even remember that tiny twenty second scene and are probably too busy salivating over Casey Affleck's felt hats and film student mise en scene. That being said, while the photography is desperate to impress, the way scenes play out is more effective. The director has some idea of how to generate tension, but at times he flops. The opening action sequence is one example; boring, flat, over quickly. Though perhaps what success there is is more to the credit of the screenwriter than the director, it's hard to say.Flaws to one side, there are several small, tender moments that elevate Saints. For example, the interactions between Rooney Mara's character and her daughter, which are, at times, heartwarming, and very natural. Ben Foster too, feels well-casted and is careful not to turn his small town sheriff character into a walking clich√©. In fact, he did so well you barely noticed him at all. He blends perfectly into the background. Casey Affleck seemed to recycle his character from ""The Killer Inside Me,"" but his performance was tolerable.So, all in all, Saints makes a lot of swings for few runs, succeeding just enough to be an honourable mention. I understand this is one of the director's first works, so for a debut it is certainly noteworthy. If he can learn to stop grovelling at the feet of critics he may improve in the future.",negative
Ain't Them Bodies Saints,"Enjoyed ""Ain't Them Bodies Saints"". Good story which needs some touching up, but the acting is first rate. It is a character study, a study in melancholy told in real, human terms and not in movie terms. And maybe that is its only flaw, that truth be told, real life is less dramatic and more grimy than make-believe. Briefly, he is a crook, she is his wife/girl (it's not explained) and the two are caught in a shoot-out with police. She fires a gun wildly out a window and accidentally hits a policeman. He takes the rap, goes to jail, she has a baby and waits for him to come back.The nominal star, at least when the movie credits rolled, is Casey Affleck, but the real star is Rooney Mara, who is excellent as the single mom waiting for Affleck. It is an earthy, sensitive portrayal of a distrustful woman on the defensive. She has made great strides since ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"", a one-dimensional performance. The raw-boned Affleck plays tougher than he looks and underplays his role here. Keith Carradine was a surprise in a strong supporting role.In my opinion the picture could use two things; tightening up and punching up. There are some dead spots throughout and the film seems longer than 105 minutes, although, as I said, real life is not always supercharged. But there must be a middle ground or else the narrative becomes sluggish. Also, no explanation was given for the 3 strangers in town. Were they Magi? The Three Stooges? We are left to wonder, and director Lowery should have given us more information in this instance.It is very worth seeing and brightens a dreary summer full of sequels and explosion movies. If you are seeking respite from the likes of ""Smurfs 2"", go see this one. It's for grown ups.",positive
The Other Side of the Door,"I saw this movie at 10:20AM on Saturday, in a completely big empty theater with my party of three (including myself). Now, when I saw the preview for the film, I was very intrigued. I wanted to know what happened, so I was shocked when one of my main movie theaters was playing it but then yet again, it's an indie theater. Now the whole set design of this film, was great. I thought it was something new to set it in India and it's a original idea. They actually payed respect to the culture. Now some of the jumpscares were annoying, but only some. They had great effects though for the 'gatekeeper', no CGI actual makeup. The performances were solid, the little girl wasn't atrocious, but she fitted her character well, nothing great, it's like she-just- acts-for-that-scene. Sarah Wayne Callies was much better than she needed to be, Jeremy Sisto was sort of just there, but he did well. The director tried to take this new approach to the film, which worked most of the time. It has old-classic scares like piano playing by itself, chairs moving, books falling, etc. Not really any new scares. This isn't the must see horror film of the year, but it's a solid watch with a very clever ending.",negative

Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie,"I was really hoping this would be as funny and clever as the TV series, unfortunately it was torture to sit through, i so wanted to get up and leave and tbh i wouldn't have missed a thing if i did as it didn't get any better. It was an even keel of rubbish.I can't believe the BBC were behind this embarrassing movie, i guess they saw ¬£pound signs first, which is fair enough but PLEASE make a bit of effort at least! And i couldn't believe when the credits rolled to reveal that Jennifer Saunders wrote the screenplay.I remember Keith Lemon:The Film getting panned by the critics and public, this is easily as bad or worse!The celebrity cameo's in this movie were embarrassing to watch and they will surely regret there decisions to be in this once they see it for themselves. And the non ""celebrity"" actors/actresses involved seemed as if they were pulled off the street, very amateur and over the top, like Edina's granddaughter Lola for example.The movie felt sooo cheap considering the glamour involved with the characters. Patsy and Edina did the best they could to wring laughs from every situation but it just didn't work...i just can't believe Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley went through with this without some sort of clearer plan to make it a fun movie at least even if it wasn't as laugh-out-loud, i mean there TV shows were all well made! It felt like it was trying to be a American comedy movie in its form but it came across more like those cheap and nasty cash-in American spoof movies like Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, etc., which you would probably get more laughs from tbh.In an audience of about 30 people there was only a few slight giggles from a couple of people throughout the whole film which isn't really enough to qualify as a comedy success sorry to say. I watched Central Intelligence last week and that had the same audience reaction BUT it was a fun movie and i left with a smile on my face so i gave that an average 6/10, just for the fun factor.I liked the Absolutely Fabulous trailer so all i can say is if you like the trailer then just be prepared for that to be the best thing about this whole project.1/10",negative
Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie,"I have loved Ab Fab from day one, back in 1992 and have a boxset I sometimes still dig out and watch when I have time.

That's how much I love the series and had been looking forward to the film hitting the cinema!I love the characters Eddy and Patsy - always thought Jennifer Saunders is hilarious, even when she was still doing French and Saunders. Joanna Lumley looks fantastic though and what a great actress with perfect comedy timing at 70! - and this movie delivers its familiar in your face parody of the fashion scene and PR business, showing how pretentious they are with sharp satire. It returned to everything that was witty in the first few series, with outrageous behaviour from the lead characters.

Open Windows,"I hate writing bad reviews. I really do. Bad reviews aren't helpful and only serve to make well-meaning artists feel bad about their work. They worked hard on their piece. Submitted for your approval. ""Open Windows"" Overly complicated. Overacted. Overly stupid and in some choice ""nuggets"" of scenes, I found myself cringing from embarassement- you know the feeling, like when your chin gets pulled down to your neck and your face turns red? And yet I *still* gave it 7 stars. Why? It was weird fun and I stuck with it to see what happened next. There certainly are worse films for sure, but not too many ""Golden Turkeys"" like this one.",negative
Open Windows,"OPEN WINDOWS is a high-concept thriller that works better as an exercise in form and style than as a movie. Directed by Nacho Vigalondo, and starring Elijah Wood and Sasha Grey, the story is about a guy named Nick Chambers (Wood) who wins a date with actress Jill Goddard (Grey) through an online contest. After finding out the date has been canceled, a mysterious stranger named Chord (who claims to be affiliated with Jill) allows Nick to watch her secretly from his laptop, and things start to get crazy from there.When I first started watching this, I was reminded of a couple of films that Elijah Wood did before this one: MANIAC and GRAND PIANO. I thought of MANIAC because every shot in this movie is from the first person point of view, and of GRAND PIANO because his character is constantly being given instructions by a mostly unseen third party. What I thought this film did effectively was integrate technology in an interesting way, and the way the story was presented was at least creative. It takes a while to get used to, but once you accept the concept then it's easier to get into the film. It's actually not too bad of a film either, for the first two-thirds of it. You have this rather timid individual who is given the opportunity to spy on someone he admires through the miracle of modern technology, and when things start to go wrong the film is able to maintain a good level of tension. Nothing in this film is predictable, and that is probably the highest praise I can give it. Still, despite the modern trappings it is rather silly and convoluted. I won't give away any twists, but it takes a turn about two-thirds of the way through that kind of ruined the experience for me.As far as the acting is concerned, nobody really gave a bad performance, but nobody was spectacular either, including Elijah Wood who seemed to be doing another variation on the type of character he's played in his last couple of films. Sasha Grey wasn't too bad, but I wasn't expecting too much from somebody who came out of porn. Overall, I thought that the story, as implausible as it was, started out pretty good but then derails in the final act. There were some good observations on obsession with celebrities and the terrifying possibilities of modern technology, but it is mostly lost in a standard thriller. It's being billed as a 21st century REAR WINDOW, but most people would probably be better off watching that instead.",positive
The Gallows,"Do not, I repeat, Do not fall for the made up 10 star reviews...( It's obvious those affiliated with producing this garbage want to pique the interest of others so they give fake ratings & reviews, hoping others will be interested enough to see it- & they make more $$) Take it from me, Wasting my $ & time on this terrible so-called ""movie"" left me leaving the theater very upset I wasted $ on this trash & annoyed. All found myself wanting to do, was to drop-kick the blonde, camera-holding, guy. (.Whoever decided THAT guy has any talent in acting, needs to have their heads examined.,I can only surmise he has a family connection or paid to be in the film) The story/ acting was way too cheesy to be scary. I have nothing positive to say about this film. It was just plain junk. When I went to see it, it was opening weekend, therefore, there weren't many reviews or ratings accumulated to get a real idea of whether or not it was going to be any good. I believe this crap actually had a 6.1 rating...Now, for horror movies- I considered that to be relatively high ( even from just a couple hundred ratings) Wow, was I duped!! Now,after seeing ( most of ) the movie ( ended up walking out, it was THAT BAD) and then seeing the 10 star reviews, I KNOW the ratings on here can't be trusted...( until you see at least 5,000 - 10,000 people rated it) SO- save your $ , time & irritation -skip this boring, sad excuse & find something better...",negative
The Gallows,"I remeber when I first saw the trailer for this movie, and it scared the hell out of me. When it came out on iTunes (the most convenient place for me to watch it), I immediately rented it without reading the reviews. I loved it. I consider myself a horror movie buff. I'm so desensitized to horror movies that I fell asleep during The Exorcist. However it took me hours to fall asleep after The Gallows. The ""villain"" was depraved, yet relatable, the scares happened when you least expect them to, and the setting was perfect.
The next day, I went to IMDB to review it, and was horrified to see the reviews. People have trashed this movie for no reason. Maybe they just don't come in contact with modern high school students, because the actors pulled off their roles marvelously.",positive
Batman: Gotham by Gaslight,"Batman Gotham by gaslight I believe is based off a comic. I can't remember much of the interview so do bare with me.I am sorry but I am just not impressed with the movie at all. The whole story was predictable over who was behind the murders of those women that got killed by Jack the Ripper. I will give it some credit since the animation is good quality and the voice cast was really good. Especially since it was nice hearing Bruce Greenwood voice Batman again and I am looking forward to hearing him again in season 3 of Young Justice. Well at least we never had weird shippings like Batman and Batgirl/Nightwing and Harley Quinn seriously? God knows what was Timm thinking when he was making those movie. Now this? Even though Justice League Gods and monsters chronicles was messed up and nearly killed the DC Universe at least the movie made up for it (see my reviews). This on the other hand is just student work i mean seriously: Jim Gordon is the ripper?, Tim, Dick and Jason are orphans running the on the streets and are raised by some mugger to steel?, Barbra Gordon is a psychopath?,I could go on and on but I am going to end my review here.",negative
Batman: Gotham by Gaslight,"Decent story; pathetic, ultra-cheap, non-animation! It looks like they had told the basic story line to a bunch of completely talentless 5th-graders and told them to ""take some hard-lead ugly-colored pencils and draw us some pictures of this story.""",positive
A Haunted House 2,"I have not seen the first ""A Haunted House"" film, but after sitting through this dreadful sequel I don't think I would like to. Why this trashy unpleasant film was released on Easter weekend is beyond me.There is no coherent story. Upon getting over an ex-girlfriend who got possessed by evil spirits, Malcolm hooks up and moves in with a new girl Megan and her two kids. What follows is an embarrassing mishmash of scenes from recent big hits in the horror genre, ""Sinister"", ""Insidious"" and ""The Conjuring,"" as Malcolm continues to be terrorized by demonic events. Marlon Wayans plays Malcolm in the most irritating and annoying manner, with his non-stop loud screaming and nonsensical ranting. He has a prolonged, uncomfortable and unfunny sex sequence where Marlon gets it on with a doll that looks like the diabolical Annabelle from ""The Conjuring"". More awful jokes of such sick sexual nature would recur through the rest of the film.You go into a spoof film like this to have a shallow laugh out of jokes inspired by your favorite horror films. However, within the first few minutes, you already get the feeling that this film will not entertain you at all. In fact, it could even be quite boring, with very long humorless scenes that overstay their welcome. There are many scenes which would offend pet lovers, Catholics, Mexicans, women, and practically everyone else. I found it interesting only when it tries to recreate a recognizable scene from those modern horror classics, like the group hanging from ""Sinister"" or the ""Hide and Clap"" game from ""The Conjuring"". But unfortunately, I wind up disappointed because its spoofing just falls terribly flat. I would have had a good time if a film was dumb and funny, but this film is just plain dumb, not funny. 1/10.",negative
A Haunted House 2,"I have not been usually a fan of Marlon Wayans in movies. I loved his brother Damon and loved the family in sketch comedy in In Livin Color. But in Scary Movie I thought he over played his parts. So much that it wasn't funny. And White Chicks was only funny because of Terry Crews. In face the only Scary Movie I liked was the ""Grab my Little Hand"" one and the one with the Spoof genius Charley Sheen who dominated Hot Shots and Part Deux in a way that would make Monty Python or Mel Brooks proud. A Haunted House 1 fell short as well although some parts made me snicker. A HH2 though was pure genius. I can see a lot of people not getting the humor but I'm pretty sure anyone my age understood it perfectly. Us 90's kids grew up hearing these type laughs. From them moving in all the way to the Warrans I laughed and laughed out loud non-stop. I am definitely buying this and watching it until I wear it out and the humor isn't funny anymore. Give it a shot and don't worry about the plot. Just listen to Marlons take on women problems, and how he handles or should I say can't handle the paranormal. All stereotypes are touched just as the Great Dave Chappelle. Actually that is a perfect reference. If you liked the Dave Chapelle show and laughed hard at that, you'll love this. If not, then go watch CSI or How to Lose A Guy In 10 Days. You will be better off",positive

Perfectos desconocidos,"""Perfectos Desconocidos"" is a Spanish remake of the Italian movie ""Perfetti sconosciuti""; both have been very successful in its own country; but as I am from Spanish origin; I prefer the Spanish one.
Seven friends everyone with his own crisis reunites for a dinner in a house. Somebody proposes a game; left all cell phone on the tables so everybody can see secrets of the others.
Things get unexpectedly complicated as a secret of each person is being revealed. 
There are outstanding comedy moments and suspenseful as well. One particular conversation between a father and her daughter carriers more tenderness than any flick released in 2017.
This kind of movie can only works with outstanding actors; and all of them are.
It will be unfair to point on one in specific since this is coral movie; however Eduard Fernandez and Ernesto Alterio are both commanding.
In brief; it is perhaps the best 2017 comedy; with the Italian original being the best of 2016.",positive
The Good Neighbor,"""The Good Neighbor"" follows the antics of 2 teenage boys (Ethan and Sean) 'haunting' and surveilling an old man (Harold Grainey) that they dislike, all in the name of conducting a 'sociological experiment', in the hopes of generating a million views on youtube. Eventually, we learn that this just isn't some innocent experiment, and the old man isn't what they thought he was.The movie opens with a narration of how perception isn't always reality, and that people see only what they want to see. And this is really what this movie is about. The old man that everybody views as despicable and hateful is really just an old man that's hurting from the loss of his wife and wants to be left alone. While the old man's strange behavior may seem psychotic to others, especially to the two voyeur teenagers, in reality it's just the actions of an old man trying to deal with pain and reacting to the paranormal activity, in his own self-destructive way of course. It's an interesting lesson of how outside influences, regardless of how innocent, can have an enormously unpredictable outcome.However, the antics of these kids isn't so innocent, most especially are the motives of Ethan. He keeps trying to push the old man, even when confronted and challenged by his partner in crime. We soon learn that this 'experiment' has as much to do with revenge as it does a study in human behavior. We learn that there is a history between Ethan's family and Mr. Grainey (very appropriately named I might add), and Ethan's bias toward the old man only fuels his speculation that he is up to no good. Ultimately, Mr. Grainey pays the ultimate price as a result of the actions of the two juvenile delinquents.I generally found this movie kind of hard to watch because the characters were so unlikable. Ethan, the true villain in this movie, I found to be truly despicable. His cohort Sean has a conscience but isn't able to think on his own and is compelled to be around Ethan because of his own insecurities and social awkwardness. Ethan's mother is so wrapped up in her own world that she basically lets Ethan do whatever he wants. And Mr. Grainey, for better or worse, was made out to be so horrible by the narrative that even when we learn that he's a lonely, albeit mean, old man that garners sympathy, it's hard to put aside the initial feelings about him and his overall bad traits.However, the climax with Ethan hiding in the house with his gun drawn and Mr. Grainey standing in the same room with his gun drawn is truly a gripping scene, and basically saves the movie from being a total disaster. And it serves as a reminder to us all that we all live in our own perceptions of reality.",negative

The English Teacher,"In Kingston, Pennsylvania, the forty-five year-old lonely spinster Linda Sinclair (Julianne Moore) is a high-school English teacher with a routine life that loves literature. When she stumbles with her former student Jason Sherwood (Michael Angarano), she learns that he has returned from New York after failing as a playwright in Broadway. Linda borrows his play named ""The Chrysalis"" to read and she loves the play. Then she shows ""The Chrysalis"" to the drama teacher Carl Kapinas (Nathan Lane) and they decide to produce the play in the high-school. However Vice Principal Phil Pelaski (Norbert Leo Butz) and Principal Trudie Slocum (Jessica Hecht) are against the production since the conclusion is too dark for the students and they can not exceed the budget. Carl offers to change the ending and Linda offers to cover any amount that exceeds the budget. However, along the rehearsals, the naive Linda learns that real life is not a literature and people are flawed and may disappoint.""The English Teacher"" is an unpleasant movie with despicable characters; Julianne Moore's actress and her character are the only attraction of this movie. Jason Sherwood is a liar and ungrateful character; Carl Kapinas is a sophisticated ridiculous character incapable to keep and assume his own word; Halle Anderson and Will are among the worst that you can expect from teenagers. Linda Sinclair is unselfish teacher that sponsors the production of the play for love for the art, but is not supported by the selfish Jason Sherwood and Carl Kapinas and has her career destroyed by the disgusting Halle Anderson and Will.

The English Teacher,"This is one of those indie movies that is much better than many big budget feature film comedies.The story combines original comedy, a touching partly dramatic climax and a feel good plot that comes together perfectly. The comments on screen are an original touch. No wonder such a top notch cast appears in it.The performances are stellar. Julianne Moore gives a wonderfully varied and moving performance as a spinster English Teacher in high school who mounts the play of an ex student played by Michael Angarano. She can do comedy just as well as she does drama and biopics. The supporting cast includes Broadway veterans Jessica Hecht and Norbert Leo Butz as school principals, Nathan Lane as the diva of a drama teacher, the lovely Lily Collins as a high school student and aspiring actress and finally Greg Kinnear as the young playwright's father.This is one of the best indie comedies in years and deserves much more critical acclaim and financial success than it received. Look forward to seeing more from the screen writing duo who penned the story.",positive
Hours,"What a poor last showing for someone who appears to be such a nice guy. I don't understand how this film is getting such good reviews other than sympathy for a recently departed actor. The dialog was amateurish and the plot was unbelievably ridiculous! Walker did a good job acting and overall the movie is watchable unless you are one to have a hard time watching a story line that is utterly impossible and unbelievable - c'mon... 1 min and 45 seconds to run up to the roof (pausing along the way), attempt to flag down a chopper, yell at the neighbors, and then return?!?!

Yet I can indisputably say without being biased, that he played this role with excellence.OK, so the move was not a fast paced action or romantic, date flick, but it was a well written realistic Drama / Thriller.While the ending may have been somewhat predictable. The rest of the film with it's characters and plots certainly was not. You will find quite a few surprises.I am sure it will do well if/when it's released in theaters around the world. What a great way to pay tribute to him by releasing it to as many screens as they can. At least I really hope they do. If you can't go to see it. I'd say it's worth renting anyway.",positive

And So It Goes,". . . from one of the most frenetic birthing scenes since GONE WITH THE WIND to graphic footage of butterfly reproduction. AND SO IT GOES from the dope house to the prison cell, featuring characters who have real life jobs and problems. Since the action is set and filmed in Connecticut, there are none of those ubiquitous palm trees that mar so many Hollywood pictures shot in California and other Southern states. When things look bleakest in this tale, baseball comes to the rescue. Violence and animal abuse are kept to a minimum, as the main action sequence involves an ""Oopsie!"" on a slip-and-slide. AND SO IT GOES from second chances to third or fourth tries, with every well-developed character serving a purpose. Aging actress Diane Keaton gets to laugh, cry, and croon about a dozen Golden Oldies, while the geriatric Michael Douglas proves he's still fit enough to carry a skinny 10-year-old girl at least 12 feet. AND SO IT GOES.",negative
And So It Goes,"If you were told to watch a movie directed by Rob Reiner, starring Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton, with a budget of $30 mil. you could think that you are about to experience a movie with powerful emotions and an interesting plot.Actually, in the end, this is a rather simple movie and its course is obvious from the beginning.Michael Douglas plays Oren Little, a realtor who's about to retire after he makes his last sale, and Diane Keaton plays his singer next-door neighbor. What will happen between them is to be seen (I won't spoil it for you) but I'm pretty sure you have already guessed.The acting from the 2 veteran actors is effortless but the direction from the once-mighty Rob Reiner is too simple and targeting more for a few easy laughs if nothing else. Note that Reiner is also in the movie as the pianist who plays for Diane Keaton's character.It's a dramedy more than just a comedy but even the dramatic elements are more likely to promote laughter, if not anything else.There a couple of good songs sang by Keaton (?) and you also get to see Grease's Frankie Valli in a cameo appearance.Overall: It's OK. Douglas/Keaton are fun to watch, but don't expect greatness.",positive

The best movie in that genre still remains Braindead, and of course the Evil Dead movies, but this one I will remember as well. The exaggeration in the gory details is what makes it funny. The amount of slashed body parts and the inventive ways they use to do it is just hilarious. The script might not be the best ever but that's not what it is about with a movie like Deathgasm. It's just a bit fun. Fun for people like me that get that kind of humor. Some others will probably hate that movie and that's okay.

12 Feet Deep,"A ok movie with a low budget shot with in 14 days totally deserve a watch with the budget, you should accept what u will get.

You get drama and thriller moments. But didnt feel the characters much and didnt feel much thriller. 6/10‚≠ê",negative
12 Feet Deep,"""12 Feet Deep: Two Sisters Trapped"" displays an emotional depth and creativity rarely seen in a film. Much like the old saying, ""he has more talent in his little finger than you do in your whole body"", Matt Eskandari does more within the confines of a single olympic sized swimming pool than most writer/directors can achieve crossing oceans. Both physically and existentially trapped, the two sisters are seemingly drawn into this nightmare by cosmic forces--made to endure this hardship together to work out their demons.And just when you're settling in to the Sorkin-esque dialogue, the natural back and forth that turns into haunting soliloquy at the drop of a hat, a third character is introduced.SPOILERS AHEADThe girls finally think they've found their saving grace when the janitor--Clara--enters the pool to clean. However, soon enough the pair realize that the down on her luck janitor isn't so keen to see them freed before getting something out of the deal. The last 40 minutes are a taut and masterfully woven journey wherein the downtrodden Clara grapples with the unfairness of the world while delivering some unfairness of her own. The three tussle back and forth before a crisis of conscious urges Clara to free them--only for her to find that she cannot draw back the pool cover and rescue the girls.
I won't say any more, because I would not want to deprive the audience of what some may soon consider the most edge-of-your-seat, nail-biting, anxiety inducing ends to a movie in some time. As my friend and I watched the final twenty minutes of the film, we both rejoiced and cursed ""ESKANDARI"" for the way he played with our emotions in those final moments.Sorkin meets Kubrick meets Spielberg meets Perry. Someday Eskandari will be a household name that other viewers will curse and praise in equal measure. All I can say for now is, I'll have trouble sleeping tonight pondering the bigger question of 12 Feet Deep, and coming down from the exhilaration I felt watching this movie.",positive
Batman Ninja,"The art style pays homage to traditional painters like Hokusai and kayosai. Japanese print art and caligraphy are used to get effect to make this one of the best looking Batman animated films released in the last decade. Batmans costumes alone are superb from his great blue glowing tech suit in the beginning to the ninja clothing at the end. Joker too gets a lavish makeover that'll make toy companies stress for ages trying to replicate.
Unfortunately the plot goes from the implausible time travel plot (but ok I'll go with it) to out right bat crap insane in the last 20 minutes or so. It seems to want to do a bit for every kind of fan of japanese anime. One minute it's a stunning ninja scroll style martial arts romp, next it's a transformers/gundam style robot slugfest. 
I honestly started laughing loudly when the army of monkeys (yes you read that right) all join together to make one big giant armoured monkey (yet again you are reading this correctly) to fight a huge mecha robot made up of the top 5 batman villains houses (seriously... it's their homes!).
I was laughing really hard but nothing would prepare me for what happened next! As the giant armoured monkey began to lose to the giant house monster a swarm of bats surrounded the mecha money and turned it into a colossal batman called ""bat god"".
It was at this point I yelled ""oh jesus god no!"" And damn near wet my trousers laughing so hard. I don't think that was supposed to be the desired effect.
I suspect it will work well for a bunch of drunk guys looking for a movie to lampoon and laugh at like Tommy Wiseau's The Room or Samurai Cop. The dialogue feels hokey in places but this could be due to having to translate directly from japanese but sometimes it's too on the nose. Again it looks fantastic but a change in art style right in the middle really jars. After a huge battle between joker and batman on a boat, red hood is strolling along a country footpath and comes across a man and his wife farming. He then accuses the man of being the joker and begins to beat him. Batman appears from nowhere and stops him saying that the farmer used to be the joker but he isn't anymore and they should leave the old farmer/former joker alone. There is no explanation as to what the time frame is from the last scene to this scene is and almost feels like it doesn't belong or they tacked it on realising there was a gaping plothole as to why joker randomly goes missing for a while and then shows up at the end just to fight batman. There is fun to be had with this film and again it looks so great but it throws almost every kind of japanese anime into the mix and really pushes the envelope of a realistic setting. This wouldn't too much of a problem but there feels like two conflicting styles of storytelling happening, one based around batman being stripped of all his tech to find out what he is without it, ala Iron Man 3 and rhe other has giant monkey monsters, submarines, huge mounted gatling guns, spiritually aware bats, hive minded monkeys and fighting houses. Altogether it leaves for a ""what the hell was that feeling"" and finally ends with Batman returning to Gotham, alfred using a horse drawn batmobile garnished in feudal japanese decor being driven through the streets of gotham with bruce being clearly visible just sitting there! So now anyone that sees the horse drawn batmobile going through the streets can clearly see bruce wayne and now know who Batman is WTF?!
Some things you can put to artistic interpretation but that is just absolutely and fundamentally not Batman. 
Just buy a poster and imagine what the film it could have been.",negative
Batman Ninja,"The main problem with ""Batman Ninja"" is the advertising. Make no mistake, this is a kids film, and had the trailers offered glimpses of its *ahem* wackier moments, serious Batfans would have known to leave well alone. By the end, ""Batman Ninja"" closer resembles the Power Rangers than Batman.I will start with ""Batman Ninja""s sole positive: its subtle combination of hand-drawn anime comic and 3D art styles is gorgeous. I'd go as far as saying this is the most painstakingly beautiful DC animation I've seen.The voice acting is fine, with exception to the worst casting misstep of the Joker since Suicide Squad. The actor Tony Hale portrays him with an irritating manic energy that somehow makes Harley Quinn seem restrained. This was the first indication to me that Batman Ninja would be little more than Saturday morning cartoon fare.The dialogue and characterisations are surprisingly poor throughout. My biggest reservation of cross-pollinating Western and Eastern stories is the lack of true understanding from either side. And so it is in this case. Batman is a fool, unworthy of his reputation as a world-class detective. The Joker is an annoying court jester with none of the more subversive qualities we have come to expect. Catwoman is usually consistent with previous incarnations, but written without depth (as are the other supporting characters).The idea of Batman's technology being stripped from him, forcing him to adapt to his new (or rather, old) environment, is genuinely fascinating. But any fan will tell you that technology does not define the Batman, but rather allow him to operate on a larger scale. Seeing him suffer a mini personality crisis following the destruction of his toys was odd, to say the least.Finally, ""Batman Ninja"" reintroduces the cheesy kitsch of a bygone era, which Warner Bros should know by now is a mistake (Schumacher). The Batman 60s theme tune even plays at one point, just in case it was all too subtle.Warner's animation department is pretty much the only thing they have going for them as far as DC are concerned, but Batman Ninja is a big backwards step, and a wasted opportunity. A one-shot story with a Batman born and raised in feudal, corrupt Tokugawa Japan could have been truly special.",positive
A Field in England,"After three remarkable contemporary black comedies Ben Wheatley has now all but reinvented the British historical picture with ""A Field in England"". Set during the English Civil War and filmed in black and white this is as far removed from the likes of ""Cromwell"" or such stately Oscar-grabbers as ""A Man for all Seasons"" or ""Anne of the 1000 Days"" as it's possible to get. But then nothing Wheatley has done to date has been conventional.In ""Down Terrace"" an average British family of petty criminals set about slaughtering each other. In ""Kill List"", two hit-men find themselves in 'Wicker Man' territory while in ""Sightseers"" a Mike Leighish couple on a camping holiday turn into Bonnie and Clyde. Consequently, ""A Field in England"" turns out to be, not so much a film about the Civil War at all, but another variation on Wheately's theme of subverting genre norms.The deserters who find themselves traversing not one but many fields in England are even from the same side but are simply thrown together after a battle while what happens to them bears no resemblance to what happens to 'soldiers', (I use the term loosely), in other pictures. This is quirky, original and quite unlike anything else. It certainly won't be to everyone's taste, particularly if you like your narratives straightforward but it confirms Wheatley as one of the most innovative directors working in cinema today.",negative
A Field in England,"This came with a fair bit of hype being directed by Ben Wheatley who made KILL LIST that gained a cult following and due to being released on multiple platforms ie released at selected cinemas , Blue-ray , DVD and broadcast on Film4 all on the same day . With hindsight the people who didn't pay to watch this film are luckier than the ones who did and anyone who hasn't seen this pretentious pile of horse manure is luckier than anyone who has Critics who saw preview copies of FIELD were very vague about the plot . That is because the film has no plot . Some deserters from the English Civil War team up , walk through some fields , take magic mushrooms and shoot each other . Anyone expecting something along the lines of WITCHFINDER GENERAL will be disappointed because this is like a bad episode of Monty Python without the surreal jokes crossed with Tarkovsky It's a case of style over substance , not so much substance abuse but plenty of style abuse . Wheatley realises there's no story to the screenplay so wastes his celluloid and the audiences time by showing off every directorial technique he learned at film school . If he's trying to emulate the brooding atmosphere of Nicolas Winding Refn's VALHALLA RISING then he's failed because this is Valhalla sinking . Sinking in to a big cesspit filled with pretentious poo The critics who did see it before the general public did lavish praise upon it and is a classic example that the emperor is naked . It is a film of incomprehensible storytelling that has no plot and makes very little sense . If it was made by a bunch of film students it wouldn't receive a distributor and the only reason it received any type of publicity is because it was directed by the fashionable and overrated Ben Wheatley and the multi platform release .

The Two Faces of January,"'The to faces of January' is an old-fashioned, decent thriller with a nice sixties setting and solid acting. Everything about it is immaculate. The plot is intelligent enough: a couple of rich tourists meet a young American tour guide, who accidentally witnesses the husband committing a crime. One thing leads to another, and soon enough the guide is caught in a web of lies and deceit, and it becomes impossible to escape without incriminating himself. The crime story is spiced up by the mutual romantic attraction between the guide and the young wife. There is even a sort of life lesson included: money is the root of all evil. The movie is well worth seeing, if only because it is nice to see a film that's not experimental, violent, provocative, filled with special effects or in one way or another trying to be hip or trendy. I can see why so many reviewers make references to Hitchcock. The film is set in the early sixties, the era in which Hitch made some of his best films like 'The Birds' or 'Marnie'. Still, this film lacks the touch of a genius like Hitchcock. The characters have no extra psychological layers, and the unconventional scenes and themes that make the Hitchcock-movies so special, are absent in this film.",negative
The Two Faces of January,"If this movie had been made back in mid-century when Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Donen and Billy Wilder were at their peak, it probably wouldn't get much attention.

It doesn't promise a lot: there are no special effects, the plot twists aren't terribly surprising; in fact, nothing in the movie really surprises. But it's all so seamlessly put together, so pleasingly directed, and shot with such loving attention to the scenery, Two Faces is a real delight. Don't come with great expectations--come simply for the pure entertainment of what a movie can be when everything in it works well.

Elvis & Nixon,Casting in a movie like this is supremely important because the content is not favorable or intriguing and as a matter of fact bizarre.It only holds value in that its a true story with two famous people involved.Shannon does a terrible job attempting and failing to portray Elvis as he might have been at the time. His moves facially and bodily are not consistent with Elvis moves. His speech mannerisms suffer greatly as well.Shannon is a very good actor but he should have not taken the part.Did he ever see Elvis in any of his portrayals?Elvis at 35 years old he was an extremely handsome and a vibrant person.Shannon looks lots older and could not begin to look like Elvis.Take a look at the 68 comeback special to see what he looked like then check out Shannon and his looks.Sorry ...we are Elvis fans forever and this portrayal was horrible.Spacey as Nixon was also poor.Its not his fault. He captured verylittle of what Nixon looked or sounded like.With Shannon its the same but of the two Spacey was better.We gave them all the benefit of the doubt but the next day we felt themovie is very flawed.Its a shame that we as fans lost the opportunity to enjoy a performance that would have more celebrated Elvis Life instead of demeaning it.,negative
Elvis & Nixon,"I really hadn't heard much about this film, and certainly wasn't going in expecting an Elvis impersonator or someone looking exactly like President Nixon. Wasn't disappointed there in regard to Elvis. Michael Shannon didn't look much like Elvis, but he did have the soft voice, the southern charm thing going for him. He did a fine job with this role. And actually, Kevin Spacey did manage to look a great deal like Nixon. Sounded like him, too. Everyone in this movie did a good job, and worked the roles of those involved in this slightly absurd moment in history to justice. So, I guess what I was, was really pleasantly surprised by this picture. Totally enjoyed myself with lots of laughs and a few poignant moments. I dimly remember this episode with Elvis showing up at the White House wanting to become an FBI Agent Abroad. With a badge. And at the time I recall thinking that only Elvis could be that na√Øve and yet that brash at the same time. In all honesty, this picture managed to show all of that, and more.

Many of the campers didn't have a chance of seeing who the shooter was, and if they did they were most likely doomed. It makes the situation extremely scary, as there is no visible presentation of the threat. Just shots firing from a gun, with one person after the other getting hit...I'm sorry, I'm getting too emotional. But it's really hard not to. I felt all the fear, all the dirt and sand and the uncertainty over whether someone was going to make it out alive or not. The fact that it's impossible to know the fate of any of the victims beforehand is particularly horrifying. There are no easy hiding places, not a spot where you can feel completely safe and sound.It feels weird to point out the acting in a way, since never at any point in the movie did I notice I was watching people acting. But I still have to give props to the especially brilliant performance of Andrea Berntzen as Kaja. Even though her mission to find her sister is extremely dangerous, you understand it from her angle why she would do it. You can sense every heartbeat and emotion that she goes through as she finds herself witnessing things that once you've seen it, it's stuck in your mind forever.I was bawling my eyes red at the end of it. It's unbelievable that such a tragedy struck a country like Norway, at a nice and homely island, the place where you would least expect something like this to ever occur.Yes, it's ""just"" a movie. But this is the closest you will possibly come to experiencing a tragedy at an isolated resort. As horrible as watching it play out in great detail was, be as grateful as you can it never happened to you. And to all the brave people who survived, stay strong and live your lives as happily as you can.",positive
[REC] 4: Apocalypse,"I have never really loved mainstream Hollywood horror movies, and REC's first installment is one of my favorites. While the first film (c. 2007) of the franchise is arguably the best, there is a real debate about the third one, which talks altogether about something else. But, in here, the director-actress duo have successfully closed a good franchise by continuing stories from the second and third films.We are now in a quarantined ship where doctors are researching on a serum that will serve as an antidote to the parasite and its bacteria. Our reporter friend, two Military soldiers, doctors, and the ship's crew fret it out in a ""survival of the fittest"" kinda situation as the subject of the research runs amok. As a zombie apocalypse ensues, alas! without the found footage element, but with security surveillance element, we find out that the truth is not what it seemed to be. And there is more to what happened at the end of installment two.Although the film starts pretty slowly, it becomes spot on after thirty or so minutes. Lots of unwanted blood baths and absurd dialogs may keep you from continuing, but if you are brave enough and forgo these horror film requisites, REC 4 will turn out to be real entertainment. The dark setting helps as the franchise probably ends here.BOTTOM LINE: If you have been following the franchise, this will make an amazing watch with friends and family. Happy New Year 2015!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOFore/Violence: Infinity",negative
[REC] 4: Apocalypse,"Looking forward to see REC 4 ones it was over I was left with mixed emotions. The unique story of REC was gone. By now you do know how the zombies or infected do look and move and the surprises seen in part 1 and 2 are gone. It's of course normal that by part 4 you have seen it all before but even as it has a few intense moments it's the use of lighting and the shots that made it hard to sit through.It starts off rather well because we go back to the apartment were √Ångela Vidal (Manuela Velasco) was taken by the infested and disappeared at the end of part 1. They do rescue her not without a few attacks by the way. She's been taken to a cargo on the ocean were they are doing experiments on her and the soldiers who has taken her out of the apartment. It's even funny when suddenly an old lady comes across the story who is asking were the honeymoon takes place, a wink to REC 2. But by then the story weakens a bit because once you see the lab you know what is going to happen. When an experiment goes wrong an infected monkey breaks out of it's cage and spreads the disease. But what could have been a surprising reprise turned into an annoying experience. Lights do flash a lot and the camera moves a lot and is zoomed in for most of the time so it's a on and off of seeing what is going on. The reason is rather simple, the surprise of REC couldn't be done again. It even reminded me a lot of Alien (1979) because Angela becomes the hero and walks around in her undershirt a lot so Ripley isn't that far away. There's a bit of explanation what makes the virus and the end is open so it's off to REC 5 I guess. But I hope that the suspense and the creepy look of the infected like in REC is back there. Don't get me wrong. It isn't that bad after all but due the use of zoomed in shaky camera shots it didn't infected me .Gore 2/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",positive
The Numbers Station,"About 15 - 20 minutes in, I was very close to giving up on this. I'm glad I didn't. It's no masterpiece, but what you'll get is a very authentic, at times claustrophobic and thoroughly convincing thriller.This is a *british* production, and it shows. There are very few Hollywood stereotypes here, just a believable story that avoids most of the action blockbuster clich√©s and that actually manages to keep you on the edge of your seat as soon as the ""situation"" starts. There's an obvious reason why it seems a bit slow in the beginning, and the impact is all the more effective when it hits.I was slightly worried that Cusack might be miscast in this (that happens frequently with him, I find), but he's actually quite convincing as the suddenly conscience-ridden sociopath assassin he plays.All in all I'm pretty sure this will be both too low-key and a bit slow in the build-up for younger audiences, but it's certainly one of the more intense thrillers I've seen in a while. Mostly, I realize now, because they manage through a thorough build-up, an authentic frame and good acting to actually make me care about what happens to the lead characters. And that's increasingly rare in movies these days, I think.",negative
The Numbers Station,"I saw that this movie only scored 5.4 on IMDb and I wanted to quickly write that it's a whole lot better than that. The movie kept me interested from start to finish. It doesn't slow down appreciably at any point. There isn't an overwhelming amount of action but there is a tense atmosphere throughout. The location is also great. A moody, grey numbers station right out in the middle of nowhere. But the main reason for watching this movie is Cusack who perfectly plays the loner, haunted, tough guy, with a conscience. He's supremely watchable in every frame. In fact, Cusack plays these types of characters better than anything else. He has that suitably detached, dangerous look, down to a tee. He also does ambiguity very well. All of this is displayed really well in the movie. Ackerman is also well cast as the enthusiastic, smart code girl.",positive
Grand Piano,"I love movies about music. Dreyfuss in The Competition, now that's a good movie. I saw a Late Quartet, and they did the best they could with non musicians. In this debacle I was ready to hit the stop button within minutes. When you shoot a movie about cops, you hire a cop as a consultant. That guy tells you that the holster goes around your waist, and not around your head. Medical shows hire doctors and nurses, military shows hire ex-military. This debacle must have hired a doctor, nurse, cop or ex-military to consult on the musical accuracy as they could have not gotten it more wrong.First off, it's a frickin pianist, not a piano player, trained classical musicians don't refer to themselves as piano players. Second, you need only goto youtube to figure out where the piano goes when performing with an orchestra. Its not on a stage behind, its right next to the conductor. If you were making a movie about baseball would you put the catcher in the outfield??? c'mon frigging do some homework before you make a film about music.As far as the rest of it, after he got up during the performance and left the stage the movie lost the sliver of credibility it had left.If you want to suspend disbelief, combine this with Gravity and have the jerk off pianist playing in outer space while George Clooney conducts.Just because the average person doesn't know what is correct doesn't give the film maker license to spit in the face of the musical world.",negative
Grand Piano,"Really good movie, it deserves a better rating than a 6, my ten is to bump it up. From a literal frame of reference, some of it is unbelievable, like how he is talking and texting while playing the most difficult piano piece in the world....but I think people are missing the real beauty of this piece (movie). The movie itself is like a piece of music, rising and falling with a continual rise to the crescendo. All of this action and suspense/tension could very well have been taking place in the mind of the main character. You sense from the very start how neurotic and anxious he is about his career and his screw-ups. The way the movie unfolds make you feel like you are inside the mind of the pianist as he is playing the most difficult piece of music in the world. So the director NAILED it, if that was his intent. People don't see the underlying meaning to things, or how art can be a metaphor, for the human mind. Finally, throughout the starting about 5 people tell him to BREAK A LEG...haha. When he ends up falling and actually breaking his leg, I had totally forgot about that buildup, and it was genuinely GENIUS. A perfect ending to this intelligent thriller.",positive
Batman and Harley Quinn,"I paid twenty bucks to see this movie in the cinema. Twenty bucks to watch Harley Quinn farting in the Batmobile and Batman telling Nightwing it ""smells like discipline."" I'm serious. The movie was bad enough before that with Harley complaining about being treated like a sex object only to then have her way with Nightwing tied to her bed, but the fart scene was as much as I could take. Yes, I endured the rest of this in order to review it but nothing could save it by then. Poor writing, too many convenient plot devices and a really lazy ending. Plus a post-credit sequence that went for 3.5 minutes and had zero relevance to the actual plot of the movie! I really hope this isn't the direction the DC animated universe is heading, because if that's the case I'm done with it.",negative
Batman and Harley Quinn,"I don't understand the low rating?Batman and Harley Quinn was fun, sexy, and very entertaining to watch. I really liked Melissa Rauch as Harley Quinn, and I really like it when she tied up Nightwing and seduces him. The story and plot are easy to follow along. Harley working alongside Batman and Nightwing is a great touch, and I wonder if Nightwing and Harley will continue to be friends with benefits as long as she stays on her meds? It seems Batman just doesn't trust or thinks Harley is sane enough to make it a permanent relationship. I don't really know what's going to happen, I'm new to the Batman DVD's and haven't really been interested in them until lately.",positive
In a World...,"'IN A WORLD': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Actress Lake Bell makes her feature film directorial and writing debut with this indie comedy about a woman struggling to compete in the male dominated movie trailer voice-over world. The title refers to one of the most common trailer voice-over lines in film history (made famous by legendary voice actor Donald LaFontaine). The movie also revolves around the desire of the competing voice-over actors to take over that line (and landing one trailer that would allow them to do so). The film co-stars Rob Corddry, Demetri Martin, Ken Marino, Michaela Watkins, Fred Melamed and Nick Offerman. It's an impressive performance by Bell on all fronts! Bell stars as Carol, a vocal coach who stumbles upon a big break in to the movie voice-over acting world. Her father, Sam Soto (Melamed). is a veteran in the business who's now retiring. When a popular book series is going to be turned into a probable blockbuster film franchise the first film trailer is heavily sought after, especially because it will bring back the popular trailer line 'In a world'. Soto wants his friend, and likely successor, Gustav Warner (Marino) to land the gig but when Gustav gets laryngitis Carol is asked to record a temp track instead. Her recording is so good that the producers want her for the trailer instead and a heated competition begins.The movie is funny and touching in just the right places. All of the characters are written and acted well and I didn't even get into the plot line involving Carol's sister and her husband (Watkins and Corddry). They're part of the movie was actually the most touching to me but the main storyline is an interesting and entertaining subject for a movie (and one that hasn't been used much before, that I've seen). Bell show a lot of talent not just as an actress but as a writer and director as well (now). Certainly she's not just another pretty face!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UY2UtXfI_w",negative
In a World...,"A friend invited me to a Sundance USA event in San Francisco, where they take 10 films from the festival and show them in different cities around the US. I had no idea what the movie was even about, and obviously no expectations.I was completely blown away. 'In a World' was one of the funniest, cleverly-written and flawlessly edited movies I've seen this year (2012-present). From Demetri Martin, Rob Cordry and Lake Bell herself, the acting was fantastic. I had seen Lake Bell in 'How to Make it in America' and thought she was great, but I had no idea how unbelievably talented she is (i.e. playing an accent- obsessed speech coach/aspiring voice-over actress who does probably 10+ flawless accents throughout the movie...a movie she wrote and directed as well. No big deal).I'm not sure if this movie is getting distributed to a wider audience, but I'm grateful my friend convinced me to go. If you have a chance to catch this, it's a must-see.",positive
American Heist,"I usually don't review movies but I decided to on this one because it was especially bad. Pretty much the entire movie is about two brothers complaining and cussing at each other about why their lives are screwed up. There is nothing American about the mediocre ""heist"" which seems more like a subplot than the whole point of the movie. In fact, the heist doesn't even occur until near the end of the movie. As for the heist itself I don't think it could have been more pathetic. A bunch of thugs walked into the bank killed the manager, and got some cash then were killed by cops. At the end of the movie there are still a lot of loose ends even though I didn't care anyway. Overall it was an awful movie and I wish I could get a refund for my time.",negative
American Heist,After watching I checked the reviews and was quite surprised that they are all pretty negative. The acting of both brothers was very convincing and touched me a lot. I didn't get bored at all but wanted to see what happens next. There were by far enough action scenes. It made the movie look real rather than stupid. I'm not a fan of ridiculous action scenes every five minutes - So this was just fine for me. It's mainly about the relationship and history of the two brothers and was described good enough to understand. I'm a big fan of Adrien Brody and thought his performance was excellent. People should at least give the movie a try and I'm sure lots won't be disappointed. Maybe the title wasn't the right choice but all in all this was an entertaining and cool movie with a surprising end.,positive
Barefoot,"so this is actually the second time i watch something for Scott Speedman, the first time i'v watched him was in the Underworld movies when he was serious guy vampire /wolf .. but he really fits in these kinda romance-comedy movies ,, the movie had its moments , some highs and lows ,, the plot is good and new and heartwarming. the script is written in a good way , no complications on following the events. you know when you watch a movie and you feel happy , smiling in a weird way in the end , yeah .. that's one of those. The story itself starts slow and there is some missing ideas and it's not that Hilarious ,, but it still felt nice . the casting was so good. so i think overall the movie worked out pretty well.",negative
Barefoot,"Jay Wheeler (Scott Speedman) lives up to his name as a wheeler-dealer. A son of wealthy New Orleans stock, he has chosen to run up gambling debts and pursue other nefarious actions. This lands him in jail, where he is sentenced to community service at a mental hospital. While mopping the floors, he saves a pretty patient, Daisy (Evan Rachel Wood) from being assaulted by a male resident of the same ward. Not long after this, his gambling totals are so large that the casinos are after him. His only recourse is to go back home for his brother's wedding, where he will ask his father for a ""business loan"". But, needing to look the part of a successful gentleman, Jay decides he needs a lady on his arm. All of the pole dancers of his acquaintance turn him down so he gets the brilliant idea to bring DAISY, after she follows him out the door one night. Is he serious? Yes, she's highly functional but may have killed her mother, also a disturbed individual. With instructions to tell everyone she is a nurse, can Daisy and Jay pull this ruse off? Not likely, and soon other escapades follow. Meanwhile, the hospital's head shrink (JK Simmons) is throwing fit after fit. Is there a future for this strange couple? This remake of a German film has a great concept and a winning performance from Wood to elevate its eventual loss of energy. What fun to have a ""crazy"" woman pose as a gal pal at a high society wedding! Speedman does fine work, too, as do Treat Williams, Simmons, Kate Burton and more. As the scenery goes from California to Louisiana to Texas and back again, fans of varied venues will be happy, too. Yes, the flick slows down and loses focus in the second half but still will resonate with a certain kind of offbeat film lover. So, if that's you, get shoes on and go get Barefoot.",positive
My Life as a Zucchini,"Whenever I review a Stop-motion animated film, I always start with by saying it is a dying art form that needs a bigger lift from us. It gave a new life for filmmaking when there were no technology like computers hundred years ago for the creation of giant creatures to all the fantasy and magical world. I am glad that every year someone coming forward to show the world how beautiful these are.I think there's a quota for it and 2D animation for the Oscars. Otherwise, these formats would die sooner than we expected, so that recognition in the big stage. Every year at least one film from these two categories makes out. This year it was a double jackpot for Stop-motion animation. Including this, 'Kubo and the Two Strings' was the other one to shine in the world's biggest film awards ceremony. But winning the trophy is almost impossible in this 3D animated film world. Anyway, I'm happy for this, that I enjoyed watching it.It was a short film, that ran for just one hour. First, we have to understand filmmaking in this form is a most challenging one than any other. It is a manual work. I mean people get in there and frame by frame do all the work. So for this one hour film, they had done the great hard work and it paid off well by got nominated for the Oscars. It was also Switzerland's official submission for the Best Foreign Language Film, but failed to make progress in that race.The screenplay was based on the book. A simple story with a strong message. This is the tale of a boy with full of dreams and after his alcoholic mother died, he is taken to the orphanage. That is the last place he wanted to be where he meets a mean boy and soon becomes his close friend. Being young kids, they tend to play some pranks with officials, visitors and themselves. That's one of the ways to cope with for where they have ended. So the remaining is to tell us would they get a second chance in their lives.‚ùùI don't know why I'm crying. Sometimes people cry because they're happy.‚ùûWhen some take up a project like this, they are not offered to make mistakes in choosing a weak screenplay. Because there are thousands of films in production around the world and in those, a handful of animated films, but probably he's only one up for a Stop-motion animated feature. Which means everyone with the knowledge of his commitment will be looking forward to it. So the filmmakers have opted to adapt a novel, which is always a best option in filmmaking.The next is the characters. Making them come alive, particularly initial stage, the creation of models. Yep, they have done that job as well so well. Gooding looking ones, especially among the kids for having similarity with their vision. The frame rate was good. Very smoother for viewing. So technically it was a flawless for the normal watch. An impressive storyline, which might serve as a tearjerker for a few.There's a little romance, but from the children's perspective of having a crush. Since the girl character was introduced, the narration takes a fresh look. The following event becomes even more adventurous and fun filled till the end. The voice-over was excellent. From the dialogues to the film scenes very impressive. It marks the directional debut for a short filmmaker. An appreciable work and I hope he makes more like them with new technics than migrating to computer animations.One of the advantages is it is a short and sweet film, but those who love such films might feel it is too short. Most importantly, there're not clich√©s like what we've seen films that takes place in the orphanages. The opening was shocking. If it was a real life, the boy would have ended in a different place. Still the emotional parts were less explored, yet very convincing for not leaning too much on that facet.The film is one of the best in its kind, but I agree it's not a masterpiece. Not if you have seen plenty of Stop-motion animations in your life. Yet it can't be neglected that easily and surely it is for everyone. I know there are folks who thinks this format of films are for little ones, but the truth is they are still in the pre 90s mindset. This is good, give it a try and you might love it. Anyway, for its rareness itself highly recommended, then you decided how do you liked it or not.7/10",negative
My Life as a Zucchini,"It's easy to dismiss an animated film like this that deals with the themes that this does. The film's quality, however, goes a long way towards making us realize that running time doesn't dictate how good something is. This film is short, but it packs a punch. One of its biggest strengths is that it doesn't try to fill up the running time or try to do many other turns in the storyline. It's very, very simply but as a result its themes are clearer than many other animated films' themes. It's handled with delicacy and subtlety. It's an incredibly strong film that I recommend.",positive
Honeymoon,"Do not judge this film on its first 15 minutes. Let it simmer.Excellently crafted thriller-turned-horror. This film doesn't simply ""keep you guessing,"" it compels your interest in the answers. The seemingly superfluous dialogue (e.g., the duck story, the misused words) all pay off.",negative
Honeymoon,"I've never really experienced sitting through a film after figuring out the 'twist' LLOONNGG before our central character has. Pretty boring, isn't it? And, as our intrepid 'hero' finds mounting evidence that the girl he just married is not the person she once was after a little naked sleepwalk before dawn, I found myself utterly indifferent to their fates. The plot moves as if it was stuck in quick drying cement, and having already worked out most of the final details as to what was going on, there was little else worth watching. Beside the general wackiness.She suddenly can't remember important information, like their first date. Her personality has undergone a complete 180 degree shift, for instance now she enjoys jumping in cold water when the night before she HATED it. And there are those mysterious marks appearing all over her... Insect bites, she says. HA!! The clincher is when she begins to give birth to what looks like giant sea slugs. And I am happy to report: Mother and gross slimy molluscs are doing just fine. WELL THAT'S A RELIEF, THEN!!If you see an intense light shining on a person in a movie when they're asleep after dark in bed, I immediately assume ALIENS. Was I right? 10 points to me! There was one thing I was misled on though... after seeing an inordinate amount of what resembled frogspawn around, I jumped to the conclusion that the female had become a clone a'la Invasion Of The Body Snatchers. Turned out the explanation is even more stupid than that... This lady is being transformed from inside, and soon she'll be departing Mother Earth against her will with the extraterrestrial lifeforms.Not to worry... She was kind enough to spend a few more days on our soil with her partner before shuffling off in a spaceship. Except... It ISN'T her... heck, I saw that about 48 hours before the supposed 'love of her life' did. It would been kinder for her to just be taken up to the stars straightaway... Perhaps leaving a note behind for her ex, with a little white lie attached so he could get over her in time. But, no... instead she frustrates him with her bizarre behaviour for the duration they're still together... And later even KILLS the poor dude accidentally when she tries to hide him underwater from those nasty aliens. Yes, she's so out of it she forgot he only had lungs.None of this makes a lick o'sense, and could only be described as a drug influenced dream. Which is what everyone involved in this junk must have been on when they agreed to participate in it. Can I have some, please?

We Are Still Here,"I had high hopes for this one, especially after seeing where it was heading. Don't ask my why, cause there have been so many such productions, and still, somehow, I hoped for the best.OK, let us begin: the movie is not bad, it has some good jump scares, OK effects, decent plot tho ever used, good actors and a cold chill surrounding. So, why does it fail? I'll tell you: the plot brings nothing new, the ending is as predictable as it gets and it acts exactly like so many before it. OK, maybe the production is better, maybe the budget was bigger and used for the best, still, the story behind it all, has nothing new to offer, just that tired old formula.Once you see it, you'll understand. At points it even makes little sense. But more deaths had to occur therefore logic had to make a run for it. Overall, a 5, maybe even a solid 5 but nothing more.Cheers!",negative
We Are Still Here,"I was lucky enough to see this at a friends house last night, went into it blind, and oh boy what a nice surprise.Whilst yes, it's another haunted house movie, this brings something new to the table with a great climax to the film that really ramps it up.The performances from the whole cast are excellent,and the main four characters are likable and believable.The cinematography is excellent, and the whole film just has this authentic feel to it.I won't reveal anything of the storyline,as I think it's one of those films that's best enjoyed if you don't know too much about it,but as a seasoned horror fan,I found this one of the most refreshing films I've seen in years with some good tension and scares.I've seen some comments about 'B movie this, B movie that', but I didn't get that feeling at all, this had the feel of a 70's-80's classic horror.A little more character development of the villains would have made this even better, it could have stood another 10 minutes or more being added to the running time which would have allowed this.I'll be pre-ordering the Blu Ray as soon as possible,when there are so many horror films out there that shouldn't have even been released, this deserves my money and to be in my collection.",positive

The Program,"My review is very much written from the point of view of a cycling fan and rider who has followed the story for nearly 2 decades. I have to declare that I have a more sympathetic and favourable view of Lance Armstrong and Michele Ferrari than others.Overall, The Program is a flawed and poorly researched biopic full of inaccuracies and misconceptions. The movie tries to cram a lot of events over 13 years in without presenting it in a clear and coherent way for the audience. The film is almost wholly one sided and does not tell the whole story. Its protagonist, David Walsh is portrayed as an innocent journalist who walked into the evidence rather than someone who spent a decade trying to destroy Armstrong and cycling through methods not too dissimilar to its key antagonist. The story does not tell of how Walsh harassed, pushed and entrapped some of the witnesses including the Andreus into a corner and force them to come out against Lance and their friends against their will. It also glorifies irresponsible journalism, Walsh wrote the damning LA Confidentiel without hard evidence and purely basing on his gut, accounts from his sources and inadmissible evidence. The fact that he turned out to be largely right does not make him a hero or what he did to be right and the film does not reflect that in anyway. I won't go into the Armstrong story in too much detail except to say that Lance was portrayed as the doper and at times the only one driving the doping. The fact is everyone of his rivals doped and he was as much of a product of his time and situation than anything else.The science and history behind the story was so lazy and badly researched it was laughable. If VO2max is the only determinant of performance, why do we bother having the races and wouldn't young Oskar Svendsen be the most successful rider ever? Then the film celebrates the fact that Walsh predicted he would be a great one day rider and he couldn't win races in Europe...when the truth was Armstrong at the time when he first met Walsh was already world champion, the most prestigious one day race in the world and had won it in Oslo before his 22nd birthday.Finally, it is a real shame the way Michele Ferrari was portrayed...in essence like a shady drug pusher with a French accent. Canet looks like a villain from the 60s Batman than a middle aged Italian physician. The real world truth is that Michele Ferrari is the most brilliant sports physician of his time, his methods may or may not have been ethical but his aim was like many human scientists to push boundary of our race and in the spirit of how we evolved through the ages. Check out his articles on 53x12.com, even the public research and knowledge and new ground is so inspirational and insightful it is quite amazing.The truth is I see The Program as a fable on modern media, where it has the power to build you up and then tear you down if it sells. Cycling has paid for its sins many times over but it is by no means the dirtiest sport, the standards of testing and controls even back in the really dark ages of the 80s and 90s is so much ahead of other sports like NFL, soccer, athletics, tennis etc. I will always love the sport of cycling both as a fan and as a rider, it enriches so many people's lives that I really hate people who tries to destroy it, especially to create headlines and sell newspapers/books.",negative
The Program,"But I must confess to not being a supremely dedicated cycling fan and wasn't aware of the details of Armstrong's case prior to watching this so part of my entertainment was fuelled by finding out more about what actually happened and went on, and I can appreciate you may feel differently if you already know the details",positive
Killing Season,"Where to start? Don't second-guess yourself: it's been panned for a reason. It is an ugly, pointless potboiler lacking in brains, charisma and even the slightest hint of excitement. What follows is one and a half hours of very crude torture scenes, mock character development, Macgyver-like scenarios of escape and an abundance of completely unnecessary CGI effects.It just reeks of ""cut and dry"". Obviously it was too much effort to spend time on practical special effects so the director just found a cheap CGI company to scribble in the animals, the weapon effects, the squibs, the sunsets, the lighting, and anything else he can think of. Poor direction. Frankly I would think after such long and successful careers that Travolta and De Niro were beneath such roles. Travolta, as always, brings a kind of raw energy to his role and immerses himself in his character, even if his accent is off he never winks to the audience and does his best to do his job to a good standard. De Niro, however, is out of his element here, with a slipping southern accent that wasn't necessary. He feigns injury like Pierce Brosnan (poorly). Even when threading a metal cable through the exposed wound in his leg he is not convincing. After a poorly conceived prologue, a taut first act will draw you in, but unfortunately it all goes downhill from there. The sheer excess of symbolism and foreshadowing is a clumsy misfire. Macgyver scenarios pile up quickly and the action climax will have you practically laughing at how stupid it is. Seriously. Don't pay to watch this crap.",negative
Killing Season,These actors portrayed the men that the script was written for. De Niro acted like a man who lives in the woods alone and likes country music and as far as Travoltas accent sounds like a man who has tried to speak English as a Serbian the best he can. The guy probably didn't have a great education and that's how he is supposed to sound. Movies aren't supposed to be an adrenaline rush all the time. Its a story about something that could have actually happened. People aren't perfect maybe the things that they did were on purpose. Use your brain! My husband served in the military and served with men from Bosnia and that's how they sound. Its a good movie. Not every story has to end in someone dying.,positive
Backtrack,"One cannot be mistaken when casting Adrien Brody, he delivers one hundred percent regardless of the movie's genre or budget restriction. One of the better parts of ""Backtrack"" is his believable struggle to overcome his past. It also manifests a few intense scary moments from its fantastically eerie atmosphere, although it has lesser amount of horror finesse when it finishes than when it starts.Peter (Adrien Bordy) is a psychologist who is either being haunted or having a mental breakdown, he's seeing people who isn't there and constantly harassed by them. Hoping to attain some manner of peace he travels back to his past. Adrien Brody is a master of the art, he can convey the dread of the character, be it from body language or actual pleading word.For the movie to work, audience must be inclined to invest on his ordeal, and it surely succeeds in that. There's a hefty amount of seclusion as the movie follows Peter in his lonely endeavor. The rest of the cast play their parts commendably, Sam Neill and Robin McLeavy help in setting the tone as characters Peter encounters. They add to the mystery aspect on early and latter parts, respectively.The set-up is one of the more alluring horror starts in recent days. Its perpetual raining and view of trains leaving the station are astoundingly good. However, the opening vistas fare better in graphic department than the rest. It also tends to falter around the last act since it might not be as equally captivating as the opening act. Few of the horror apparitions work better on the expectation of entity rather than the showing itself.The mix between horror and mystery is a nice invite, it may hit a few bumps on latter half, yet the precise acting from the lead and cool atmosphere are worth the trip.",negative
Backtrack,"I was fortunate enough to catch Backtrack in Toronto at After Dark. I was so glad I did because its actually one of the most exciting films of its kind that I have seen in the last few years. Adrien Brody's psychologist Peter Bower has his world shattered when he realizes that his patients are not actually alive and are in fact ghosts. These ghosts cause Peter to uncover a terrifying secret from his past, all the while he must deal with the loss of his daughter.I enjoyed going into this film blind, maybe check out the trailer but avoid spoilers at all costs! Backtrack works best when its mystery slowly unwinds on screen and you find yourself alongside this psychologist as he attempts to uncover the truth. The film comes to a really satisfying conclusion to all its madness too, I haven't been able to get it out of my mind for the last month or so. The performances are absolutely great and really sell the mystery. Adrien Brody is haunting on screen, Sam Neill is a welcome presence and fans of Mad Max will enjoy seeing Bruce Spence show up too. Big winding mysteries usually live and die based on how good their casts are at selling it and these guys do an amazing job. I can't wait to see this one again when its in regular release. Give it a go! With such an intriguing storyline you really can't go wrong.",positive
Cuban Fury,"CUBAN FURY is yet another British comedy that isn't very funny. The concept - a workplace love triangle in which our portly hero has to return to his childhood love of salsa in order to win over the hot new American manager from his obnoxious co-worker - is sound but the jokes are too few, the direction is generic and, in a film which is all about dancing, it's all too obvious that Nick Frost as the lead can't actually dance very well. Among the supporting cast Ian McShane is nicely seedy and Kayvan Novak steals the show as a camp Persian fellow-dancer, but there's not enough of them and too much of Nick Frost being clumsy and Chris O'Dowd being a jerk.",negative
Cuban Fury,"After a terrible bullying experience, Bruce Garrett (Nick Frost) has now become an ego-deflated, self-loathing, trapped as a wallflower young engineer who lost all hopes of ever being in love with his only escape is eating at Nando's take-outs. When the arrival of his new boss, an American named Julia (Rashida Jones), his lease on life turns for the better. However, he does feel worthy enough to win her love. His dominant male colleague named Drew (Chris O'Dowd) naturally steps up to the plate to win her heart. Within a twist of irony, she has a very true passion for a man who could dance, particularly salsa dancing, which he is master in that craft. Bruce gets drawn back to the inner demons that has been haunting him for a long time. But through trail and error along with some persuasion from his sister Sam (Olivia Colman), Bruce must regain the dancing skills he once perfected and to try to the win the heart out of Julia up on the dance floor.If you've seen the 1993 ""Strictly Ballroom"", you'll simply enjoy ""Cuban Fury"", a film that juxtaposes the romantic comedy romp along with the art of salsa dancing to keep you both entertained while you hum to the music as the dancing will come after you something fierce. The movie like ""Strictly Ballroom"", has its share of intriguing characters that are both humorous and very effective in their actions and the dialogue. Television director James Griffiths in his movie debut antes up the charm factor with two great performers like Nick Frost and Chris O'Dowd who's charismatic nature about them never keeps the story from becoming mundane. To those who love salsa dancing may sit still on their seats as Frost and O'Dowd will melt your heart in amazement as they will compete against each other and will dance their hearts out as a way to reach their goals to win the heart of Julia. In the in it isn't Bruce or Drew that's the winner, but for the dance enthusiast, it's the audience that's the winner. By the time we get introduced to Nick Frost's character, a bulbous, loner of a man who's now a high-ranking industrial machinery designer who was a salsa dancer expert was haunted 22 years ago from a legion of bullies were on the prowl who made him swallow his costume sequins. But his desire to dance returns once his new boss, Julia enters his life who has a fascination for salsa. A memorable scene was when they were in the corridor and their name tags magnetize together was quite precious. What's also hilarious is that her name is Julio. The real scene stealer is Chris O'Dowd as Bruce's rival who also has the hots for Julia, Drew. He's a jerk who likes to tell dirty jokes and makes seductive passes towards Julia.But it's not just Bruce, Julia and Drew that carry the whole movie. We have Kayvan Novak as Bejan who's also a salsa impresario who encourages Bruce to shave his chest hairs, get a superficial tan and to purchase a silk tan. Olivia Colman who plays Bruces's sister Sam persuades him to relinquish from his comfort zone and takes him to a tavern and gives him some shots where she works while sporting a Polynesian call-girl uniform. Rory Kinnear who plays Bruce's friend Gary who's confused by the situation involving Bruce and Bejan. There's a plethora of great scenes involving Burce and his former salsa dancing coach, Ron Parfitt played by Ian McShane as he get him to regain a talent he lost as he had the ""legs of a stallion and the arms of an eagle"". McShane has great depth along with compelling facial expressions which flows along the film quite nicely. The principal leads are virtually sublime and this film is a dynamic underdog story as Frost tries everything to overcome his inner demons to dazzle us with his one hidden talents with his supreme salsa moves which will likely melt your heart like a hot knife through butter. Jones is quite superb as her natural beauty and charm she's in the middle of Bruce and Drew's competitive ways to win her approval. Watch for a cameo from Simon Pegg in a memorable scene in a parking lot where Bruce and Drew are competing against each other showing off their salsa dancing skills. The climax is very exciting as the two rivals compete on the dance floor and is backed by wonderful music and the adrenaline pulsing sound of the crowd as the heart pounds while the rhythms to the sound will likely sweep you off your feet. You never know this movie may inspire you to want to learn the art of salsa dancing.",positive
Phoenix,"The plot rests on the impossible premise that a friend would not fully disclose one's husband's betrayal. This makes absolutely no sense. I don't want to see you be hurt further by chasing after a lying scumbag of a husband, so I tell you that he betrayed you. I also tell you that he is after your family's money. It seems to me that this is the most difficult reveal, causing pain of course, but necessary pain. Why in the world wouldn't I ALSO show you the proof that he divorced you?The movie inches tediously ahead for hours dependent on this ridiculous plot. One moment of unintentional comic relief: Nelly walks like a depressed Frankenstein for the first half of the movie - one assumes she sustained an injury in the camps that explains her flat footed gait. But, tada! All it takes is one comment from her husband and suddenly she's cured!Even the title is irritating - nothing is redemptive in this movie - what waste of acting talent here.",negative
Phoenix,"""I feel wherever I go, that tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here, and always too soon"" ‚Äì Speak Low, Kurt Weill and Ogden Nash Just released from Auschwitz, Nelly Lenz's (Nina Hoss) face is disfigured and bandaged as she crosses a checkpoint in Berlin in 1945 with her friend Lene (Nina Kunzendorf), a worker for the Jewish Agency for Palestine. Though Nelly is free to go anywhere, she is encouraged by Lene to move to Haifa, but is reluctant to move on. Based on a novel by Hubert Monteilhet from a screenplay co-written by the director and the late Harun Farocki, Christian Petzold's Phoenix explores the reality of German guilt and the trauma of those who survived, focusing on two people, one who desperately wants to forget the past and the other who is unable to let go of it.Before undergoing restorative surgery, Nelly says, ""I want to look the same as before,"" but it is not to be. Her face is rebuilt but she is now unrecognizable and only a sad reminder of the alluring night club singer she used to be, a shadow who walks ghost-like through the ruins of Berlin searching for her husband Johnny (Ronald Zehrfeld), whose love she claims was the only thing that kept her alive in the dark days. Lene tells her to stay away, that Johnny, a non-Jew, betrayed her to the Nazis and then divorced her, but Nelly refuses to believe it is true. The record shows, however that Johnny was arrested on October 4th and released on October 6th, the same day Nelly was arrested.When she finds the former pianist, now a busboy in a night club named ""The Phoenix,"" he notices that she looks like Nelly but is so convinced that his wife is dead that he cannot give credence to the thought of her survival. Whether he truly does not recognize her or simply cannot confront the role he played in her arrest is uncertain but brings to mind the proverbial saying, ""There are none so blind as those that will not see."" Johnny sees only that Nelly, having lost her family in the war, stands to inherit a small fortune locked away in a Swiss bank. Creating the atmosphere of a Hitchcock-like film noir, Johnny's small, crowded apartment becomes the location where a scheme is hatched in to claim Nelly's money and divide it between them. To that end, Johnny trains her to look, act, and talk like Nelly.The beleaguered woman plays his game, not knowing where it will lead but afraid to tell him the truth. Masterly crafted by Petzold and cinematographer Hans Fromm, Phoenix is marked by stunning performances from Zehrfeld who co-starred in Petzold's last film Barbara, and by Nina Hoss whose haunting performance is unforgettable. Hoss' shattered look, repressed emotions, and shaky voice are so natural that her gradual awakening to the reality of what her life is about truly epitomizes a Phoenix rising from the ashes. Though oddly rejected by both Cannes and Venice, Phoenix may be remembered long after the Festival winners have been forgotten, particularly the film's final scene, a moment that is so resonant and powerful that it may become an important part of film history.",positive
Nothing to Hide,"I don't understand what is the point of copying another movie in a new film, this movie is just a copy of an Italian movie released couple years ago (perfect strangers), with the same characters, idea, and every single detail, thanks god they changed the names here to French ones.
Besides.. the actors perfermance here sucks! It was really very bad!!",negative
Nothing to Hide,This movie is super entertaining and all of the little twist will have your jaw dropped and laughing. I love how the characters work so well together and the end will leave you completely shocked. Really entertaining,positive
Don't Hang Up,are all straight up pranks. I just want to shake anyone and throttle them until they come to their senses to claim this utter garbage is worth watching. Literally anything on CW is more entertaining to watch. Terrible twist that anyone could figure out. Direction is boring. CGI and use of social media is artificial. Actors are God awful. So much to dislike. The only reason I sat and watched the whole dreadful affair is because I am zapped of any energy due to the flu. I am easily amused and entertained when I super sick. So that's how I know how bad this movie is. Shame on anyone writing that this movie is clever and interesting. This is the kind of movie that is so bad that I am angry after watching it.,negative
Don't Hang Up,"Just got done watching it. Really liked it, nothing new but well done on old ideas. Kind of a cross between ""I know what you did last summer"" and ""saw"" with maybe a little ""are you in the house alone"" mixed in. High tension throughout, kept me interested and played out well. Lots of horror tropes that we all know and love (well some of us anyway) Looking at IMDb reviews and a lot of people didn't like it. But they're the same people who only like the artsier horror like Babadook or The Witch. Both good movies but sometimes you just want a good old fashioned slasher, something that doesn't make you think or try and figure it out. This is that movie.Good production value, good use of lighting, sound etc. Acting was decent and even though the ideas were old I thought the way they were brought about was good. I give it an 8 of 10, good use of an hour and a half on a boring night.",positive
Just Before I Go,"This was a sweet romantic comedy, with a bit a sadness thrown in, which should have been rated at least a strong 7 on IMDb...The story and script is right out of real life and Courtney Cox must be proud of her first directorial effort...She even had her ex David Arquette in the film.But, the big surprise was Seann William Scott, who after an over the top role in ""Goon,"" comes back with a low key sensitive performance miles away from ""American Pie"" or ""Dude Where's My Car."" He's a broken hearted guy who returns his hometown to settle scores and then kill himself. Luckily for him distractions and romance gives him a change of heart.Yet the film also rests on a strong supporting cast...Olivia Thirlby, Garreth Dillahunt,Kate Walsh and even the 50s teen queen Connie Stevens are there to help Scott's character.This is nice feel good film that deserves good distribution.",negative
Just Before I Go,"Being a Sean William Scott fan I thought I'd watch this movie and boy am I glad I did. I was dubious at first as Courtney Cox was directing it but I gotta admit - she nailed it. This movie hits on many layers in life, some things you'll relate to, others you won't but you'll understand where it's coming from. It's a dark comedy drama with some smutty but funny humour that will either have you laughing out loud or looking on in shock. This movie is not only great acting, writing and directing but it has many hidden messages in it which makes you think about your own life, family amongst other things. Acting wise this is Sean William Scott's best movie. I cannot recommend this enough and I hope it gets the recognition it deserves. You rarely wake up the following day thinking what a great movie you watched last night - well, this is one of them.",positive
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Maybe the movie gets more intelligible and interesting later, but we were so bored and tired of listening to the actors whine and yell that we quit early. Life's too short.Most everything was very unrealistic, which is especially unfortunate when the story is supposedly a TRUE one. The characters weren't as smart and level-headed as their history suggests they should be. And there was non-stop idiotic vocabulary and violence. No thank you.Basically, the film is an opportunity wasted. Huge bummer. We would have loved to have seen the real story with believable characters and scenarios.",negative
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"How a crime drama with such good cast can be so dull is borderline a crime. The actors are good, but the characters they play have the personality of barren unsympathetic schmucks. The screenplay and conversation are dry, primarily dabbling in curses and complaints for nearly the entire movie. While there are clearly a couple of good moments by the actors, they are too few to sustain interest for the rest of boring banters.Kidnapping Mr. Heineken is exactly what it advertises, the story of five men who are down on their luck and decide to snatch a billionaire in hope for monetary gain. It's amazing that none of these five character is even close to being relatable. The movie tries to depicts individuals who are pushed to do illegal things, yet they are all manipulative, aggressive and severely lacking empathy.At latter half they are even interchangeable since everyone has a knack for whining, in exception of Sam Worthington's character who surprises audience with poor and crazy decisions. Probably the best decision the movie did was to put Anthony Hopkins as Heineken in a box and let him do a few monologues. Still, there is no tangible connection between Heineken and the kidnappers, there's not even connection between the kidnappers. When the movie tries to pull friendship theme, it only makes things more awkward.For action crime, one would expect an intelligent plot, perhaps major twists and thought out plans. There's a barely any level of sophistication here as five of them partially wing it and hope for the best. In fact, most of the times they are just fooling around, laughing annoyingly and verbally abusing each other.The film offers the shallow sense of helplessness and uneasiness as audience watch five aversive men threatening an old man for money and bicker with each other.",positive
The Starving Games,"A few weeks ago, upon discovering known and universally panned parody filmmakers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer were making a parody of the popular franchise The Hunger Games, I sent out a message on Twitter I thought would be seen as encouraging to some. It read, ""Encouragement to young filmmakers: whatever you're writing now is infinitely better than the new parody film The Starving Games. Soon after sending the tweet, I received a reply from the film's official Twitter reading, ""Great! We're working on The Starving Games 2!"" The fact that the PR/marketing campaign for the picture needs to reply in a smarmy way to negative feedback online about their film shows about as much maturity on their part as the film at hand. Unsurprisingly, The Starving Games is another miserable endeavor of a parody movie, directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the same men who have brought you Date Movie, Epic Movie, Vampires Suck, among other installments of the dead parody genre. That's right, I'm referring to the genre as dead now. Consider my reviews of A Haunted House and Movie 43 (which I'll throw in the same genre since it revolves around many self-referential skits and lampoons A-list actors) the genre's funeral service and this one a visit to its gravesite. What has happened to a genre so promising and so filled with life? The simple answer is it has been reduced to what appears to be a cinematic competition between writers to incorporate as many pop culture and movie references in one film as possible. In the first few minutes of The Starving Games, we are annihilated as viewers by the abundance of references thrown at us, as if it's a commercial break on Television in mid-December and we're trying to decide on what toy to buy our children. The Friedberg and Seltzer formula is to have no continuity, no logic, and no wit in their story. Just clobber together every successful film character, pop culture icon, current celebrity, etc into roughly eighty minutes and string it along with a loose plot and hope someone laughs (or enough sales come through to cash a large check).As inferred by the title, the film is one long parody of the popular book/film franchise The Hunger Games, with the protagonist of Katniss Evergreen now under the name ""Kantmiss Evershot,"" an inept archer who now must fight for her life in the game where her and another opponent must kill one another in The 75th Annual Starving Games. The winner receives an old ham, a coupon for a foot-long sub sandwich, and a partially eaten pickle. The person who sits through this film in its redundant, eighty minute glory gets nothing but a shorter amount of time left in their day.With all the disgustingly unfunny references, I'm glad this film was shot, edited, and completed before Miley Cyrus and the ""twerking"" phenomenon became mainstream. If I had to witness something of that caliber in a film that already breathlessly tries to include the ""Gangnam Style"" musician Psy, the whole Avengers squad, Harry Potter and his friends (who are told to get out of the film because their franchise has ended), and the cast of action movie legends from The Expendables, I would've probably given up.The reason why I resist discrediting or shattering the likely large egos of directors Friedberg and Seltzer is because, well, why bother? They have found a formula that pays big money and have capitalized off of the lowest common denominator of wit and intelligence there is in the cinematic world. I am anticipating reviews of The Starving Games that consist of death threats, comments about the devolution of humor because of the directors' films, and remarks of their worthlessness because of their filmography. Reviews of their films have become as predictable as the films they make, so why bother attacking them? All I can say is be grateful this one is confined to a video-on-demand released and a very limited theatrical release, as opposed to their other films which garnered wide releases. Let's hope their window of release just becomes smaller and smaller over time.The Starving Games and films like it don't make me angry anymore. They just make me sad. It makes me upset to see films like these gain an audience of young teens who are already experiencing shorter attention spans thanks to Television and the internet. I'd let my twelve year old child watch the original Halloween before a film by Friedberg and Seltzer. Or, better yet, the original Airplane! or The Naked Gun series, both starring the gifted comedy actor Leslie Nelson. Those films worked because they spoofed their own genres and didn't try to incorporate every current celebrity and movie figure that has rose to prominence since their last film. There is no reason anyone should see The Starving Games, but, oh, people will.Run and tweet that.Starring: Maiara Walsh, Brant Daugherty, and Cody Christian. Directed by: Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer.",negative
The Starving Games,"I don't really understand what people expect to find when they decide to watch movies like this. I do know what I can expect, because they are always the same. If you like this type of ridiculous, non-intelligent, dirty comedy, good. If not, why do you bother?I had a good few laughs with this movie, and it entertained me more than other films that apparently are great (see pacific rim). This movie is not pretentious nor tries to amuse you with new, all fantastic jokes. It doesn't need much budget and it's something I appreciate. It's also better than other predecessors such as Disaster Movie or Epic Movie (those were actually quite bad). As I said before: if you like the Scary Movie saga and related spoof movies, go for it.Now, 10 is probably a bit overrated, but I can't stand the 3 or so score that this movie shows at the moment, while other trash is in the 7s range.I expect a lot of clicks on the NO button regarding if this review was useful to you. Please, be my guest, I wouldn't have it any other way. The day I am loved by the masses will be the day that I start rating movies like twilight with a score of over 5.",positive
Very Good Girls,"Review: I wasn't that impressed with this dull chick flick about 2 friends who fancy the same man. The two teenagers are desperate to lose there virginity and whilst walking on the beach, they bump into the ice cream boy who they both find quite attractive. One of the girls tries her utmost to get the boys attention while the other girl uses the shy approach. I found the movie quite slow and boring in parts. The acting wasn't that great but I liked the chemistry between the two girls. The director tried to add family elements to try and make it more interesting but I struggled to stay awake. The boy, played by Boyd Holbrook, seemed a bit useless and he kept on popping into to scenes, out of the blue. You also didn't know anything about the boys history so he seemed like a bit of a shady character. Anyway, I didn't really enjoy this film that much but I'm sure that there are many ladies that will get emotional whilst watching it. Unimpressed!¬†Round-Up: Dakota Fanning really had a promising start to her career with movies like Man On Fire, War Of The World's and I Am Sam, but her choice of projects has been her downfall. Movies like Effie Gray, Night Moves and The Motel Life, haven't been that great and it doesn't look like she has anything interesting in the pipeline. Maybe she peaked to early! Her best friend, played by Elizabeth Olsen, is in the new Avengers movie and she also starred in Captain America, Oldboy and Godzilla so she can't complain about her career so far. The problem is that I can't remember seeing her face in any of those movies so she couldn't have made a big impact. Personally I think that she is the best thing in this movie, even though Demi Moore, Richard Dreyfuss, Ellen Barkin and Clark Gregg have cameo roles but they weren't in the movie that much.I recommend this movie to people who are into their emotional dramas about 2 best friends who fancy the same boy. 3/10",negative
Very Good Girls,"I thought this movie was great, it's a good chick flick with sad moments and happy moments in it. This movie was full a great performances mainly by Dakota Fanning.

Black Butterfly,"I watched this film primarily based on the other glowing reviews in IMDb. I try screening on IMDb, Rotten T. & Netflix to keep from wasting time and being disappointed. This film currently has a 50% rating on the Tomato Meter, so I realized it was a gamble.The main issue for me was that the plot strained any sense of credibility in a real world setting starting from the point where the two main characters begin to establish a relationship. I always appreciate a clever plot twist, however, while said plot twist is delivered well towards the end of the story, the scenario is so implausible that I felt I had really wasted my time. The ending was a bit of a clich√© (some might consider another ""twist"") and was equally disappointing.If you don't mind films that deviate sharply from the real world, then you might find this entertaining.... otherwise, I'd recommend staying away.",negative
Black Butterfly,"Director/actor Brian Goodman ('Catch Me If You Can', 'Blow', 'What Doesn't Kill You, etc) directs this surprising thriller with aplomb. The film is a re-make of the French film 'Papillon Noir' as adapted for the English version by arc Frydman and Justin Stanley. It is a gripping suspense film with a terrific twist at the end that few if any will see coming.Paul (Antonio Banderas), a lonely, reclusive alcoholic, down-on-his-luck, divorced screenwriter, who after a tense encounter at a diner invites Jack (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) a mysterious vagabond, to stay at his woodland home while a serial killer preys on young women in the area. The demanding Jack muscles his way into Paul's work. As a storm cuts off power to the isolated cabin, the two men begin a jagged game of one- upsmanship that will bring at least one tale to an end. Paul's realtor (Piper Perabo) makes a few appearances, enough to establish her role in the surprising climax. In many ways the story centers on writer's bloc as well as trusting outsiders and the mixture makes a very fine film.The ending is a bit long in the tooth but the shock of the conclusion makes up for all flaws. Banderas and Rhys Myers are very fine in these very strange roles.",positive
Experimenter,"I am a completely ignorant of Stanley Milgram's and his work, I wasn't really sure what I was getting into when I picked this movie last night outside of knowing it was a biopic. I actually watched this film with friends and we were found ourselves talking about it long afterwards.Peter Sarsgaard, does very well portraying the somewhat dispassionate and yet intelligent Milgram. There is a deep intelligence in this man, and a yearning to understand why we act the way we do when authority is imposed on ourselves, yet there is a severe emotional disconnect between implementing his experiments and discussing the fruits of his labor. When describing and explaining his work, he certainly does so in a very straightforward manner, but what the results say much about us as individuals and as a society. They certainly are noteworthy and it explains why he became such a noteworthy person in media and in the psychiatric world. Winona Ryder plays his loyal and supportive wife, who although may question his methods at times, certainly stands by his side throughout the events in this film. Several notable actors portray colleagues, participants, and other persons of interest throughout the film and add real talent and depth in the cast.There were some film experiments going on in the film itself, in terms of direction and visual representation of ideas. Milgram directly addresses the audience at times, breaking the rules of the '4th wall' by acknowledging you directly at the beginning of the film. At other times he breaks mid scene to address you again. There is a visual representation of the 'elephant in the room' when he discusses difficult topics that explain some of his more controversial methods during the early 60's. A flat 2 dimensional backdrop was used when visiting his old colleague and mentor, perhaps to represent a dull and somewhat awkward afternoon tea with someone he may have actually despised. Some of these methods were interesting, but most felt like a juxtaposition for the rest of the movie that was filmed in a much more typical manner.The questions raised by Migram's experiments are important ones. Why do we blindly follow orders? When do we take responsibility for our own actions? What percentage of people will say no and stand up to authority? His work had a common theme about human nature, and the results of which are somewhat disturbing and controversial to understand. They often display a dispassionate and often cruel side of ourselves, and that can be the most difficult answer to recognize.An interesting film and worth your time if you are curious about his life and works.6/10",negative

Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas,"This movie is so, so utterly wretched, not only in its execution but also in its conception.Just from a filmmaking perspective, it's extremely shoddy. Many portions look like home movies. A large part of the film is Cameron sitting in a car talking to a friend, and that's not interesting to watch. ""Comedy"" scenes have nothing to do with the rest of the story, and are creepily unfunny. A bizarre dance scene at the end is out of place and seems inserted to extend the time. Cameron's presence here is smarmy and smug; he lays out his spiritual views and his friend just gushes about how right Cameron is and how he's helped him see the light and love Christmas and all that. A bigger problem is the misinformation that Cameron spews so authoritatively, some of which runs counter to the Bible and to known history. To give a partial list:Cameron claims that Joseph and Mary were hiding from soldiers sent by Herod to kill all babies being born. But the Gospel of Matthew says the soldiers were sent by Herod AFTER Jesus was born, when Herod was tipped off by the visiting Wise Men that a King of the Jews had been born. Joseph and Mary then took Jesus and did the Flight into Egypt to save the child's life.Cameron insists the Nativity took place in a cave because the manger was made of stone. No source claims the manger was stone, or that the Nativity took place in a cave. Matthew says it was in Joseph's house in Bethlehem, Luke says it was a stable.

Although myrrh had been used in Egyptian mummification, frankincense was not, and both were much more commonly used as a sacred incense in Hebrew temples.He goes into detail about Saint Nicholas' life, presenting it as fact, but in truth very little is known for sure about him, and some Christian leaders openly suggest that he may never have existed. All that is known for sure is that someone named Nicholas was at one point the Bishop of Myra; everything else is unsure and in the territory of legend and myth.Legend has it that during the Council of Nicaea, Nicholas angrily struck Arius in the face for saying that Jesus and God were separate. Cameron depicts Nicholas savagely and brutally attacking Arius and beating him with a shepherd's crook, a scene many Christians found objectionable.Cameron depicts the historical Saint Nicholas climbing on a sleigh to deliver presents to children, something he never did in any legend. He also claims that Saint Nicholas is the gift-giver everywhere, also not supported by history. Some areas give gifts on Christmas, others at Epiphany, others on St. Nicholas' day, and in some areas the gifts are delivered by someone else entirely, such as La Befana in Italy, St. Basil in Greece, the Yule Lads in Iceland, St. Lucy in Croatia, and multiple countries have the gifts delivered by the Magi, angels, or the Christ Child himself. Cameron says Nicholas was ""sainted,"" when in reality Nicholas was never canonized. His sainthood was more by word-of-mouth.Cameron makes an elaborate rationalization for Christmas trees relating to the crucifixion and to the Garden of Eden; this connection is very convoluted and labored, and doesn't hold water. And he doesn't address the parts of Jeremiah which some feel are a commandment against Christmas trees.He claims that gifts piled under the Christmas tree are perfectly acceptable as they are reminiscent of the skyline of Jerusalem. By that reasoning, they could also be the skyline of Babylon or Rome, and could represent oppression and slavery. It's a poorly considered analogy that should never have been included.I'm sure I'm missing other bits, but I'm not inclined to go back and watch it again. It's unsettling to see Cameron stand and claim that it's OK to be materialistic at Christmas, because that's when God came to the Earth in material form. (That's pretty much a direct quote.) Never mind the many passages where the Bible tells us to set aside worldly things and not be materialistic! He exhorts viewers to eat themselves to bursting and buy the biggest ham and the richest butter....but isn't gluttony considered a deadly sin?At no point does he address such issues as helping the poor, feeding the hungry, giving to charity, volunteering, or anything. One is left with the impression that one should only think of one's self and one's immediate family and friends. Does Cameron remember Jesus' command to his followers to give away all they had to the poor? Somehow, I don't think so.Cameron gives the impression of someone who read parts of the Bible long ago, but rather than fit his life to the Bible, he is fitting the Bible to the life he wants to lead, and making one justification after another without ever bothering to double-check if he's remembering it correctly, or if there's something in the Bible that disagrees with him. It's clear he considers himself a better Christian than you. Many of the faithful have been turned off by this movie, some even going so far as to declare it blasphemous and call Cameron a false prophet. I'm not so sure I would agree, but at the same time, this movie does have some value of showing how even a faithful Christian can fall victim to the sins of pride and arrogance. It's clear that Cameron's ego was in overdrive, and this movie is not as much a testament to God as it is an expression of Cameron's arrogance.",negative
Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas,"This movie is so, so utterly wretched, not only in its execution but also in its conception.Just from a filmmaking perspective, it's extremely shoddy. Many portions look like home movies. A large part of the film is Cameron sitting in a car talking to a friend, and that's not interesting to watch. ""Comedy"" scenes have nothing to do with the rest of the story, and are creepily unfunny. A bizarre dance scene at the end is out of place and seems inserted to extend the time. Cameron's presence here is smarmy and smug; he lays out his spiritual views and his friend just gushes about how right Cameron is and how he's helped him see the light and love Christmas and all that. A bigger problem is the misinformation that Cameron spews so authoritatively, some of which runs counter to the Bible and to known history. To give a partial list:Cameron claims that Joseph and Mary were hiding from soldiers sent by Herod to kill all babies being born. But the Gospel of Matthew says the soldiers were sent by Herod AFTER Jesus was born, when Herod was tipped off by the visiting Wise Men that a King of the Jews had been born. Joseph and Mary then took Jesus and did the Flight into Egypt to save the child's life.Cameron insists the Nativity took place in a cave because the manger was made of stone. No source claims the manger was stone, or that the Nativity took place in a cave. Matthew says it was in Joseph's house in Bethlehem, Luke says it was a stable.

The Forger,"This was actually a decent film to watch. Don't be mistaken it is not an action movie about a heist job. This is a film about the length that a father will go to be there for his sick child.John Travolta plays a forger who has 10 month left on his sentence, but decided to do a dirty deal with a gangster to get him out earlier. While this comes as a surprise to most other characters, it is later revealed that he had to do it. Keegan played Anson Mount, is the guy that got him out and is now asking John to forge a masterpiece in exchange for his services. This is where the plot thickness (LOL) John meets and realizes that Abigail Spenceris who plays agent Paisley is a cop, this intrigues her and she starts to follow him. Without going into to much detail of the film, John's character Raymond is only trying to be a good father. He is doing everything he can to help his son while his own life is getting more and more dangerous.The acting in this film was for most part great. John Travolta does a great job, Raymond has some very unique trait marks that are very different to all other characters that John has played over his great career. Anson at first seemed like the wrong guy, but by the middle of the film when the plot gets revealed you realize that his character is suppose to be like that. Abigail was a bit of a waste in this film, she does a good job as the DEA agent, but can't say that she was great, every one else did what they were paid to do.The negative of the film, is that you can see that this wasn't a big budget film and that locations were pretty terrible. They used a school as a prison. hahaha.... and some acting was below average, i just don't want to write names.The story was interesting, had a lot of meaning, and the main character is some-one we all can relate in one sense or another.",negative
The Forger,"The review that caught my eye, before I rented ""The Forger"", was ""Travolta's best performance in ten years..."". But then, just before watching it, I searched for more reviews and saw that some critics panned it. Well, I happy to say they are wrong‚Äîit's a pretty good movie, after all.I mean, come on, critics! I usually agree with you‚Äîbut saying this is too ""slow paced"" and that it has ""two, conflicting, story lines""? I LOVED the pace, and the acting, and, especially the story line(s).OK, so it does have two story lines going on‚Äîthe forgery and heist, and the human interest about the forger's family (his dad, his son, his ex-wife who had not seen the son in years, the female detective...). So what? It's believable (as much as any heist story or human interest story can be) to the point that plot vs. sub-plot is just not a problem.I thought Travolta DID give a heck of a performance. His pace fit the overall pace of the film, as did that of the other actors. And Travolta, who has had his share of sorrow in real life, looked to me like a man who has been there, done that. He looks the part and is very convincing.Everyone actually looked pretty good (or properly bad-ass) thanks to some solid lighting and overall nice cinematography. (This is not some kind of ""art"" film, but nevertheless consistent in it's camera work.) The sound quality was good (a pet peeve of mine in some films) including the music which seemed to fit the film nicely.As for the VERY best performance in the film, besides Plummer, who is always fun to watch for me... it has to be young Tye Sheridan. Nicely understated, smart, believable. I'm looking forward to his next film, whatever it turns out to be.Finally, the director certainly knows a thing or two about film making, as, even with the somewhat slow pace, everything builds mostly evenly towards a satisfying ending. Of course the screenplay had to work too, for that to happen.Bottom line, I'm glad I rented ""The Forger"". I enjoyed pretty much all of it, and even replayed a few parts to study how the film was put together. Probably no Academy Awards coming for this, but all cast and crew can still stand tall.",positive
Remember,"In a striking similarity to Memento, a forgetful man wanders around with one goal of finding the men from his past. This is not the ordinary thriller as it's significantly slower with a peculiar lead character, yet it's surprisingly just as effective as any high octane action . The journey is not a happy one, and it builds audience's expectation in clever way that when the goal is reached, none of the outcomes seems to be pleasant.Zev (Christopher Plummer) is an old man with dementia. After the death of his wife, his friend hands him a letter containing a mission to find the men from Auschwitz. Christopher Plummer is truly exceptional, he displays the courage as though his character is a secret agent despite deep down he's plagued with terror and uncertainty. His often meek demeanor is sympathetic to watch, but at the same time one can invest in his endeavor and motive.The visual and audio are designed to create suspense even in trivial moments. Its main focus is a man with dementia, and little things might rattle him, so any bump in the trip proves to be challenging. Acting from the rest of cast is commendable. Characters would most likely help Zev, yet there's an unsettling feeling that their reactions can be antagonistic, especially since Zev is not particularly suave with words.It plays with the awkward situation really well with the solemn music and view of scenery that feels darker even though it never literally becomes that way. On the other hand, this could also hamper the pace. This is far from action thriller, more investment is made towards the drama instead of gun-slinging action.Zev's adventure is a bizarre and slow one, it's an ironic tale of both kindness and cruelty of others. Unsettling yet charming in its somber steps.",negative
Remember,"There have been a lot of movies about the Holocaust in the last couple of years, some very good. But none have had the suspenseful screenplay of Remember. This movie is one of the best efforts from director Atom Egoyan since he showed such promise with The Sweet Hereafter in the late 1990s. Perhaps the secret here was his using someone else's screenplay rather than his own.Excellently acted (when is Christopher Plummer not excellent?), staged, and filmed, and edited down to a taut 95 minutes, this film succeeds not ""merely"" as a Holocaust reminder but as a self-contained thriller: an engrossing and ultimately thoroughly satisfying piece of cinema.",positive
Dom Hemingway,"From the first moment of the movie when we are 'treated to a rambling monologue from Jude Law using the type of extravagant language no self respecting gangster would use the tone is set. Dom Hemingway is a character that could have been interesting and engaging but Jude Law too often over acts catastrophically converting his performance from amusing to embarrassingly 'hammy' on far too many occasions. His relationship and interaction with Richard. E. Grant's Dickie character provides some of the highlights of the movie but the under use of the relationship and dialogue between these characters was bizarre. Far too little character depth or development is provide and as such by the end I didn't really know or care about who Dom Hemingway really was or what happened to him. Worst of all the relationship with Dom's estranged daughter Evelyn played by Emelia Clarke was an almost non-existent narrative strand when in reality it could and should have been a cornerstone of the story, the result of the mere suggestion of a father and daughter reconciliation story was so under developed and under used that what the film actually provides is a rather pathetic. The story of a daughter abandoned by an imprisoned father due to his adherence to a 'criminal code' could, should and would have provided a worthy central storyline on which the rest of the film could rest, sadly in this case it didn't.Dom Hemingway as a character and movie falls well short of what it could have been, essentially the movie storyline is:- criminal goes to jail for 12 years for honouring a 'criminal code', comes out talking line an extremely angry Royal Shaspearan actor with a cockney accent, gets drunk gets more angry, shouts and swear with , to or act old friends, in passing remembers he has a daughter that he wishes to reconcile with kind of doesn't The End. Style over substance very disappointing.",negative
Dom Hemingway,"I had not intended to watch Dom Hemingway. I never heard about it before it came on while I was tuned to HBO. But its opening scene is hard to ignore. A man in a prison is standing naked while someone (out of the camera view) is giving him a blow job, while the prisoner, who announces that he is the great Dom Hemingway, waxes poetically about the greatness of his cock. Once hooked I couldn't stop watching. Throughout the film Dom speeches have a Shakespeare-like quality about them, not realistic perhaps but fascinating language. I was mesmerized by Jude Law's performance.The plot involves Dom serving 12 years in prison to protect his crime boss, and his odyssey in pursuit of the reward he feels is his due. Dom has anger management issues and is clearly admired by his fellow prisoners and feared by the civilians who know him. Melody is one of the hookers the crime boss rewards Dom with. Later in the film she reappears as a sort of angelic seer who helps him change his life and his luck. On his release from prison Dom meets up with an old friend, a criminal named Dickie, who sticks with Dom on his crusade to get his reward for his 12 year sacrifice. Dickie is played magnificently by Richard E. Grant, a British actor who looks a bit like a young Max von Sydow.",positive
Zashchitniki,"Collection of all the movie clich√©s, plagiarized plot line, mixed with Russian imperialism (somehow claiming former Soviet republics in any stupid way possible). Not good enough to be a joke or a trash...total waste of resources.Do not waste your time on it, not to say - god save you from going to cinema and paying money for this crap.",negative
Zashchitniki,"from the heavy handed introduction / title sequence involving unpleasant manipulation of Humans, I knew I was in for a treat. My viewing pleasure was massively enhanced by the appallingly translated subtitles, (talking about a daughter, saying ""he did this and died"" or something along those lines) The frequent, perplexing ""gazing at another's grief"" scenes with characters that looked as though they had all traces of expression CGI'd from their faces. News bulletins that looked as if the broadcasters didn't really know how serious all this might be. Arsus (the bear) seemed to be suffering some kind of existential crisis going on most of the time, even when he was a bear, and the grinning oaf that seemed to be the bad guy was fantastic, posturing with his hands in the air whilst manipulating his machines. So in all seriousness, one of the best / worst films I have ever experienced in my life of watching Really Bad science fiction films. and believe me this was Really Bad. Great Fun.",positive
The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death,"Oh dear oh dear HAMMER..where do I start with this appalling bit of unimaginative garbage. Lets says a few words for the actors because they are the only good thing in the whole film. They struggle and probably held back their laughter at some of the appalling lines that had to be delivered, and Helen McCrory, why Helen why?? You're an excellent actress especially on stage and you've severely wasted your talent here, your reputation can only be damaged by agreeing to be in this poor excuse for a film.Did they dig up a BBC TV cinematographer who lit an episode of Dr Who in the 1980's??? It was like a watching some lousy cheap xmas special that was knocked out within few days and ZERO thought was given to ""atmospheric lighting"", this is a meant to be a horror film, you have to create atmosphere to keep the mood of the film, to keep an audience scared, enthralled, intrigued, and most importantly make it look COMMERCIAL, not light it in the style of below par art house knock off for a personal showreel, having lens flares and portions of the frame out of focus do not make you artistic DUMMY, they make you look incompetent which this DOP is, did this person just sleep their way through the project, did this silly DOP think for more than 5 minutes, are they capable of one creative thought in their brain?? What on earth is Hammer thinking when they are making a sequel to the biggest hit they've had in years and they employ talentless unimaginative incompetents like this?? Just look across the pond at the US horror films, some may be bad but pretty much all of them at this budget level all look slick, moody, atmospheric and COMMERCIAL not sub par art house. Now lets get on to the director, never heard of him before but again this person shows such a deep lack of understanding of the horror genre that you'd think he just stumbled on the set by accident from a heavy night out and started directing this silly piece of nonsense. He keeps using a scare technique that when you see it the first time you think OK, not bad but then he goes on to repeat it about 11 times more, and by the 11th time you think. PLEASE STOP, GET A CLUE! Along with the useless DOP who probably dominated the director with their appalling shots, this director was just walking through the production for the pay check, hang your head in shame, this was a chance of taking the franchise in new directions but its wasted by a lack of imagination of the horror genre.In summation, this film could have been so good but Hammer in their haste to cash in have misfired and shot themselves in the foot, backside and face.A ROYAL STINKER, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",negative
The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death,"I personally enjoyed the movie very much. It wasn't too scary but it was interesting. If you like a ghost with a back story this is your movie.. Also if you are a young lady a certain fellow is quite darling. It also has a sort of interesting development of the main character as you learn more about her.This movie is not full of action or gore, in fact it's quite simple. Though you are kept thoughtful and wondering. The movie is like a puzzle and you are trying to figure out who lives and who will die. I loved it. I loved the year it was placed in and I loved the child actors. But if you want a very enthralling horror movie, this is not it. It's more of a mystery type with a little romance thrown in.",positive
Tracers,"In an age of slick polished mega-budget CGI Marvel movies, Tracers provides a refreshing antidote, with actors doing the majority of their own CGI free stunts captured by a hand held camera that injects a sense of energy into the film. Targeting a young adult audience with a grittily realistic story in a contemporary setting, Tracers lands squarely on a gap in the market and stars Taylor Lautner, who was considered one of the hottest young actors of his generation at the start of the decade.It's easy to see why Taylor was attracted to the project as it re-teams him with the producers of the multi-billion dollar franchise Twilight (that shot Lautner to global fame) and hooks Taylor up with the stunt co-ordinator behind the Bond and Bourne films, Gary Powell. Allowing Taylor (who trained in martial arts when he was a child) to showcase his natural athletic agility, as his character Cam attempts to escape a debt he owes to loan sharks by joining a Parkour gang who use their skills for dishonest ends.The film zips along at a fair pace jumping straight into the action as Cam literally falls for Nikki, the love interest of the film played by Marie Avgeropoulos, who unwittingly draws Cam into the Parkour gang. Lautner has taken some criticism in the past for his acting, particularly in Abduction, his last action movie. In Tracers Lautner answers his critics, giving his most solid dramatic performance to date. It's not a showy theatrical performance, but a restrained naturalistic one that overcomes the scripts poor dialogue and convincingly conveys young Cam's emotions throughout.Marie Avgeropoulos (best known for TV show The 100) also gives a fine performance in the film, but ultimately the chemistry between the two leads doesn't quite catch fire enough to draw the audience in. This is just one of the films flaws, which has its roots in the clunky script rather than the performances. Unfortunately the film doesn't allow enough time for their relationship to develop and nor do we truly get to understand the peril that Nikki's character is in, which makes it difficult for the audience to truly root for them.In fact the script is where this film takes most of its tumbles, along with the underwritten character development there is a sprinkling of plot holes and a lack of variety in the action sequences. All of this might in part be due to the films US PG-13 certificate which calls for some restraint, leaving some of the dangers the characters face only hinted at. However the film has no aspirations to be Citizen Kane and these shortcomings are easy to overlook.Despite its flaws the film has some nice touches. Spanish director, Daniel Benmayor, in making his Hollywood debut injects a real sense of raw energy into the film. As Miller, a Fagin-esque character played by Adam Rayner who controls the Parkour gang explains how the gang operates to Cam, the film segues beautifully into the next action set-piece. There is a creative use of the sound mix at moments of high tension and even the opening credits have a touch of a Saul Bass flourish about them. Honourable mention should also go to the film's music composer, Lucas Vidal and his energetic score for the movie.Ultimately though the film, whilst enjoyable, fails to live up to its full potential. It is only Taylor Lautner's eminently watchable performance that lifts this film up and pulls the audience through. In the process he demonstrates his leading man credentials and shows Hollywood that they are missing a trick if they don't pair him up with a decent script and an experienced director soon.",negative
Tracers,"I really enjoyed this movie. It did exactly what it intended to do, entertain. The pace was just right for me. The character relationships were, for the most part, believable. I don't think they set out to win an Academy Award, but more to make a quality action film of this genre that would entertain a wide variety of tastes. The ladies will like this along with their men. The only weak spot was the character of Miller and that was more the writing than the acting. Also I cringe when an actors lines have to explain the plot instead of the story itself doing the job but that was very minor in this case. Marie Avgeropoulos is new to me and I want more. I rated it 9 because I got more than I expected. Truthfully I hope there's more. I can easily see how a series of films based from this could be possible.",positive
Blue Mountain State: The Rise of Thadland,"I had high hopes for this movie, why? Well because I have watched Blue Mountain State the TV show for few years.This movie is annoying because it has no rhythm, It's like you are on drugs yourself. All those flashing lights and music for about 95% of the movie makes you go insane. If you like movies that has no script at all, and you like to smoke little bit of the green then this movie is perfect for you LOL.I have spoken to some of my colleagues about this movie and they agree with me and said ""what did I just watch!?""Don't spend you time watching this movie, I don't get it how this movie has a solid 7 out of a 10 here at IMDb.Thanks,Gunnar",negative

There is almost no plot and little to no football but who was watching the show for that part specifically? It was just a bunch of alcohol, drugs, girls, and sex; but that is kind of what to expect from a Blue Mountain State movie. Had a few laughs to die for throughout the movie and found myself genuinely satisfied at the end. So just to sum things up, please don't watch this movie in hopes of seeing a majestic art piece of a film because it's always raining cocaine in Thadland! 10/10 for any fan of the show.",positive
The Pyramid,"The thing with ""the Pyramid"" is that it has great presentation. The poster looks good, the trailer looks good too. It's enough to fool most people into watching it, expecting a film with some good scares. I, for one, went in expecting some claustrophobic terror like ""the Descent"".Unfortunately, the Pyramid is not good, not good at all. In fact, it's just boring. The characters all suffer from being utterly unlikeable, from the annoying cameraman to the just as annoying blonde girl. From there the film turns into a boring drag, wherein every trick in the book is pulled: jump scares, cheap CGI, lots and lots of yelling and screaming, exposition that makes no sense. You name it.This movie is awful. Don't watch it.",negative
The Pyramid,"It happens often that a bad flick is massively overrated at IMDb, but bad ratings are normally trustworthy. Since now i only found a few cases where the bad rating was totally wrong. The Pyramid is one of them.Lots of people write about the bad acting in that movie. Well to be honest at the first 10 minutes of the movie the acting or lets say the script is not that brilliant. And thats normal for this kind of horror movies. You have to always bear the boring beginning where every character is presented and the connections between them are explained. But in The Pyramid that scenery is refreshingly short before the main plot starts.The movie is about claustrophobic sceneries, mystery and the supernatural. And this is done very well. The creatures in that creature horror movie are well made, animated and their background story fits perfectly. This is without any question a professional crafted flick and nothing looks cheap.The whole movie delivers exactly what you are expecting. But in that case with really fresh new ideas and a story which was completely new. And this is great in a time where even high end productions are mostly cheap ripoffs of older movies or new interpretations of stories which where told a hundred times before.The end is also surprising, because in that kind of horror movies you normally can spot out the person which will survive with a 100% accuracy if you are used to that genre.As others mentioned before. The modern concept of ""men in movies are always useless idiots and all women are hard boiled"" is also a part of this movie and its a mood killer. The way the horror movies are made nowadays is that they just replaced the usual two guys of the group which are somehow tough with women and left the rest of the more fearful and useless characters to the men. It does not fit. Light dressed beautiful women in horror movies are there to be eye candy, to mix in some beauty into the horror. And you can spice up the plot with a helpless women which has to be saved. If you do not do that you can just cut out the women and make a male only horror flick, because it will not make any difference. I guess that is the main reason for the bad ratings. A busty pretty girl in a ripped tank top as fan service for the guys and and a bearded muscular hard boiled guy in a dirty white t-shirt as fan service for the girls would have done the trick and the movie would have gotten at least a two point higher rating.But altogether The Pyramid is a well crafted creature horror movie which i have enjoyed very much.",positive
Shaun the Sheep Movie,"13 February 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester This Aftenoon - Shaun The Sheep. I would just like to point out that I was the only adult there without a child.....or maybe I was the only child without an adult!!!!!! Nick Park and his team have done it again. This was classic Aardman animation, with our old pal Shaun. Bored with his mundane life Shaun and his sheepy friends engineer a way to have a day off but all goes drastically wrong when the farmer ends up in the big city with memory loss. It's up to the animals to save him and what follows is a madcap series of events where nobody questions sheep dressed as humans or any of the antics that occur. Completely without dialogue the story is carried along by the excellent score and gesticulations and a gaggle of bleats, grunts and other indiscriminate noises. As we know animation these days caters for all ages and with various movie references included the adults were definitely laughing at different times to the children. Watching some good old stop motion animation is a very pleasant way to pass the time.",negative
Shaun the Sheep Movie,"I never ever go to the cinema (I rather wait for the Blu-ray to be released and just paying once but yet I went to London from Spain just to see this movie. I didn't wanna wait for it to be released here. Shaun the Sheep is a brilliant TV show so when I found out a movie was being made I was totally thrilled. Even though going from the 7-minute episode to a full length movie was a big step, I was confident in Aardman to made the transition easily. They didn't disappoint. First, let me say that I love stop-motion; it's such an ""intimate"" technique due to the fact that you always have to literally be on top of the character to change it every time he makes the slightest movement. But not only is the technique beautiful, the story doesn't disappoint either. This doesn't feel like a dragged out episode of the show, it feels like a story that goes beyond the usual surroundings of the show while still maintaining how everything works. This movie made me laugh a lot. If there's something that Shaun the Sheep always achieved was the ability to create humor of the most simplest situations. But I also cried a lot. Tears of sadness and happiness. And truthfully, I never expected Shaun the Sheep to reach me so deeply. There's a scene where you can see so much pain in Shaun eyes. And that's just clay! My God, congratulations to whoever did that, it was so moving. And I also had a sweet spot about Slip, the dog that Shaun meets early in the movie and come along for the adventure. She was a new character but she felt like and old member of the gang. I haven't enjoyed a movie so much in a long time. And I haven't felt so many thing with a movie in a long time either. So thank you, Aardman, for giving a fan such a great gift.",positive
Reasonable Doubt,"From about minute 1 the story is totally predictable, nothing surprises at all. This would not be so bad, if the story WANTS WANTS WANTS to surprise. But there is not one seductive trace that makes you not keep staring on the solution of every single line of suspense. This story has no power, no energy, no soul, no fire. Some 12 year old kids would probably write a better one. The only thing that really surprises is that good actors like Samuel L. Jackson are playing in this piece of crap.What else can one say about this, besides the fact that the music kind of levels with one of the worst dramas I've seen in months?!Don't even think of seeing this movie.",negative
Reasonable Doubt,Not sure what people expect from a film these days. I thoroughly enjoyed the film from start to finish.There are many films out there that don't make the grade in my opinion this is not one of them. Samuel L was solid as usual a slightly darker film for him I thought but convincing as Clinton Davis. Could have been a little longer perhaps. A good thriller with a twist from the start.Dominic Cooper puts in a decent performance as Mitch Brockden a District Attorney who after believing that Davis is innocent defends him in court.Soon after Davis is set free Mitch is unaware that Davis is hiding a secret that will ultimately destroy him.As a Crime Thriller it's above average and worth a view enjoy.,positive
Qu'est-ce qu'on a fait au Bon Dieu?,"Foolish, humorless,very bad acting,no real feeling, and at one point the sisters and their husbands do something horrible, seemingly totally out of character, but life goes on...Also our young couple reacts to problems in ways that make no sense...",negative
Qu'est-ce qu'on a fait au Bon Dieu?,"Christian Clavier is a comedy legend. It works as a guarantee that the film which he is starring in won't disappoint you. But I'm also glad that a film with this ensemble cast isn't just merely focusing on him and his comedy talent. Everybody in the film gets their spot to shine. Everybody has to deliver a great performance otherwise the film would collapse on itself. Especially the three sons-in-law have a great chemistry together and are extraordinary funny.The plot allows the writers and filmmakers to play with and discuss many important and serious issues, but to present in a humorous and way. Just imagine, that you as a parent of four daughters, get three sons of law with a different religion, ethnic background and not one of them get well with each other. You hope that the last daughter will bring you and ideal contender who meets you demands of a perfect man for your daughter.The French have always been masters at comedy although in the last couple of years that trend has lost a little bit of steam, but it seems to be going at full speed now. After the excellent international success of The Intouchables, comes another film which has a chance for an international recognition. While the main premise and issues may be a bit touchy for some people, every jab at someone be it from ethnic point or religious point can't insult anyone because that is not the point. The point of the humor is look back on the globalization and the problems our multicultural society brings.Relationships are made, men bond with each other but it is no way done in any pathetic way. From my experience this is exactly how things happen - the three sons in law become friends in sharing the goal of being liked the by the father of the family. They become friends in the childlike fashion. Or Clavier's Claude befriends the last rival standing in the way of her fourth daughter to have a happy marriage, by simply having the same hobby - fishing.With 90 minute runtime this comedy doesn't have any spare time to slow down. This is laugh out ride since the start until the finish. I can remember only a handful of times when I have experienced the entire theater to be laughing out loud like this. This is a perfect comedy with the perfect cast and premise.",positive
The Quiet Ones,"The film is slow, plodding and lacks any depth. The scares don't scare. It lacks suspense or creepiness. Character development falls flat on it's face; you just don't become endeared to any of the characters, at all. Rory Fleck-Byrne and Erin Richards seem completely redundant in the film. Jared Harris performed well, but even he couldn't save this one. I think the whole possession thing has been done to death, and to pull it off nowadays takes strong characters, a solid story and a bit of a twist. Insidious for example. I personally wouldn't waste time and money on the film. Wait until it comes on TV in a couple of years. Definitely not a must watch movie.",negative
The Quiet Ones,"Aside from The Exorcist, possession films always seem so lacking. They never have enough real, human tension. They focus on predictable jump scares and an even more predictable plot. It's safe to say that, in general, possession films don't have much to offer. Thankfully, The Quiet Ones does not suffer from the same faults of many other similar films. Rather than simply focus on the dark progression of a possessed being, The Quiet Ones presents the frustrating fears that torment the young, inexperienced scientists, as they struggle with their desire to help a suffering being through the means of science and logic, the underlying threat of possible demonic possession,and the obsessive nature of Professor Coupland. The performance of the cast is top notch, the effects are subtle, the only disappointing aspect was the very, very end, and the fact that as a whole, the film just wasn't that scary. Still, if the concept of possession interests you, but you've been disappointed with past projects, you might want to give this a shot.",positive
These Final Hours,"Meet James. He's an immature guy living his life from one bottle to the next. He's a terrible boyfriend and a cheat. His relationship with his mother is nonexistent. He's a terrible friend. He's an alcoholic and full of aggression and rage and just doesn't care about anyone or anything....until he meets Rose, an innocent little girl looking for her father, on this day, the last day before the end of the world.It might not seem like much, but this is a touching heartfelt story of redemption. It raises the questions: Is it too late to change? Is it too late to realise your mistakes and atone for them? What starts off slow pays off if you stick with it. As you progress through the journey with James and Rose, you'll find yourself caring more and more about them. The climax is worth it and if you don't shed a tear, you'd hardly be human. This is without a doubt one of the best hidden gems I have ever seen. Truly a magnificent experience on a limited budget, but so much more. It's a story that will leave a lasting impression and cause you to look inside yourself. Are you living as well as you could be? What if you didn't have time to correct your sins?Do yourself a favor and see it. I promise that you won't regret it.",negative
These Final Hours,"Wow, I was taken by surprise with this one. What a beautiful film! This may well be the best apocalyptic film I have seen..The film was loaded with great imagery and concepts from the very start... I believe it had its own unique take on the apocalypse which was terrifying and believable.. There is a great unique narration as the film progresses that lets you in on how little time is left..The acting was superb from the two leads, even the child actress was fantastic.... The film made me think how important any meeting or bond can be between us humans regardless of time...This film deserves your attention and to do well...Overall: Beautiful. Add it to your watch list its one of the best films I've watched this year....",positive
The Trust,"Wow I had not watched a movie with such a nonsensical screenplay for a long long time, and I advise you to better use your time.The first half, while incoherent, still makes the story go forward. But the second part, the heist, does not make sense at all.Why would you not trust the guy who serves you potentially hundreds of millions on a plate, the guy who financed the whole operation and worked his ass off to find the information, the guy who is supposed to be your friend, the guy you have been more or less working with for years?If you had such misgivings in the first place, why go along ?And why are you so willing to trust a woman that you don't know, but is waiting in a house with other criminals, where there are more weapons than in an armory ?Why, when you have opened the safe and the millions are ready to be taken, do you let her make a call ? If you are so gullible to believe her reason for the call, why are you so stupid to think it can't way 30 minutes that the wealth is transferred in the van and you are ready to go, before letting her have her phone call?Why are you so willing to kill your partner in crime without any reason to doubt him?Why are you so stupid that you waste time bringing back the charged money and jewel, and put them back in the safe, as if A. You are such a genius you absolutely remember where each belongs, although you did not take part the load up in the bags and did not even watch you partner fill them up. B. You are so sure nobody will come, and you have all the time in the world, and why not make a pizza party while waiting for the mafia to reclaims its due ?",negative
The Trust,"I don't know why people are complaining so much about the ending of this movie. It's really funny and then it gets really serious. Maybe that's a problem for some. I believe the story underneath is about people being corrupt in big and little ways, and whether there's a line you won't cross in your life. Everyone has their own reaction, but I think this movie delivers a lot more than the average crime film and it's all because of the way it ends. The relationship/connection with Nicolas Cage and Elijah Wood is incredible. I thought it was an excellent script, great acting, and all the emotions of a great movie. I enjoyed the entire movie from beginning to end.",positive
Alan Partridge,"As I watched this on my trip to London and have no previous connection to Alan Partridge I cannot judge this against the series, as another reviewer has done already (at least). I can say that I like Steve Coogan a lot, which was one of the main reasons I wanted to see it. And he is a very funny guy. The premise itself has some very funny moments indeed, though it sometimes goes sour in a heartbeat (for all the wrong reasons that is).The movie is somewhat based in reality, but it's an Alan Partridge reality. Still there are too many things that are convenient and most of it is really predictable. Weren't it for the charm of the lead actors and their playing of the roles, I think many more would notice that this runs out of steam quickly (story wise). The finale then is very weird (with police acting even weirder, passive/active wise that is) ... a shorter version would've been much appreciated.",negative
Alan Partridge,"Now let me get this straight. I'm not Alan Partridge. I didn't decide one Monday afternoon, while eating a double decker, to come on to IMDb and give a review. That would be illegal. Neither am I plugging double deckers. They're really nice though, and I reckon Jesus would probably eat them. I digress. Alpha Papa is amazing. Alan Partridge will surely get the Oscar nod for best actor. If you thought Brokeback Mountain was stunning (I didn't) then you'll bend over backwards to watch this. Alan doesn't play a gay cowboy, but rather a non-gay radio show presenter who ends up in a siege (sorry about the spoiler). And he doesn't die at the end either like Bruce Willis in Sixth Sense, or the dog in Bob Marley and Me. No, he lives after enduring what can only be described as an epic battle of man versus another slightly crazy man, who looks a bit like that bloke off Star Trek with the fake Irish accent. Anyway...don't waste your time watching Monsters University or the slightly camp Wolverine who has knives and forks for hands. Watch a real man in action giving the performance of his life.",positive
Nine Lives,"I saw the movie and I would like to comment on the storyline of ""Nine Lives."" I found it to be disturbing. I understand and accept that the cats in the Purr-kins shop were there voluntarily and that some - like Mr. Fuzzy Pants - apparently agreed to donate some of their lives in order to help ""troubled"" humans straighten themselves out. But when the cats were given away, they were soon ""possessed"" by the spirit of the humans that needed their help. The cats ceased to be cats altogether and the humans were trapped inside the cats. If the human possessing the cats could or would not reform, then the cats remained possessed and would be lost forever. If the human successfully reformed, the cats would have to die, in order to release the repentant humans' spirit. Mr. Perkins states that love requires sacrifices. The spirit of Mr. Brand flings the body of Mr. Fuzzy Pants off a skyscraper in a futile attempt to save his son. It is the cat who is sacrificed, not the human. The cat may have been attracted to the human initially, but there is never love between them. How can the death of the cat be considered a loving sacrifice? The way that this movie presents itself, cats are just vessels to be used by humans and discarded. For those reviewers that state that this movie is about a man who is turned into a cat, that is not correct: the poor cat is possessed by the spirit of a man and that spirit thinks and behaves like his human self throughout the possession. As a cat lover, I resented the treatment of the cats in this movie as mindless objects whose sole purpose was to correct bad human behavior; there was no regard for the cruel fate that they would have to face - no matter the outcome for the human possessing them. I'm sorry, but this is not the kind of film that could be written by or intended for people who love and admire cats.",negative
Nine Lives,"Why has this film been given such poor ratings? It is a lovely film, perfect for kids and adults alike. It is gentle, funny and charming. Visually it is a treat and the set designer deserves an award for producing such beautiful sets. Jennifer Garner never fails to charm and in this film and in this film she is perfectly matched with her little look alike daughter, Malina Weissman. Malina is perfectly cast and her future should be assured, based on her performance in this film. Cheryl Hines is very funny in her part of the ex-wife. Kevin Spacey is never my favorite actor, however he is perfectly cast as the self centered, uber successful business man, content to neglect his family. The film is funny with several laugh out loud moments. You don't have to be a cat lover to like the film but for those cat lovers out there you will recognize several famous cats. Overall it is a very enjoyable film. Go see it!",positive
Maggie's Plan,"New Yorker Maggie Hardin (Greta Gerwig) wants to have a baby. Her relationships never last more than six months except her college romance with best friend Tony (Bill Hader) but that doesn't count. She decides to get sperm from college acquaintance, pickle entrepreneur Guy Childers. She works at an art school with Tony's wife Felicia (Maya Rudolph) and John Harding (Ethan Hawke). Maggie and John meet over a paycheck mixup and start a relationship over a novel he's trying to write. He's unhappily married to Columbia professor Georgette (Julianne Moore) with two kids.The appeal of this movie depends a lot on one's appreciation of Gerwig's flighty, quirky persona. It's a rom-com where the romance is not the most likable. Harding starts off poorly and I never find him a good match for Maggie. Even the pickle guy is better although Tony could be the best if there is no Felicia. I'm actually glad at the turn in the second half of the movie and it becomes an anti-rom-com. The funniest relationship is between Maggie and Georgette. The movie could do with more of them together.",negative
Maggie's Plan,"Greta Gerwig as ""Maggie"" (an independent woman) bakes up a plan to become a single mother and in the process 'the plan' works but then backfires and puts her into a situation 'the plan' did not include - marriage.Gerwig gives a charming performance as Maggie steering a course through a relationship with a overly analytical writer once divorced husband, raising her three year old child, working her job as an instructor in a local college, and realizing her husband is still in love with his first wife! Maggie is in a pickle so she devises another plan!The setting is the New York City intellectual society living in row houses and meeting in cafe's to socialize. The cast includes Bill Hader, Ethan Hawke, Maya Rudolph, Julianne Moore, Wallace Shawn. This is a simple 'slice of life' type story about modern people looking for and finding happiness and direction in their life. It's probably a film more appreciated by a viewer that likes a romantic flavor in a story that looks into the feelings and emotion in the human spirit.This is a cheerful light story that includes just a touch of sorrow mixed into a picture of mostly happy people getting on with life. And don't forget the pickles!",positive
45 Years,"With nary a critical word to be found amongst the fawners in the film critics' pantheon, 45 Years has gone on to receive a surfeit of undeserved approbation in such places as Metacritic, with an unbelievable ""metascore"" of 94. My first reaction to this onslaught of film critic stupidity was simply to ask, ""How can this be?""45 Years may be infected with a simple case of being ""too British."" Now don't get me wrong‚ÄîI love quite a number of British films, which often prove superior to their American counterparts. But when a film ends up being ""too British,"" it often suffers from glacial pacing and a rather dry demeanor which 45 Years obviously suffers from throughout.But there are plenty of films featuring lugubrious plots with humorless characters that still remain compelling. What's needed of course is a plot that goes somewhere, and characters that manage to avoid being pejoratively labeled as ""sad sacks."" Unfortunately, 45 Years avoids none of this and more!It's all supposed to be about some kind of marital crisis that befalls an aging, childless couple by the name of Kate and Geoff Mercer who live in the flatlands of Norfolk, in eastern England. Kate and Geoff's idyllic existence is suddenly shattered when Geoff receives a letter that his ex-girlfriend Katya's body, lost in an Alpine hiking accident 50 years earlier, has been suddenly found perfectly preserved inside a glacier in the Swiss Alps.Andrew Haigh, the writer-director here, apparently was quite enamored with this gimmick of an inciting incident which he conscripted from a short story entitled Another Country. Haigh's idea is to show how Kate's perspective on the marriage changes after new information comes to light regarding Geoff's relationship with the ex-girlfriend.Geoff remains what he's been all along: a curmudgeon. He can't understand why Kate should be upset over a relationship he was involved in years ago. The revelation that Katya took his surname bothers Kate but not Geoff, who merely takes to smoking cigarettes to assuage the anxiety he's experiencing over Kate's growing dissatisfaction with him. Oh yes, he's a bit of a lefty too as it's revealed that he once called Kate's friend a ""fascist,"" during a political discussion that got out of hand. As for Kate, one wonders why she should be upset over something that happened fifty years earlier. It's mainly the principle of Geoff not being honest with her. But she appears to throw her principles out the window when she surreptitiously and underhandedly goes up to the attic and views some old slides of Katya, taken by Geoff right before the accident. There, (simmering with jealousy), she spies a close-up picture of Katya, visibly pregnant.While all this is going on, the couple is getting ready for their 45th wedding anniversary. Kate simply has to put on a good face while the couple is finally heralded by all their friends at the actual banquet. Kate's ""new perspective"" on her marriage is the ""big"" revelation that we're supposed to get excited about. The critics use big words to describe what is really a simple change in circumstances: ""devastating truth,"" a ""sensitive and devastating portrait of a long, happy marriage in sudden crisis,"" ""quietly moving and deceptively tragic,"" a story ""about whether secrets can be survived,"" ""two people haunted by a specter from another lifetime,"" ""deep reserves of inner torment."" You get the picture!Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay can do little with the material foisted upon them and the viewer only perks up when one or another nostalgic tune from the 60s pops up intermittently on the film's soundtrack.In the end, the critics would like you to believe that 45 Years represents the second coming of Ingmar Bergman. Nothing could be further than the truth. If your protagonists are deadly dull to begin with, and your inciting incident leads to the feeblest of epiphanies, then please explain to me what the critics' brouhaha is all about.",negative
45 Years,"A sequence of events in the run up to a big celebration of the couple's 45th anniversary. An unexpected letter with some unsettling news that pulls, just a little, at the seams of the marriage.Scenic English country side outside a historic market town. Accomplished performances by all of the cast. Charming British accents. Lovely camera work. Tight scripting & dialogs that brings out the affections and tensions of a long, childless marriage. All of this points to an engaging movie, and it is.Except, there isn't enough in it. It's like someone took the plot of a short story and decided to spin it out into a novel and you wish they hadn't. It's like a samosa where they skimped on the aloo. It is worth a watch, just about, especially on a day where you feel your life has been too dramatic and you want to tamp it down a little.",positive
Rams,"Just a week ago I saw 'F√∫si' which was about an overweight person with the mind of a child. And now another excellent Icelandic movie that centres on the livestock farmers. One of the best movie about the farmers I have seen. It is not all about their farms, but the love and dedication towards their work. About the art of raising animals that passed through the generations who never abandoned their ancestral village to look for a better life somewhere else. But what happens when suddenly a great threat pose to their way of life that they all only known. That's what this film talk about.This story is about two brothers Gummi and Kiddi, who have not spoken for decades. They live next door to one another in a remote village raising sheep. When one theirs ram wins a prestigious regional contest, that lead to discover a fear of scrapie epidemic, a disease that might wipe out their local breeds. After this incident, the conflict between the brothers escalates further. So what happens after the entire village lose their business to a viral infection brings a dramatic ending to the story.This is the advantage of watching world cinemas. You will get a chance to learn a different culture and other unfamiliar stuffs. Nowadays Hollywood is about big budget and superhero movies. Small scale films like this are very occasion, but I'm missing nothing through my love to films around the globe.I love realism films, but still this film gives a cinematic experience with the beautiful interior landscapes of Iceland. Most of the film takes place in the winter, but all the important outdoor sequences came prior to that season. Still the second half is the best part of the storytelling. After all Iceland without ice/snow is unimaginable.""If we've scrapie in the valley, we're screwed.""The story has a small twist in the halfway mark, that you could see it coming. But the third act was so awesome, because the pace picks up and brings the unexpected ending. Yet, I was little disappointed the way it concluded. I like the details, I don't always like understandable phrase in a film's ending. Those things are effective for the movies that going have a sequel. So what I meant is the end should have been a bit more specific about what actually happens. If it is about the brothers, not the livestock, then the theme is slightly misleading with all the developments.I was tempted to rate it close to maximum, like as I said the finale took away the fractions of my 'like' towards this wonderful drama. The lead actor from the 'Virgin Mountain' can be seen in a tiny role in a couple of scenes.I've heard the ram that acted in this called Garpur was credited, but it was not like any special performance. The movie was very slow, but I like this kind of narration when a story demands its own time to bring anything it wanted to tell on its own perfect way. There are scenes with some dark humours, so it is a semi tragicomedy.The initial parts, maybe the first act looks like an ordinary rural narration, but if you learn about the story and its character prior to your watch then you might feel comfortable with the pace. This film was sent to the recently concluded Oscars to represent Iceland, but failed to make into the ultimate round. Forget the American Academy Awards, this is still an excellent movie. I won't hesitate to suggest it to you all, it is a dull start, but you would feel worth watching it in the end.8/10",negative
Rams,"Rams is an Icelandic saga of the highest order, not of Kings, but of the Icelandic sheep farmer. There are battles, but the opponents are nature, the struggles of human relationship, and the hardships of life. It is a saga of and for the working man, expressed and pared down like a working man's haiku, and it is breathtaking. Beyond the story, it is a visual feast. The Icelandic landscape - seen in both its green glory and its stark white glory - literally made me gasp at first. The sound of the howling, relentless winter wind touched a primal nerve in me. And as someone who has co-existed with animals for much of my life, and who has worked on farms for years, I was touched by the aphorism that you can love - truly love - your animals, and then kill them and eat them. Killing something you love is not an easy thing to do of course, but Rams is a blast of reality in that way. Sustenance and survival in the real world, people. It's not always pretty, and never packaged. Rams is harshness and it is beauty, contrasting, colliding, and intermingling, like an Icelandic landscape and an Icelandic sheep farmer's life. Ten out of ten stars.",positive
Brigsby Bear,"5 minutes into this film and i thought it was a dull, quircky, offbeat comedy that i wouldn't resonate with. Half way through and i was laughing hard and really touched.
This is such a great film, it has been a while since i felt compelled to write such a review, but this film is just awesome.",negative
Brigsby Bear,"I know that tastes can't change overnight, but it's a shame that audiences can't gravitate more to movies like this. Films like this are very rare, due to the fact that they'll hardly ever snag a major release by a large studio. Not to compare the two, but last year's release of Swiss Army Man was so unique and weird that I ate it up, and I felt the exact same way about this year's Brigsby Bear, which could very well end up being my absolute favorite film of the year. Unique films are a breath of fresh air, but not all of them are great, because the stories themselves may not explore enough to truly warrant award recognition. Although Brigsby Bear won't be winning any major awards this season, here is why it's a wonderful piece of cinema in my eyes.From first-time feature film writer Kyle Mooney and direct time feature film director Dave McCary, Brigsby Bear follows James Pope, a young man with a backstory that I can't reveal throughout this review, who has only ever seen one television show, called Brigsby Bear. When there aren't any more episodes coming out, he sets out on a mission with a few others to finish the show themselves. Becoming a filmmaker, gaining new friends, and learning many moving and comedic life lessons, this is a story worth showcasing to a very large audience. Unique, weird, and powerful all at once, this movie is elevated by a wonderfully sincere and comedic performance by Kyle Mooney as the lead.It's very rare that a comedian can be simultaneously funny and dramatic at the same time, making it truly seem that this is a real-world scenario unfolding on-screen. Not only did this story feel authentic to me, but it touched me on a personal level in terms of how there would definitely be people like this if certain situations were to present themselves to the world. Mooney is an actor that I believe many people should keep an eye on. Sure, his YouTube career is where he started and he's most known for his role on Saturday Night Live, but he's one of those rare performers that I believe will break out and become very famous in years to come.I truly believe that this is a flawless film for the story it's trying to convey. No film is perfect, but a film can be done perfectly when looked at a certain way, and I believe film lovers and even filmmakers themselves will be the ones who love this film the most. Original ideas are slim to none throughout mainstream media nowadays, but I dare you to come up with a premise like this throughout the past ten years. Yes, there are always similarities in every story, but when a film can surprise you even in its first act, it's something special.In the end, Brigsby Bear is a perfect little indie film for fans of cinema, well-written, well-directed, calmly scored with care, and wrapped in a nice little bow of uniqueness. I found myself wanting to rewatch this movie the second it concluded. Although short and to the point at a mere 97 minutes, there are many hidden elements that will elevate the movie even more upon second and third viewings. I'm sure the fact that it's so weird will turn some audiences away from fully enjoying it, but like I said, hardcore film lovers and filmmakers of any kind are truly the ones that will most likely love Brigsby Bear. This is easily one of the best films I've seen all year.",positive
Parallels,"This movie is stupid. It is an insult to sci-fi fans, an insult to people who like comic books, art of any kind, intelligent conversation, good TV, decent movies, and anything ever created by human kind that had a modicum of talent or thought invested in it. Watch it only to scream at the inane characters. Watch it to roll your eyes at the banal plot points. Or do as I did, and laugh uncontrollably at the terrible dialogue. ""Says the mute,"" is the j'accuse of this film's invented universe, a universe best described as a schlocky tick-tocky time waste. You may not believe that man has evolved from apes, readers, but believe me when I tell you that we would all be better off picking fleas from each other's pelts than watching this film.*** Edit June 8, 2015*** A great sci-fi movie is difficult to create. I appreciate the people who try - even though I could not stand this piece.",negative
Parallels,"It's not perfect but it deserves my ten stars because I really want it to continue. In contrary to many other TV-series (I suppose this is a pilot of a series?) I think that ""Parallels"" must have been made by people that really like what they do. The main characters feels almost as Real People, not just actors doing their work. Of course this is not the Oscar league, please understand that I'm comparing to similar productions.The plot is far from novel: We have the involuntary protagonists, a phenomenon with a vessel that uses the phenomenon, a couple of persons with unknown objectives, and an abundance of different world settings. But the ingredients are well cooked into a delicious taste. This is a ""what if"" story with a thriller, not a ""it's like this"" with BangBoom in the lead.No mind-boggling stuff... Well, it would be if it happened to me, but as a watcher I'm carefully taken through the loops and I can forgive the few plot holes I noticed. The feeling I get is that this is made with intelligence, it has been given more than a half thought!And it has humor! Not much but just enough.When I left ""Fringe"" I felt sad for a long time. Now I'm happy again, I hope this new affair will continue!",positive
About Last Night,"This movie re-make was extremely disappointing. I'd been waiting to see this DVD for the last three months and I was really looking forward to it. I saw the '80s version with Demi Moore and Rob Lowe and I really enjoyed it. It is not a classic or even a cult film by any means, but it was entertaining and the acting was believable.This remake was horrible - the acting was flat with the exception of Regina Hall and even so, she was a little over the top as Joan. Kevin Hart was screechy (like Chris Tucker) and seemed to be doing a comedy stand-up routine throughout the movie rather than really getting into his character. Joy Bryant seemed to have phoned in her part and was by far the dullest character in the movie. The dog, Pacino, was more exciting than this Debbie. I've been a fan of Michael Ealy's for years, and I was taken by surprise that he didn't do more with his role. His relationship with Debbie was one-dimensional and there didn't seem to be any chemistry between Danny and Debbie at all. I didn't really care whether or not they got back together because it never seemed as if they had a relationship to begin with.",negative
About Last Night,"I attended a screening of the film a week prior to it opening in theaters. Will Packer, Kevin Hart and Regina Hall came to the theater to get viewers reactions that evening. ""About Last Night"" is the funniest, most realistic romantic comedy I've seen. However, be mindful of having a mouth full of beverage or food because Kevin Hart is hilarious in this movie and Regina Hall compliments him very well with her comedic acting. Both actors coming off of the heels of other recent successful movies (""Best Man Holiday"" for Hall and ""Ride Along"" for Hart) may make you assume that they gave their best performances already. But in my opinion, this was some of the best work I've seen from both actors. Michael Ealy is incredibly good to look at and a good actor as well, with a current TV show receiving good reviews and it's nice to see Joy Bryant on the big screen once again. Whether you're a couple or a single person, you will relate to these characters personally or know of someone in your life they remind you of. It doesn't matter what race you are either.

The Den,"This movie is by far one of the lamest and most unsatisfactory horror movies I've ever seen. Second only to Dark Skies. The end offers very little explanation and leaves the viewer with a lot of questions and more than a little frustrated. The plot takes twists and turns and ultimately turns around and goes backward leaving the conflict unresolved (kinda like Dark Skies). all of the characters are very static and have no progression including our main heroine. And not to mention most of the camera work (shot entirely through the cameras on the phones and computers) was a lot like Cloverfield what with all the running and screaming and the viewer can't really see anything unless she/he wants to end up with a migraine. I wish I hadn't wasted the seventy six minutes watching it, and my advice is that you go watch something interestingly thought provoking like The Tall Man.",negative
The Den,OMG those are my first words about this movie. I will first say I'm a Horror movie buff and I have seen more horror films then I can count and it is my favorite genre of films so with that said I will begin. I had first seen a trailer and heard about this movie a few months prior to it's release and I couldn't wait to watch it just based on the premise. I love found footage movies.I will say that I didn't know any of the actors nor was I worried bc that doesn't always make a great horror film as this shows. The actors did a terrific job especially the main girl Elizabeth. I will say that for a short film it was Uber intense and very much kept you on the edge of your seat. The violence was gritty and in your face and the questions it raises are very valid especially from a technology standpoint. I for one don't scare easy at all and the jump scares were the best I have seen in a while and even knowing they were coming and it still got me was Impressive.I would recommend this movie to any and all that love horror and appreciate what this film does in the time span it is allotted. I would also note that the movie does raise one or two questions but nothing that would kill the movie buzz once the credits start rolling. I for one hope this director keeps up with his career bc as I said I love this movie and it is def going in the books for direction as well as great scares and overall atmosphere.,positive
The Hallow,"About as scary as a field full of bunnies playing with skipping ropes and singing Gangnam Style (actually that is kind of scary), debut director Corin Hardy's Irish horror The Hallow certainly has an initially intriguing idea that very quickly within its short (yet somehow looooong) run time peters out into a downright laughable horror fable that is far too daft and po-faced for its own good.After a nice set up of 10 ‚Äì 15 minutes or so of creepy forest scenery, nasty looking black goo and an unfortunate deer, everything seems to be relatively on track for The Hallow but within a quick-fire succession of angry locals who are upset about work being done in their woodlands and warn of evil pixies, fairies or who even cares, laugh out loud road side attacks and some bizarre and extended home invasion attempts, The Hallow loses all hopes of ever becoming a successful horror genre entry in an abundance of daft and overwrought ideas and conceptions.Centring his unbelievable and far from terror inducing plot around new parents Adam and Clare played un-charismatically by Jospeh Mawle and Australia's own Bojana Novakovic respectively, The Hallow neither has the characters we care for, a plot that stands up on inspection (overall this film seems to take place over an incredibly long night) or the nasties to make us shiver and even though some of the CGI and makeup effects of the woodland ghouls and gremlins do look somewhat nefarious, on close inspection there's just nothing in The Hallow that makes it either scary, interesting or on any real level engaging, stopping any chance Hardy's film had of making an impact.Winning praise from certain critic circles and even winning the odd award, The Hallow seemingly struck a chord with selective audiences around the world and Hardy's name has cropped up in recent times as a director to keep a close eye on but for me and perhaps many others, The Hallow is a diabolically bad attempt at crafting an under your skin horror experience and a genuinely bad movie regardless of genres.¬Ω an unhelpful farmer out of 5",negative
The Hallow,"The Hallow or The Woods as it is otherwise known is a UK/Irish collaboration. Its by no means a mainstream horror flick, yet, in spite of its humble credentials, its actually not half bad. The scares in The Hallow come on on quite early and linger till ""after"" the closing credits. This should make the impatient viewer quite happy. There is a nominal amount of ratcheting up the tension in this film which is followed by an abundance of reasonably well executed creature scares. The creatures themselves tap into a supposedly Irish mythology about spirits and fairy like creatures that ""assimilate"" those who violate their forest haven. There's a lot to like here. The setting is suitably creepy, the premise is well established and convincing. What's also refreshing is the couples very sane reaction when confronted with the creatures, that is, to run like hell. Perhaps the only downside to this film, I felt, was its early introduction of the monsters. I believe this film would have been more effective with a more gradual application of tension and maybe another ten-fifteen minutes run time. That said, The Hallow still hits all the right horror buttons and does so in a convincing and creative manner. Eight out of ten from me.",positive
A Long Way Down,"Review: I quite enjoyed this witty drama which has something for everyone. On one side it's a deep drama because the 4 characters all have there own reasons to commit suicide but on the other side it's a enjoyable comedy because they all end up coming together and help each other through there individual problems. The fact they the 4 different characters end up on the roof on New Years Eve at exactly the same time was a bit weird, but each actor was very realistic and they really showed emotion. The chemistry between the characters was great and the director put the storyline together well but I do think that the movie could have been a bit better if there was a bit more depth to Pierce Brosnan's character. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Since Pierce Brosnan has hanged up his Bond suit, he has starred in a wide range of movies which. From singing in Mamma Mia, which was a total shock, to The Matador and Seraphim Falls, he has proved that he hasn't become type casted like many other actors in Hollywood. Aaron Paul comes fresh from Breaking Bad and has starred in Need For Speed which also stars Imogen Poots as his love interest. His acting style is very limited but it works in the roles that he has picked since Breaking Bad. Hopefully he will flourish in his next roles. Toni Collette is one of those actors that can take on any role that gets put in front of her. After her famous role in Muriel's Wedding, she has gone from strength to strength and I can't see this role damaging her career because she had the most emotional storyline to deal with. Basically, all of the actors put in a great performance and it was great to see Sam Neill back on the big screen.Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $7millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there emotional comedic dramas about 4 individuals who have there own reason to commit suicide. 6/10",negative
A Long Way Down,"This film was the most touching one I have seen in a very long time. The ratings just don't do it justice, the story line is amazing and the actors are even better, all the characters were brought to life. Everything that happened made you feel connected to the characters and they won't leave your hearts any time soon. It highlights some of the struggles that many people have to go through in society now and shows what happens when people are thrown into the spotlight. You feel a range of emotions, from being sad to happy, scared to joyous. I really enjoyed this and will be watching it many more times in the future. I would definitely recommend watching this, you'll love it.",positive
Ashby,"This might have been a mediocre movie. I knew someone who was a military sniper. His guilt over what he had done overcame him, and he committed suicide. There isis a meaningful story here that could have meant something.But how stupid can a producer, writer, or director be to put an MRI in the basement of a family home? It boggles the mind how stupid that is. A magnetic resonance imaging machine (MRI) will attract any metal to it while it is operating. That includes wrenches, bicycles, zippers on jeans, metal snaps on varsity jackets, etc.I have a friend who has metal fragments in his neck. He can't have an MRI because the machine would literally put the fragments out of his neck and possibly kill him. That's how powerful an MRI is. This whole MRI thing is just stupid, stupid, stupid.",negative
Ashby,"For those out there who seek out to destroy every piece of art. This is a movie about friendship, respect and love. This is a story about facing yourself in the mirror.

Although the depth of the characters is left shallow, the storyline is well done. If you are going to watch a movie anyway, then watch this one. Because this movie will teach you a thing or two; about life and everything that comes with it.We liked it personally because of the message is tries to convey while courage, love, friendship and family are at the front of this epic movie.",positive
Stranger by the Lake,"First let me clarify. This movie has a lot of simulated homosexual sex but only a couple of brief scenes could be consider real and are not that strong.I am male and not gay so for me was easier to see BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR (L' Vie the Adele) than confronting with a movie about male cruising but after the unanimous word of mouth about this movie I took the risk and I am happy I did.The movie is pretty simple. One big lake, a wood and a parking lot. The pace is deliberately slow but pretty involving. In certain moments the suspense reach Hitchcock levels.The story is quite simple too. Just the necessary twists to create a particular situation. In a ""cruising environment"" near a lake Franck see his object of desire possibly commit ting a crime and basically lies to the police in order to cover it.What really matters are the very few characters in that environment and their interactions.In the same way BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR was better told from a woman perspective; this tale is perfectly suited for men. Both are great movies; put aside prejudices and see both.",negative
Stranger by the Lake,"This movie made me very nervous - a lot of male sex and nudity out in the open, on the beach, and with no protection. No sunscreen. At all. Shocking! (haven't the French ever heard of skin cancer?)While it sometimes verges into Serious Movie territory, breaking sexual taboos in a very realistic and honest way, too much of the film is just silly and arbitrary. The randomness of actions among the characters seemed guided more by the writer's keyboard than by actual human behavior. Which is a shame because so many of the film's elements: acting, direction, music, editing et al. are is so first-rate, and many of the scenes on their own feel so emotionally authentic.But in a world where anything can happen for no apparent reason, nothing carries any import. And then one's mind is free to contemplate the clumsiness of the film's obvious symbolism and how uncomfortable it must have been for the actors to have to sit on that rocky lakeshore bare-assed.And eventually, it all just spirals out of control. Which made me feel sad, but for all the wrong reasons.",positive
Metallica Through the Never,"This movie made me want to set myself on fire and run flailing into an angry mob of baseball equipped, bike-less bikers.I just waded through a sea of reviews praising this 'masterpiece' and time after time was brought to tears with laughter. This isn't a movie! It may have been a good concert if Lars was replaced with the phonics monkey from South Park and James started drinking again. The timing in all the songs were so interchangeable that one would think it was a documented case of rhythm perceived by a person with half a brain. The concert was not one of their greatest and I get that not every concert is going to be great but this was the one they put their stupid movie to. Well... Maybe calling it a movie is a bit too much. I've read in reviews that people shouldn't bad-mouth it for it's content and watch it like you would a concert... No. Watch a concert like you would a concert. They released this as a movie, with a movie trailer and everything, then they lazily put badly written scenes from a story with absolutely no direction in between songs. Yeah I'm done writing this sh!tty review. The movie was sh!t but it was at least hilarious. Download it, watch it, laugh or cry. Warm gooey pen!s butter in your eye.",negative
Metallica Through the Never,"Metallica does it again! These guys always know how to raise the bar for every other metal band out there. IMAX 3D is the way to go! Almost everyone was amped in the theater and we were all pretty much rocking in our seat and singing along. We were even clapping like it was an actual concert! Metallica provided total energy throughout the film. It was 70% concert (like you were on stage with them), 25% action movie, and 5% music video! Anyway, they did not skimp on the effects or the sound! I'm not sure what ssp113 was talking about when he/she stated that the resolution was awful. It was the coolest and clearest thing ever!

The crimes against comedy (let alone humanity) is first-time (and hopefully LAST time) filmmaker Jeff Baena who wouldn't recognize a fart from an ad-lib in his tone-deaf attempt at satire, dark comedy or sharp skewer to cul-de-sac audiences he's so desperately catering to while completely wasting his vast amount of talent acquired (squandering so much comedic casting is unbearably sad).

Singularity,"This film is so bad I can't even be bothered stringing how much I hate this film into cogent sentences.So, 97 years after the bots take over you're telling me that the windows on the shops are crystal clean? You're telling me that despite no new clothes being manufactured the human characters look like they've just got a whole new wardrobe from GAP? That nearly 100 years of neglect has seen no collapsed roofs, no weeds growing from gutters, and fields that look like they've been fallow for a couple of years? That street signs, railings, window shutters, metal roll shutters have absolutely no signs of rust? That despite the bot driven apocalypse, the main female lead still has time to obviously dye her hair? In the scenes running through forests, they follow well worn and undergrowth free paths.... worn and maintained by whom exactly? Bots? In one of the opening scenes, a shop is engulfed in ivy inside yet in one of the later scenes, a house described as 'really old' has perfectly white whitewashed walls, and inside looks pristine - photographs aren't faded, glass cabinets haven't a speck of dust on them... in fact there is no dust, not even a cob web! And given that the house hasn't been heated for 97 years, it's amazing that there is no damp whatsoever. 97 year old Polaroid film works and, it must be energizer, because the batteries are still fresh. Despite being out in the wilds for days on end the male lead is always perfectly cleanly shaven. Even when he is woken from sleep he has been mysteriously shaved - then again he is a robot - a fact that the writers are at pains to have us aware of from the outset with the laboured 'no food for me' scene - funny then that when the girl falls asleep on his chest she doesn't notice that he doesn't need to breathe (we presume) And then, when they meet some nasty humans, they are all covered in stubble, dirt and worn clothes - oh my, so original.The male lead gets tied up in a brand spanking new rope. I mean, this thing clearly was just bought from a shop on the day... and the rope magically moves from one scene to the next... did they take lunch in the middle of shooting the 'tied up in brand new rope' scenes? Maybe they should have...The male lead is only capable of two expressions - eyes normal and eyes bursting out of his head. There is nothing in between and the rest of his face is entirely pointless. Lucky for him that the dialogue doesn't require much else. Actually, I'm not giving him credit... he can do a variation on these two expressions above including with mouth open and with mouth shut.The female lead should take urgent note that crying involves water coming from the eyes. You can't snivel and gasp for air, and then expect to look authentic with a perfectly dry face. Special effects are dire - in the opening scenes burning buildings look like someone went mad with the Photoshop clone tool. Explosions don't cast any light on objects that are close by and clouds of dense smoke don't cast any shadows and dissipate in moments leaving no trace. Enormous bots appear to defy the laws of physics and move through dense forestry without causing a single tree to move. 'Whats in your chest' scene - great work on the 97 year old straw bales that look to have been made in the last week... and the plentiful fresh straw on the ground in the barn... just lazy... Lighting.... I mean really.... what is happening with the lighting? In a dark and dingy forest, and it looks like two blazing follow spots behind the cameras.... just cheap and nasty.The characters are so poorly developed that their behaviour is schizophrenic at best.Continuity is a joke - in the opening scenes we see buildings burnt to to the ground, yet in later scenes, and I mean 97 years later scenes, they are visible in the background, with lights on inside. Really, 97 years after the rise of the bots, they are still using lights? Who is changing the bulbs? Bot janitor? Who even makes the bulbs?The bots themselves. If you're looking for humans, perhaps IR might be better than visible light to detect them? I think it's utterly lazy that the main feature of the film, that drives the whole storyline, the bots, are so poor.After leaving the 'facility' (you just know that's what they call it), they walk through a field of corn ready to be harvested. I'm feeling like a stuck record here...John Cusack must have been desperate for the cash.",negative

I'm sure it could be done much better with minor changes to scenario and at least some effort!

To hurt them.",positive
Last Shift,"I have to give credit to Juliana Harkavy because if not for her convincing performance, I would not have been able to finish this heap of garbage. Last Shift follows an officer covering the final overnight shift of a police station that's closing down. It's one of those isolated, creepy slow burn movies that can get under your skin. At least, that's what it could have been. What Last Shift lacks most is subtlety. There are jump scares *everywhere*. There's one sequence where it's just ""boo!"" after ""jump!"" after ""ahh!"" and it's just f*cking annoying after a while because none of it works. This wouldn't be such an issue if the story was relatable but it's not. The creepy cult angle has been done a million times before. Last Shift also features every haunting trope in existence - doors slamming, dead people hallucinations, whispering, singing - it's freaking exhausting. The way the story is told is even worse. They introduce characters solely for the purpose of exposition. Instead of trying to push the narrative forward with some character development or any semblance of humanity, these characters just say exactly what's going on and then leave. Nothing is left to the imagination. The movie plays its hand right off the top and forces us down this rabbit hole of insanity and stupidity for an hour and a half. Another thing is the protagonist isn't relatable. Harkavy gave a fine performance given the material but her character is a dumbass. She should've hauled ass out of there twenty minutes into the movie but no, staying and protecting this abandoned sh*thole of a police station is more important than keeping her sanity. Yeah, no. There's nothing salvageable here. The subject matter is inherently disturbing but it's exploitation in its purist form. It doesn't go into the psychology of cults or having a family member tied to a heinous crime. It's just like, hey, sh*t happens. Surface level scares that don't even scratch the surface. After a while of bashing you over the head with jump scares you're so desensitized to everything it becomes a waiting game for the movie to end. I guess Last Shift succeeds as an exercise in patience - how long can you sit through every poorly constructed horror clich√© known to man? I recommend skipping this shift, even if it means losing the job. Whatever they're paying, it's not worth this.",negative
Last Shift,"Others might not think the movie is as good as i'm saying it is, but this is my opinion. The movie actually scared me, which is something that doesn't happen often with horror movies. It didn't need to be a generic slasher film in order to induce fear. It delved deep into psychological fear, which is what I like. Not many movies can successfully do what this movie did. The story itself interested me, and during every twist in the storyline, I was on the edge of my seat. Yes, there were jumpscares, but not predictable ones. Sure, here and there there would be some weird scenes, or scenes that I felt the movie didn't really need, but the fact that they made something out of nothing and actually made it good, makes me think it deserves a 10 out of 10 rating.",positive
Life of Crime,"Review: I found it really hard to get into this film because the storyline was weak and extremely unrealistic. The movie is based around a couple of guys who kidnap a rich man's wife in order to get a million dollars for her release. Not the most unique idea for a film! Anyway, I was expecting it to be witty, judging by the cast, but it was more silly than amusing. Mos Def and John Hawkes come up with the dumbest of plans, which was just not that well thought through. When there plan starts to go downhill, there terrible criminal minds come up with another sketchy plan to get themselves out of the mess they made. The storyline goes from one extreme to another and it doesn't help that they have a Nazi loving criminal to help them, who also has personal issues. Basically, the movie wasn't funny or interesting but I did stick with the film, just to see what these dumb criminals were going to do next. Average!¬†Round-Up: Judging by the unsuccessful box office takings, I'm not alone with thinking that this film was a total waste of a good cast. Its not often that Jennifer Aniston makes ""Straight To DVD"" movies, but after watching this film, it's not surprising that it flopped. All of the actors try and make the most out of a terrible storyline, but there performances isn't enough to save the film. On the plus side, I did like the ending when characters decide to flip the script and kidnap someone else but it doesn't really go anywhere. I didn't get how someone could go missing for a week without anyone suspecting anything and there was some other sketchy moments that I don't want to mention because I don't want to spoil the film for people who haven't watched it. At the end of the day, it could have been much better if the storyline was thought through properly and if the actual plan made any sense.Budget: $12million Worldwide Gross: $1.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedy/crime movies about a couple of down and outs, who plan to kidnap a rich man's wife for a million dollar ransom. 3/10",negative

Jenny's Wedding,"Jenny's Wedding, for the most part, has been discarded and labelled below average amongst most film critics and the public, therefore I began watching this film with preconceived ideas. Films consisting of gay female relationships are sparse, and ones that are watchable are even rarer, however this happened to fall into both categories. The problem arises when viewers deem the focus of this film to be something different to what it is, many people comment on the lack of chemistry between Heigl and Bledel, whereas upon watching the film it is clear the lack of screen time they actually had together played a part in that, and the film is less about their relationship as such, and much more focused on Heigl's family and their relationships with each other and Jenny respectively. Needless to say it was a sweet, feel-good film that; of course, has a plot which has been done many times before, but still kept me watching until the end.",negative
Jenny's Wedding,"Jenny's Wedding is an under-appreciated film that I think will surprise many of you. It is one of many fine quality films that I find myself asking: Why didn't this get more than just an extremely shallow limited release? It certainly deserved better than only grossing a paltry $6244 worldwide, especially considering the end product.Piloted by veteran screenwriter-director Mary Agnes Donaghue (Beaches, White Oleander), the movie starts with a well written script. It is bolstered by fine performances across the board from a talented cast that includes Katherine Heigl, Tom Wilkinson, Linda Edmund, Grace Gummer and Alexis Beidel. It's crew achieved high production values that would compare favorably with films 5 times their budget. It has all the ingredients to be a fine film and delivers on that promise.Jenny's Wedding problem lies in Hollywood's inability to label it and know how to sell it rather than the film itself. It never meets the expectations unfairly placed on it by others to be a film it never pretended to be. It never was intended to be a laugh a minute comedy or a sappy love story or even a bold message film. It is an honest portrayal of how family members when placed in unfamiliar waters, may surprise or disappoint, themselves and others in how they act.I think this film benefits greatly from being seen with out any expectations. I had the benefit of watching this film without seeing the trailer or reading the blurb, both which reveal too much about the story. I enjoyed how the story unfolded, the slightly surprising but not shocking plot twist, and the unpredictability of how family members act and react when conflict arises. It had a credible balance of painful and feel good moments that any normal family goes through. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Jenny's Wedding and hope you will too.",positive
The Darkness,"I am Din√© (Navajo) and I am giving this movie one star because the acting was good. But the story line is way off.

Kill Command,"Mind the spoiler alert.So we have a group of soldiers send to a training island to test their skills against their replacements aka droids. Because there is an excessive amount of data being learned by the droids the tech girl who designed and programmed them is send along with them to asses the product.They easily take out some old versions and think they're done. All the wile outwards communication is being blocked but they don't seem to mind that and just stand around a lot. Don't get me wrong the movie is quite decent, way better than most of the other ""low budget"" sci-fi creations.Anyhow here are a few things I didn't like about the movie. The girl/creator is way to silent. Even when it's abundantly clear something is wrong she still keeps quiet wile all the information they can get would have been helpful. Mayor annoyance.At some point they walk into the storage facility for the droids not activated at that time. Did they turn this into an advantage, NO! They could have destroyed them as all of them are equipped with a self-destruct EMP bomb to prevent their tech from falling into enemy hands.Or better jet as the creator is there with them she could have disconnected them from the network and given them a command to protect the humans. Did I mention she has a chip in her head/neck that gives her the ability to interact with those droids through a neural interface. So something like that really shouldn't have been hard to do and would have made it a much more realistic final battle if you have a good portion of the enemy taken out and then some left to battle by human hands.For some reason 1 of the droids is the boss. Even though they're networked and at some point 3 of the same boss type droids are activated. Anyway they salvage an EMP bomb from one of the destroyed droids somehow up it's power (don't ask how) and manage to take the boss out. Sacrificing herself as her chip gets affected too. But guess what that thing made to take out the tech to prevent it from falling into enemy hands doesn't work the boss gets up again and now goes after the creator who plays dead and then blasts a hole though it's head. Then her chip gives out completely and she dies. Guess what happens next, the darn boss droid gets up again and manages with his last ""breath"" to upload itself into her destroyed chip!? So quite a bit of ridiculousness at the end and if that wasn't bad enough it also leaves an open ending. No one likes those, hell personally that's for a large part why I don't watch horror flicks anymore as they nearly always end without an end.",negative
Kill Command,"I wasn't expecting too much from ""Kill Command"" when I stumbled upon it on Netflix, expecting it to be your typical run of the mill low budget sci fi actioner. Well, I will admit that the movie did exceed my expectations, albeit in one area. That area being the look of the movie. The movie is well photographed, and the other production values are top notch, particularly the special effects depicting the homicidal robots the protagonists have to fight off.So what's the problem? Well, although the movie looks good, it does not give the viewer the feeling a movie like this needs to give. For starters, the movie is quite slow, particularly in the first thirty minutes. Although the movie picks up the pace slightly after that point, the movie makes a serious stumble with the action sequences that then unfold. The action simply isn't that involving. It feels routine at best, and you never feel the protagonists' peril or panic. Add in a far too long running time (100 minutes), the viewing experience ends up being somewhat of a lengthy slog.",positive
Turbo Kid,"Let's make a movie about the future, but set it in the past and make it look like it was set even further in the past. That could've been the pitch for ""Turbo Kid"" (NR, 1:33) ‚Äì and that's just one of many interesting and unusual things that there are to learn about this film even before discussing what it's about. For one thing, it's a co-production of Canada and New Zealand. Since it's technically a foreign film, it has no MPAA rating (but if it did, it would surely be rated ""R""). The movie has three directors, Fran√ßois Simard, Anouk Whissell and Yoann-Karl Whissell, all three of which also share credit for the screenplay, and all appear in the movie in small roles. What's more, the cinematographer, Jean-Philippe Bernier, is also one of the two people who did the film's score, which is a highly unusual combination of jobs. Now, let's get back to that highly unusual pitch summary in the first sentence of this paragraph.""Turbo Kid"" is a post-apocalyptic action movie set in the ""future"" year of 1997. That actually makes sense when you know that the film intentionally looks and sounds like it was made in the early 1980s. Stating it another way, this movie is ""retro futuristic"". It's a lot like many of the movies made in the late 70s and early 80s. In fact, the year picked for the story's setting, 1997, is the same year in which 1981's classic dystopian action thriller ""Escape from New York"" takes place. And that's not the only connection between other movies of this film's sub-genre. There are passing verbal references and visuals that are subtle shout-outs to movies like ""Soylent Green"" and ""The Terminator"". What's not so subtle is the strong and obvious influence of another post-apocalyptic film series from the 1980s (rebooted in 2015) on the plot, setting and costumes in this movie. As ""Wired"" magazine said, it's ""'Mad Max' on a BMX"".Munro Chambers plays a character simply called ""The Kid"", an orphaned teen just trying to survive in a land laid waste by¬Ö something (?) which led to the end of civilized society. The Kid scavenges items that he can ""sell"" to his world's version of a pawn broker (Romano Ozari) for that most precious of commodities ‚Äì water. The water that exists is under the control of a sadistic general called Zeus (Michael Ironside). As he brags to his ""minions"" (NOT the cute kind), he not only provides their liquid sustenance, but their entertainment as well. He sponsors regular violent and bloody gladiatorial-like contests between his ""henchmen"" (better word) and those unfortunate enough to have double-crossed Zeus¬Ö or just crossed his path.When he's not scavenging, The Kid is obsessing over his favorite superhero, someone called ""Turbo Rider"". The Kid has various Turbo Rider memorabilia in his house and then gets a hold of an old Turbo Rider comic book, which he seems to value almost as much as staying hydrated. As he's sitting in an old playground reading his comic book aloud to himself, he's approached by a girl named Apple (played by Canadian actress Laurence Leboeuf) who wants to be friends. She's impossibly chipper (either gratingly or adorably, depending on your point of view) and she may or may not be a cold-blooded killer. But she insists on hanging out with The Kid, and, well, friends are hard to come by in this terrible future-past (or is it past-future?), so he lets her tag along as he scavenges.As dangerous as this time and place is, you have to be tough to survive. The Kid teaches Apple his rules for survival and soon the two of them meet someone even tougher than The Kid ‚Äì a cowboy type named Frederic (Aaron Jeffery) who's an arm-wrestling champion and the closest thing that the few decent people left alive have to a protector. That is, until The Kid becomes Turbo Kid. He finds a costume that makes him look and feel like his hero, Turbo Man. The costume doesn't help him fly or anything, but it does have a pretty serious weapon built into one of the arms. The Kid becomes Turbo Kid just in the nick of time. For different reasons, Apple and Frederic both run afoul of Zeus and they need some serious turbo-charged rescuing! But even if Turbo Kid can free his only two friends from the clutches of Zeus, he'd likely be pretty ticked off and would probably want to hunt them down and, you know, kill them all.It's kind of a tough thing to judge this movie. On the one hand, it is very effective at evoking the feeling of cheesy early-80s future schlock. On the other hand, the violence (albeit comic violence) can be a bit excessive ‚Äì unless you find dismemberment and gallons of fake blood shooting everywhere to be amusing. Still, the graphic destruction of so many human bodies notwithstanding, this movie deserves credit for being very different from any other 2015 release and it is more entertaining than not. All this comes out to a mild recommendation ‚Äì with a strong warning. Considering all the blood and guts, a kids' movie this is not, but adults (especially those who like the cheesier movies of the 70s and 80s, and enjoy a good splatter flick) may find seeing ""Turbo Kid"" to be a blast. This B-movie gets¬Ö a ""B"".",negative
Turbo Kid,"If your primary movie-going experience is watching Hollywood blockbusters with vin diesel, this may not be your cup of tea, but for everyone else, this film destroys it.This film is pure gold, 80's indulgent, brain melting gore, a love story, and even somewhat artistic at times.I won't drone on, but this film i destined to be a staple in horror/art house/comedy cinema.It is fast-paced, adorable, hilarious, brutal, and has a charm that only filmmakers in love with their genres can produce. This is not Hollywood, but you wouldn't know it.

Just wished it lasted longer, and the ending was quite sudden.",negative

The Fury of a Patient Man,"Generally two things happen in a compelling revenge film. First we feel the agony that the character went through, and we can't wait for them to exact their revenge. Then when the character actually goes through with their plan of revenge, we get a sense of satisfaction, when at least some justice is served. This film is a BIG swing and miss on both.The pacing is very slow throughout the entirety of the film. The silver lining is that it is only an hour and a half. And I didn't waste anymore time on what was pure boredom watching this.",negative
The Fury of a Patient Man,"Kept me on the edge. Tense and well acted. I love Spanish cinema, hardly ever disappoints. Recommend to watch.",positive
The Machine,"The Machine is a rather successful attempt at implementing hard science fiction tendencies with a cyberpunk aesthetic. It may not be particularly adroit in terms of human and AI relationships, but I appreciate the rigor of the scientific explanation for the artificial intelligence. The film really excels at this in the beginning when Vincent conducts his own Turing tests as part of a secret headhunting operation. Then as he meets Ava things start taking a problematic turn. The military-industrial complex is invoked, but its purpose is sort of shadowy and never is contextualized in a way that would make the narrative more coherent.The questioning of human identity is the strongest point of the film, but I suppose that, at the very core, this film was more interested in being a thriller, rather than an exploration of the philosophical concepts.",negative
The Machine,"I actually enjoyed this film more than I thought I would, although the first half-hour didn't really work on me. I could see the low-budget in the initial shots. Because of this, I wasn't fully paying attention. However, I kept finding that I needed to keep rewinding to check out what I missed since the plot was actually moving along quite fast.Then at about the half-hour point, this movie really captured and kept my attention throughout. I really like the acting and the way the lead actress moved (including her dance and combat movements).As for scenes, the interior shots were set up well. The dark lighting was really effective and the eye glows worked very well. Editing was actually pretty quick and the story was compelling. I was actually concerned for the characters (which doesn't seem to happen for me very often in movies today).One of the real standouts is the visual effects work. It's phenomenal (especially considering the low budget). The intro credits look fantastic, the robot-creation sequence is just amazing, and the glow effect on the robot was pretty phenomenal. I have a feeling that the VFX teams did some serious overtime on this one. I also suspect the effects houses didn't make much on this production although I suspect the shots they did will make great portfolio material.If I had a qualm with this movie, it's the soundtrack. On one hand, it uses very cool CS80 sounds, similar to Blade Runner. Unfortunately the shots that used this instrument didn't have the 'weight' to warrant that sound. Believe me, I love that synth, but it needs to be used strategically. Then there's the other style of music which is typical of movies like Her or Ex Machina. I didn't think that score worked particularly well either. Perhaps something in-between the two styles would have worked better. The Blade Runner style was more mysterious and haunting than this film's presentation and the more modern score was too light and nondescript for the shots it was attached to. Regardless, there were sections of music that did work nicely. I seem to recall the music near the end of the film being spot-on.In general, this is a film that I can recommend to people who like science fiction and the topic of A.I., androids, cyborgs, etc.... It's actually quite a thoughtful film. Interestingly, I found that I prefer this movie over both Her and Ex Machina.",positive
Julieta,"What happened to Almodovar. He used to be controversial, with great humor, provoking thoughts and sending the audience on a roller-coaster ride. And now this, a subtle indication of a daughter with mother issues and underlined homosexual tones, but no surprises really in store, a subtle story, but the subtlety never becomes anything but subtle and with no major impact - a half-hearted effort.This was a far cry from his master pieces like Talk to her, Volver and The skin I live in. Almost a waste of time, except for the nice landscapes and decent cinematography, I cannot believe he actually won best director for that movie, a shadow of his former self!",negative
Julieta,"This Palme d'Or contestant does not reflect Almodovar's penchant for gender-bending, or his often convoluted scripts. However, it retains his female-centric theme. As ""Julieta"" is very much event-driven, I shall take the liberty of giving it chapter titles. The prologue shows Julieta on the verge of cleansing any thought of her daughter Antia who has gone missing for over a decade. Then she bumps into Antia's teenage-days buddy Beatrice who has in turn recently bumped into Antia, now a mother of three. This triggers Julieta's writing letters to her missing daughter (with nowhere to send) to tell her things she had not been told before. The main body of the movie is flashbacks based on these letters.1. STRANGERS ON THE TRAIN. Julieta is seventeen. The first stranger is a middle-age man who tries to strike up a conversation, which turns her away. The second is young fisherman Xoan she encounters in the dining car, reminding you of Celine and Jessie. But circumstances are different as Xoan has a wife who is in a coma. There is distinct Hitchcockian mood here when the train comes to an abrupt halt. Despite the engineer's categorical denial, the train did hit something. When it turns out that it is the successful suicide attempt of the middle-age man, Julieta suffers a sudden pang of guilt while Xoan comforts her. They end up making love on the train.2. DOMESTICITY BLISS. A few months later, a letter from Xoan announcing his wife's demise brings Julieta to his village, when she has news for him too: she is pregnant. Antia is born healthy and beautiful.3. MOTHER'S HELPER. In a side-plot, Julieta brings Antia on a short trip to visit her parents (father just retired and mother an invalid). Turns out that the old couple has hired a young and attractive live-in helper who, in addition to taking care of her mother, also takes care of her father, in a different way. But since Julieta has her own life, in a different city, there isn't much she can do.4. UNDERCURRENTS. There are two characters with significance surrounding Xoan. Marian is the dominating matron-type part-time helper who for obvious reasons display immediate hostility towards Julieta. On the other hand, Ava, a sculpture artist, Xoan's long-time friend, is genuinely friendly. When Julieta eventually fires Marian, the latter intimates, through innuendos, that Ava is Xoan's ex-lover and the two still have rendezvous occasionally.5. TRAGEDY HITS. During a 3-week period when teenage Antia is at camp, Julieta confronts Xoan about Ava, which may or may not be the reason he seeks refuge on a fishing trip, gets caught in a sudden storm and drowns. In the meantime, Antia at camp meets Beatrice (who appeared in the prologue) and the pair becomes instantly inseparable. This ended up with Antia going to spend some time at Beatrice's affluent house immediately after camp, necessitating Julieta's going there to announce the tragic news of her father's untimely death.6. WIDOWED. Mother and daughter move to an apartment and continue their life without a man-in-the-house as Julieta accepts another undesirable reality that she has to share her daughter's affection with Beatrice. After high school, however, Beatrice seeks her career in New York while Antia goes to a secluded retreat for three months as in interlude before university.7. DISAPPEARANCE. Julieta drives all the way to pick up Antia, only to be told that her daughter does not want to see her and has gone on to seek her own fulfillment. She lives through hell for a few years, hearing only once from Antia, a blank birthday card on the latter's own birthday.8. TYING UP LOOSE ENDS. Upon visiting Ava (Multiple Sclerosis) Julieta finds more clue about Antia's leaving, but nothing conclusive. More importantly, she meets Ava's friend Lorenzo, and the two ended up ""giving a reason for each other's existence"". This brings the timeline backs to the opening prologue when Julieta bumps into Beatrice. That happens again some time later, with more revelation from Beatrice. The conclusion comes as a letter from Antia with nothing that can really be called a twist.I may have used up all the allowed space and this turns out to be sort of a synopsis. So very quickly: great acting, good story-telling, engaging scenes ‚Äì a somewhat different Almodovar, but still quite recognizable.",positive
A Dark Song,"watched this movie after reading all the reviews here, hoping it was a hidden gem, disappointed and lost some credit points from my family as it was my choice. its a long winded film, bordering on some gross and disgusting scenes at times, with nothing to amount to it in the end.if you want real horror, stay away, watch if you want a good nap on a Saturday afternoon after lunch, works better than any sleeping pills. i give it a 2, because I'm not that mean.",negative
A Dark Song,"It makes such a change to get a supernatural movie that makes the viewer use their imagination, rather than bombarding them with CGI and men in rubber suits. This is a study of the old chestnut, 'Be careful what you wish for'. A young mother whose son had been murdered, seeks revenge on his killers via a magic ritual invoking angels. It's clearly influenced by the ""Bornless Ritual"", an invocation used by Aleister Crowley to summon his Holy Guardian Angel and the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage which Crowley attempted at Boleskin House on the shores of Loch Ness. The ritual allegedly requires at least 6 months of preparation, celibacy and abstinence from alcohol. However, it also includes the summoning of the 12 Kings and Dukes of Hell, to bind them and remove their negative influences from the magician's life. Crowley was in the process of performing the lengthy ritual, when he was called to Paris by the leader of the Golden Dawn. According legend,he never banished the demons he had summoned, leading to strange happenings occurring in and around Boleskine House. But I digress.There have been reviews that bang on about how slow this movie is, and it's lack of pace and excitement. But if you have any understanding of the supernatural, and this movie has been meticulously researched, you'd realise that the real horror lies in fear and what happens in your head. This woman, who so craves revenge, is on her own personal spiritual journey. She realises, at the 11th hour, that revenge and hatred offer nothing but pain and emptiness, and that forgiveness, both for her son's killers and herself, is what she really needs to find any peace.I liked the dynamic between the woman and occultist, the loathing and disrespect, the sharing and mutual need. There's one really funny moment where they both share their recurring dreams.The film is subtle in its suspense and horror, with a nice slow build and some really creepy effects. The ending seems a bit clich√©d, but was saved from being corny by illustrating the power of forgiveness over revenge, and good over evil. On the whole, one of the better horror/supernatural movies of 2017 so far. I loved it.",positive
Cut Bank,Horrible acting all around. The character Derpy Milton was ridiculous. A lot the of the cut shots were unnecessary and did nothing to add to the movie.,negative
Cut Bank,"I don't know why there wasn't more talk about this movie, because I thought it was wonderful. There are no car chases or government spies jumping between rooftops, but simply a story driven movie. You can empathize with a couple of characters the acting is that good. However the movie is odd enough that the characters are best described as cartoonish in their single mindedness. Halfway through, you will know who is who and their roles play out as you'd expect. Still the acting shines through and it's nice to finally connect with the characters.No, perhaps this is not a blockbuster that people expectantly await for months ahead of time, but it's solid story-telling.",positive

This wasn't Everyman, this was deluded man gets updated reality check. And hapless side character agent person gets sacrificed to try and give the plot a way to move from stuck to concluded. Parole Officer did every nuance of it wayyyy better. Dunno why I didn't walk out.

Everly,"... that has confounded IMDb members since the inception of the site.Namely, why does the IMDb permit a rating of only ""1"" if they don't intend anyone to ever choose it? The obvious answer is that, they do indeed intend for this rating to be used, but the challenge is to find a film that justifies it.And with EVERLY I think we finally hit the jackpot.Start with (what I am assuming to be a FORMERLY) A-List actress and put her in a film that looks like it was written and produced and directed by a bunch of high schoolers who combined their allowances to produce something that would get them an interview with the Admissions Officer at a third rate film school.Not actually joking here. The bio of the director, as explained on the IMDb, tells us that he currently has more acting credits than directing credits (think about that for a moment) and that he started his career by taping two cameras together so he could make new films by editing other people's already-made films. Think about that too.As one might expect from this kind of film, it uses every trick known to keep costs down. Like no dialog for the first 10 minutes. No obvious plot. People enter the scenes randomly and either try to kill the star or are killed themselves.Strange lighting. Fast cuts. Lots of reaction shots (mainly Selma).In other words, anything to ""work around"" the usual ingredients of a film. Like a plot, a story, continuity, and other actors with dialog.A mainstream review I read (just to sure I was actually watching the finished film and not the dailies, or possibly a workprint) said that it is films like this that make us revere the genius of Tarantino.I have no comment on that. The line speaks for itself.I wish I could say the same about Everly.",negative
Everly,"Smokin' Aces + Kill Bill + Dredd = EverlyI found out about Everly late last year because of Fantastic Fest, and I've been pretty excited about it. It's about a woman faces down assassins sent by her ex, a mob boss, while holed up in her apartment - which sounded pretty similar to two movies I loved in 2012 (Dredd and The Raid: Redemption), and the pictures I saw during post made it look like a lot of fun.Selma Hayek plays the titular Everly, a Mexican prostitute. At 48, she looks great, and I haven't seen her kick ass like this since Desperado. She's the sole focus here, but some of the side characters are pretty interesting. My favorite was a character named Sadist, an old Japanese speaking psycho with some tricks in his bag. It's directed by Joe Lynch, a pretty small time filmmaker best known for directing Wrong Turn 2.Everly isn't going to win any awards for it's story. It's as one dimensional at best, and still manages to make little sense at times. It often falls into action movie tropes like bad guys hesitating to talk before pulling the trigger (of course leading to their demise), something that disappointed me seeing that Lynch was brought up on a steady diet of B-movies. Everly does bring one thing to the table though, and that is a hell of a lot of fun. There's no skimping on the blood here, people are shot, sliced, and blown up in all it's gory glory. There's a particular shot using an elevator that is amazingly awesome. It really tapped into what I love about action movies at points.The scope of the movie is as small as the budget, and although the story is pretty ""been-there-done-that"", if you're looking for some fun action that's not taking itself seriously, you really can't go wrong with Everly.My final score: B+",positive
Tales of Halloween,"I like a good, strange movie occasionally, but this one made little sense most of the time.I won't comment on the acting or effects, there are enough reviews that I have seen regarding those. And as a fan of the classic Universal monster, old Vincent Prince, Three Stooges and Abbott and Costello monster movies, I knkw that seldom does acting or effects determine my enjoyment of a spooky-season movie. Cohesive storytelling on the other hand, that is important. I can forgive a multitude of sins if the story makes sense.Tales of Halloween is described as ""the best horror anthology since Trick'r Treat"". But where Trick'r Treat's connectivity was integrated into each story, (characters appearing in the background, Sam being present, past events influencing more than one story), this rancid pile of pumpkin gut's connections are tenuous at best. The only real connection is the radio DJ narrative and a couple times you do catch a glimpse of characters from other stories. Few of the stories make any sort of sense if any at all, and those that do have the potential to make decent spooky story, Trick and Grim Grinning Ghost for example, are so short they might as well have been left out altogether.When you go back and read the blurb, these are supposed to be some of the top directors in horror. One would think, that an anthology created by top directors in a genre, would be more cohesive and fleshed out, but it feels more like they each just phoned it in.If anything, this mess mocks Halloween in general, and not in a fun satirical way. It's more like a school yard bully vs the nerdy, Halloween-loving kid.I would have preferred a return of Sam with new tales or even a return of The Crypt-keeper from the 90s.For my Halloween entertainment I'll stick to Trick'r Treat and Tales from the Crypt.",negative
Tales of Halloween,"i don't give '10' flippantly. this is a 10this turned up at the Mile High Horror Film Festival. it plays like a block of shorts in that each tale stands on it's own as a CreepShow style short story. consistent look and feel, and loose tying together though plays like a featureeach vignette has its own hook. don't be alarmed! watch each to the end to have that ""aha!"" momentcampy, fun, plenty of goo. not really scary in the traditional sense, but very entertaining all the same. more like a haunted house with little jumps and gags here and therecharacters overlap as extras from story to story, very clevermostly practical effects, yay! goo looks like props teams had fun coming up with these gagsrecommended!",positive

Rage,"This movie is fantastic - honestly, it's shooting up my 'So Bad It's Good' charts with a bullet (badoom-tish!) I have no idea why Danny Glover's character is in it. Feels like he phoned someone and said, 'I need fifty bucks and I'm free on Sunday. Anything going down?' Peter Stormare, whilst generally good fun in crap flicks, is so utterly miscast it's borderline genius. What's that accent Pete? I can't tell if you mean to sound like a Canadian with palsy, or you were battling some gastro/intestinal thing, but damn bro, you sound pretty crook. Cage with his helmet or hair or whatever that thing is on his head is brilliant. Injecting heartfelt emotion into scenes that don't need it, screaming in new and obscure ways, playing it cool after trashing 20 corpses and fifty cars, he just injects a well-needed shake-up on traditional acting. Let's be completely inappropriate and flip between ham and wood - hello Oscar! Script has the bones of something in it, but the director has taken a leaf out of Cage's book here - let's not polish the turd, but rough it up some. Camera-work is just dire, dialogue makes the idea of a four-hour cunnilingus session on an angle grinder sound appealing, and seeing as Glover already took fifty from the budget, it left only another fifty for the rest of the film. And let's not forget such a momentous closing scene. Never have I cheered so hard for Cage. Top work fella, and the right choice. I can't honestly ask anyone to sit through this utter tosh, but I do know I'll watch it again in the future, with a bottle of vodka in the wee hours, and laugh my ass off.",positive
Adult World,"This would be a one-or-two-star disaster, were it not for the presence of John Cusack to elevate it. I've been ruminating on what makes this so bad. The script is only mediocre, not awful, so the thing that really brings the whole film down is the casting. If they had cast actors with more imagination, they would have been able to bring a little more life to this dull material and made the film at least a 5-star average. As it is, this is mediocre at best and certainly not worth watching, unless you're a Cusack completist.",negative

Of course take part of her role and she is convincing, in fact she is a talented actress but maybe this part is not very suitable with her capacities. The film is watchable still the action takes place in small steps. It's the kind of picture that you can watch 15 minutes and FF another 15 and you will not miss anything. In fact if you view 30 minutes then continue the next day with another 30 and you finish the film in the third day, it may be more bearable.",positive
Radius,"Interesting at first. Kept looking for a big reveal. Constantly questioning the characters actions and reasoning. Why did they do that, or why did they say that.

Special mention must go to Shane Meadows favourite Johnny Harris who, as a cold-blooded ex-military henchman, exudes a barely-restrained predatory animalism, familiar to those who saw him in This is England '86.

And also the fact that they did it with a different culture was really cool too. When it comes to getting people scared, it had some really scary scenes. This movies deserves a much better rating. I hope they keep making horror movies like this one. And you do not need to see all the other movies for this one except for the first one. But besides that it was a very different story, with facts that are not revealed in the other movies.",positive
Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension,"This film, to put it very bluntly, was one of the worst horror films I have seen in recent years. The trailer for this film had me believing that The Paranormal Activity series may have come up with a new, truly scary, idea. The promise of, ""like something you've never seen,"" which flashes across the screen during the trailer convinced me that the film would have a new concept that finally revealed just how terrifying the Activities would have been if you could see them happening right in front of you. However, this film does exactly the opposite. It's literally the same idea that was introduced in previous Paranormal Activity films with the added exception of now you get to SEE the activity take place. Hmmmm that huge black figure hovering over my daughter is quite peculiar. I know i'll set up some more cameras, instead of getting my daughter the hell out of that room, so I can be reassured that she is truly getting staulked by a demon. The actors in this film are so incredibly unconvincing it pains me to watch. You know you picked the wrong people for the job when you walk out of the theatre and think the best performance was done by a 7 year old child. When the priest, who apparently knew nothing about exorcisms, learns overnight how to remove demons from a household he claims he knows what do. It was laughble. I kept waiting for him to hit a boom box that immediately started playing the Ghostbusters theme song. In all honesty, Bill Murray flying through the door with his proton pack, sucking up all the demons in the house, would have proved to been a better ending than what preceded. The Director's attempt to incorporate ideas from other horror films such as the Insidious series which introduced a sort of Ghost Dimension called the further, if you've seen this you know what I'm talking about, was a complete fail. The Ghost Dimensions scare factor was destroyed by a poor story line and sub-par actors and actresses. The jump scenes were so unoriginal they failed to even draw a wince out of a majority of the theatre. A movie that lasted 1 hour and 30 minutes provided the worst display of rising action I had ever scene. I sat there for an hour and 15 minutes anxiously waiting for a climax to the story, and when it did it was a huge let down. The Director apparently forgot that he need an ending to his uneventful story. ""O shoot you know what I forgot to write an ending because I was to busy trying to scare people with my incredible jump scenes. Better just kill everyone off."" The ending is so brief and SOOOO damn unoriginal I was tempted to start my rant right in the theatre. A lot of horror films are utter failures but something about this one forced me to write a poor review on it. The fact that these films still draw viewers, including myself, is beyond me. The Ghost Dimension places the cherry on top the mound of doodoo left behind by the previous 5 films. They've squeezed every last drop out of the franchise and in my opinion this film should be, and hopefully will be, the last installment for this franchise.",negative
Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension,"So, I saw an advanced preview of this film so there wasn't many ratings up. After the preview I looked and it was rating around an average of 5 out of 10.....did I miss something? I loved this movie, not enough to give it a 10, but enough.I think the main thing to focus on this film is the 3D, if you see it in 2D you have made a terrible terrible mistake. The 3D is amazing!! It actually legitimately makes you jump as the objects hurtle towards you, I flinched. Then the 3D element isn't just carried out with tricks like that, but actually all throughout the movie, as you see specks of the demons black liquid stuff (best way I can describe that) floating around, and it looks like you can reach out and touch it and the camera they use to see the demon (you'll see if you watch the movie) looks good in 3D.Sure, the actual storyline wasn't the absolute best, and the CGI was slightly less convincing....cause let's face it, when is CGI ever really truly convincing. But the acting was good, a believable family and an amazingly creepy little girl, and it was a genuinely thought out plot, easy to follow, carried on from the other films (so tied up loose ends), a little bit scary, a little bit nail biting. Overall a good horror movie. Go see it, but....see it in 3D, or you will miss out on the intended experience!",positive
The Devil's Candy,Of course I'm not going to spoil it but it is sad that people will have to find out for themselves how dumb the end of the movie is. The whole last 15-20 minutes or so are just tragic. I suspend disbelief and love terrible exploitation movies but this.... I was eye rolling the whole last part of the movie.,negative
The Devil's Candy,The devils candy delivers the king of sheer horror you don't see that often. I entered this movie thinking it was going to be boring and bad but I was proven so wrong. I do suggest that any horror fan should definitely watch this incredibly disturbing film.,positive
Moms' Night Out,"The critics got it right. The movie is awful.Having a popular star like Patricia Heaton in this movie is not enough to save it. The mothers and fathers depicted in this movie are mostly idiots and should never have had children. The script wouldn't have been approved for an ABC afternoon special because it's so poor.My wife and I went to see the movie because the 17 user reviews available at the time on IMDb gave the movie an 8 or above with accolades like: ""Love this movie,"" ""Perfect Mother's Day Fun,"" ""Funniest movie I have seen in a long time,"" and ""Greatest Movie Ever Made."" Don't believe any of these reviews. Having seen the movie, it's clear to me that the reviewers had an ulterior motive.My history teacher in college, when announcing the next test date, would always preface his remarks with ""I know a word to the wise is foolish."" This was generally aimed at those who would put off studying for the test until the last minute. Well, being foolish, I would like to offer a word to the wise which I failed to follow when considering this movie. For movies you are unsure you would like, don't trust a very positive or very negative review on IMDb unless you at least scan all of that user's reviews. This will give you an idea where the user is coming from; if his/her tastes agree with yours; and whether there are any ulterior motives in posting the review. If a film has been absolutely panned on Metacritic, like this one was, be careful about selecting to go to that movie in the theaters. IMDb is generally a good source of what the users say. The operative word is ""generally."" In this instance it was not.My review was a warning that this movie is not worth seeing. The fact that only 2 of 13 users so far found this warning helpful offers another clue about how IMDb reviewers can have an agenda. Who were the 11 people who found that my warning was not helpful? Are they the same people who find stop signs annoying or could they possibly be the same people who wrote the overwhelming positive reviews of this movie.",negative
Moms' Night Out,"Moms' Night Out is such a breath of fresh air! It's clean! I could take whoever I wanted to, and leave without blushing. The film will most likely appeal to moms (particular those with younger kids), as it is easy to relate and see yourself in the characters. I literally laughed out loud (even to the point of tears more than once) for the majority of the movie. Love, love, love it! A must see, and an especially great mother's day movie to enjoy with a mom.This is actually the second time I've seen the movie, and I thought it was just as funny the second time around! I've already planned two more group outings with my mom friends. I'm telling you, as a mom of preschoolers I loved it!I've read several reviews that were not favorable towards the movie, and I have to say the person writing the review must not be a mom (and possibly not a parent at all). The movie was written for someone like me. I get it. I know that I find some of the gags funny because I've either experienced them or something similar. Much of the movie is a true to life look at a moms life (not a complete look by any means, but I think every mom has had one of those days). I think if you fit their target audience, you'll love the film as much as I did.",positive
Pay the Ghost,"I actually don't mind ol' Nic, I find him amusing to watch, the 'it's my job.' character motivation thing. I Had read another reviewers post about this movie and can only heartily agree that he is obviously now at the stage where he is accepting jobs as is, no read through of scripts, no discussion of character;someone on his team (does he have a team?) is basically not doing their job and proof reading the material he is being offered.I wanted to enjoy this movie, it's a ghost story, I really only want any of them to do well, but they never do. I actually only found one section near the end of the movie interesting, then it went the way of the Dodo.Could I suggest just not seeing this movie, I could,but I wont, not really, go watch it, revel in it's crapness, be in awe that Hollywood produces garbage on this scale routinely all the time, it has such a bloody stranglehold over content and subject that again and again movies are just dire, they hold nothing and entertain no one, aside from idiots! The whole Hollywood system is just wrong.",negative
Pay the Ghost,"It's pretty generic ""lost my son! someone believe me supernatural forces are at work! i'll go get him myself!"" plot. The acting was well done. It wasn't super annoying (if you watched the Last Witch Hunter, it's that sort of quality of writing and acting but the CGI was worse in pay the ghost) Very predictable dialogue and storyline, but I am a fan of horror movies that aren't super gory or too much thriller or jump scares out of nowhere so this was PERFECT for me! I recommend entirely! I like Nic Cage movies and this is another one of his better films. I just like it when he's a dad and not a treasure hunter. I think he's getting to that age that he can't play the dad of young children anymore. He looks over 50!",positive
Max Steel,"One of the worst super hero movie of 2016. Extremely slow to tell a story, no action (except for the last few mins of the movie), too many annoying flash back. Seem like the director wasn't sure if he wants to make a sci-fi movie, chic flix, or comedy.. it turns out to be a big mess that drag on and on. People walking out in the middle of the movie, if it wasn't for my 11 year old, I would have done the same.. After the movie, my 11 year old even comment how bad the movie was! Here's an example of how slow the movie was.. the first min. of the movie, it also indicate Max has super power, it took about 30 mins of the movie to finally confirm his super power. Then another 40 mins of the movie to talk about nothing much with flash back.. and finally 5 mins of action (fight scene) to beat the bad guy. When you think it's all over.. they spend another 15 mins to put some unnecessary romance and filler to make the movie 92mins long, so that you don't think the movie is being too short.",negative
Max Steel,"Well lets take it one step at a time. 1) the movie starts well with a mystery going on around our main character and a good enough introduction of the rest of the characters. 2) the plot is good but it doesn't fit only to one movie so i hope for another one. 3) the end, well i am not gonna spoil this but the movie prepares the audience for the end (that makes the movie predictable -ish) but who doesn't like to say ""i knew it"". I liked max and defensively loved steel, i hope there was more about the background of steel and max but i put my faith on the next movie if there is going to be any. It's a movie decent enough to go on a sequel. So i am giving it a 10 because for the kind of movie it is it's very good.",positive
Early Man,"My family and I have been long-time fans of Aardman productions - Wallace and Gromit, Chicken Run, Pirates!, etc. Aardman Studios produces some of the very best stop-motion animation around, but ""Early Man"" was a clear miss. How do I know? Here's how...1) Within the first 10 minutes my wife and sister-in-law couldn't take any more and left the theater, they jumped ship to watch a different movie instead.
2) The best thing my college-aged son and daughter had to say about the movie as we were walking out was that ""at least we got some popcorn out of the deal."" BTW, they both grew up with and love Wallace and Gromit, and Aardman. 
3) The traditionally inventive, fresh feel of Aardman projects didn't happen, this project was stale and trite. The story development was weak and character development was even weaker. 
4) The entire story line was entirely predictable, there were no surprises at all. 
5) The charm of earlier Aardman projects was that they worked equally well for adults and children...not so this film. The few jokes that were in ""Early Man"" would go right over the heads of children and they were largely not that funny for adults. I had maybe one genuine laugh the entire movie. I do have to say that the idea of a championship soccer match between two groups thinly veiled as Brits and French was noteworthy. 
6) What's the film like? My daughter probably summed it up best, ""Chicken Run"" in reverse, but neither memorable nor funny. Animation quality = 10
Story line and character development = 2
Humor = 3
Fun = 2
Disappointment = 9It breaks my heart to rate this movie this low, but there's no way to avoid it.",negative
Early Man,"This movie was a tremendous parade of laughter, animation, and storyline! It wasn't your typical Aardman movie by any stretch of the imagination, This movie was Original which i am a stickler for, It had a top-notch cast, and it had a storyline that kids and adults can follow very easily.For people who are looking for an alternative to Wrinkle in Time or Black Panther, Go see Early Man and have a tremendous time with your family and learn some great lessons along the way!",positive
The Angriest Man in Brooklyn,"Stupendously bad. I have never seen so much talent in such a dreadful movie. One reviewer said it was like a video, badly shot with hung over actors at a rehearsal going wrong! I could not believe my eyes as talented actor after actor showed up in scenes and they were all so bad. It makes me truly think that directors, writers, and producers are the real stars in movies. This movie so so badly done on so many levels. who to blame? That is what I was thinking. Sometimes bad movies are fun to watch to see how bad they are, but this one was just cringe-worthy. There was not one moment where you were not very aware that you were watching a movie gone very wrong, and they all felt like they were ""acting"". The film looks cheap on all levels too. If you want to watch it just to see why it has so many bad reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, have a go. You want to have your FF handy though to buzz through it fast. I wonder if they all knew how bad it was while they were making it?",negative
The Angriest Man in Brooklyn,"I read many bad reviews of this picture and wasn't expecting much, but The Angriest Man in Brooklyn surprised me. It's a well-acted story with substance - a bittersweet tale of life as it is and life as it can be. The very strong cast included cameos by a stuttering James Earl Jones and a piggish Louis C.K. Yes, it's sentimental, but it's not sloppy about it. It's humorous without big laughs. It's quiet and subtle and altogether outstanding. It reminds us that the only normal people are the ones we don't really know. It shows us how important it is to try to be happy. Not your typical Hollywood, thank goodness.Portraying a man whose bad day has gone on for years, Robin Williams' performance is eerily grave. He is complemented by a strong cast and a simple story that makes its point. Well worth the price of the ticket, The Angriest Man in Brooklyn is a little gem.",positive
Shut In,"This movie can be summed up in a single word: awful. The performances were phoned in, the plot was weak, and the premise was ridiculous.***** SPOILERS *****The person who wrote this drivel apparently expected everyone to believe a number of complete implausibilities: that a catatonic boy who requires extreme care would be released to a home that lacks any accommodation for his condition other than an adjustable bed; that someone could convincingly fake being catatonic for six months; that despite his need to never be seen moving about, he also managed to slip his mother frequent doses of a tranquilizer that had been prescribed to him (we aren't shown how he managed this); that somehow the missing pills were never noticed during the six month period; that a raccoon rummaging in the garbage outside would wake her from her drug- induced sleep feeling compelled to investigate, but her supposedly catatonic son running around the house at night didn't disturb her a bit; and that the little boy trapped in the house only managed to make it to Naomi during the night when she was in drugged slumber and the fake catatonic was free to run around, not during the day when the fake catatonic had to sit passively in his chair or reveal his farce.In my experience, the care the makers' of a movie take with the minor details shows how much they care about the production as a whole. Here, they apparently didn't give a f---. An unexpected visitor tells the mother that the huge storm raging outside has already deposited so much snow that the end of her driveway was blocked when the road was plowed. Yet a little while later, when she runs outside, her driveway appears freshly plowed and there is a well beaten path to a dock on a little lake or pond. Despite the supposedly raging winter storm, the dock is free of snow and ice. Although it is supposed to be bitterly cold, there is not so much as a crust of ice on the pond/lake. This list could go on and on, but that's enough.In short, there are so many good movies out there, that it would be a shame to waste any time watching this one.",negative
Shut In,"I'm not sure why this movie is getting such bad reviews. I actually thought it was pretty good.I enjoy ""psychological thrillers"" that keep you guessing, and this movie kept me guessing. I wasn't sure what was real, who was doing what, or exactly how it would end.I thought the acting was great and that the scenery was lovely.If anything, it was a little more horror-esque than I really needed, but overall I did not feel as though it was a waste of time or money.I enjoyed the pacing of the movie and felt that they built up to a good climactic ending. Two thumbs up from me.",positive
Area 51,"Bought this film from Sky. What a load of crap. Only watched it because I'd paid money for it and thought it might get better. Unfortunately, it only got worse. If this had been free, I would have deleted it within 30 mins. Please, please, please, do not waste any of your life watching this utter crap. This Film Is Complete And Utter Rubbish. Quite honestly I think it was written and acted as if this was your first drama project in secondary school. You're given an idea and had to develop it. If I had been their teacher, I would have gave them an F, in fact it would have been ungraded. It was like they'd ran out of ideas at the end, or the school bell had rung and they had to make an ending. It was that bad, that there isn't even a soundtrack when the titles rolled at the end.",negative
Area 51,"First off; I'm a massive found footage fan. Always have been since the initial Blair Witch Project (Which I also thought was a masterpiece of a movie - Especially for the budget.) Even now, I still think it's completely relevant to the horror genre.Area 51 isn't perfect. I don't think any movie is; possibly with the exception of Fight Club. However it's the best piece of cinema I've seen lately. I think it's ludicrous that Area 51 has received a 4.3 rating when movies that are much worse (YellowBrickRoad) receive a much higher rating.Not even gonna lie; when I watched YellowBrickRoad I was expecting it to pick up any moment. The entire time. I was left feeling robbed, cheated and in a state of confusion - What the hell was that garbage?It seems reviewers on here only tend to give high ratings to the ""Artsy"" films with subtle hints at trivial things.. Like a plot. Or any body whatsoever to the movie..This was entertaining. It did the job and definitely does not deserve a 4.3 rating.",positive
Venus in Fur,"This is quite remarkable. Loved it when I saw it on theatrical release and love it still, now on Blu-ray. Remarkable because it is a filmed stage play on a single set with a cast of two and the fabulous Roman Polanski hardly some youngster. It is a great script playing cleverly with the origins of the classic, but difficult, Venus in Furs and bringing it devastatingly into the present day and more spine tinglingly into the reality of the two actors/participants. That Mathieu Amairic bares such a resemblance to Polanski and that Wanda/Venus/Goddess is played by the director's wife just adds more depth and intrigue. Amusing and breathtaking by turns and that Polanski keeps us, not only on our toes, but hoping for more presented with such limitations is indeed most remarkable.",negative
Venus in Fur,"I was thrilled, amused and caught in a tailspin of magic by the performances as Polanski's characters slowly seduced me into their inner circle and although I knew it to be farce, their elegant exchanges caught me off guard as I began to believe Vanda's every word and knew what she was up to. It was as if I were really viewing a dream of the author as he was writing the script. These two characters are as one. His dream is the script of his desire to relive his experience of subjugation, humiliation and total domination by his aunt when he was a young boy and Vanda is more than ready to strip him of all his defenses as he completely submits to her. The denouement comes when Vanda throws the author's cell phone across the room and breaks it after she has ""forced"" him to call his fianc√©e and let her know that he is not coming home and the delicious end as Vanda makes her retreat in her dance of victory and her subject is left to his bewildered and sensual dreams. He too is victorious.",positive
A-X-L,"Okay I did enjoy A-X-L romping around the desert with miles on his dirt bike, flying through the air as they bonded. A kid and his billion dollar super dog.With that out of the way, at about 40 minutes into the movie I realized two things. This militarized billion dollar dog weapon, soooo scary looking with super growling 'teeth' was as dangerous as a kitten. Second was the scene where super dog faces off with the evil 18 year old. Does it matter what weapon the 18 year old has? After all he's facing a billion dollar 'weapon of war', right? Suffice to say A-X-L is no match for a teenager. Later, when he targets an evil teen he is unable to stop the teen from running away and diving under a car. At no time does this screenplay have A-X-L take down even a single evil peson whether evil teen or evil military contractor who created him. Sure, he can run and bark like heck... but no where do we see a billion dollar weapon in action.Also, one could ask why A-X-L escapes from his creators in the first place?
Not a clue. After all, he was created to save the lives of our soldiers at war. Kind of a noble invention, yet as the movie begins he's gon AWOL. Why would he not wish to return to his creator and his mission to save our soldiers lives. That is in fact his prime directive, to bond with a single solder at war. It's not like he's a nuclear bomb we could debate. Again, screwy screenplay where evil creator is not really evil. One could say that A-X-L going AWOL was super dog being very, very bad dog!The notion one could build or rebuild an A-X-L in a garage with a soldering iron also left me scratching my head.Fun idea with an awful, nonsensical screenplay.",negative

Obvious Child,"I see only one woman has reviewed this, so that partially redeems women, who seem largely responsible for this mess. This story seems to have been told and re-told lately, and I'd like a new one, please. Late 20s-something female in the Big City is adrift, playing at ""comedy"" (although neither my wife nor I saw anything to laugh at), rejected (quite rightly) by her boyfriend, and has a nothing job in a bookstore that's going out of business. New guy inexplicably falls for her, they have sex, she gets pregnant, decides to have an abortion, eventually tells him, he says nothing but supports her by going with her to the clinic, and then they start to watch Gone With the Wind (although where are the bells in the opening soundtrack of GWTW?). Sadly, the Jenny Slate character doesn't seem to have any redeeming qualities. Self-pity is not a redeeming quality. There is no indication whatsoever as to why the guy falls for her, other than the fact that she seems to be available and drunk. And I have to say the abrupt ending threw me. So¬Öafter spending almost two hours of my life, what's my takeaway here? Abortion good, hard work bad? Some guys will date almost anyone? What's the point in trying because I can't be as good as my mother? If this was indeed about abortion, as some seem to think, it doesn't get much air time¬ÖJenny says ""I thought about it"" and leaves it at that. We have no indication as to what thoughts entered her mind. The guy has no say. Really? The only likable character was her mother: was this to remind us that that ""Thirty-Something"" (where the actress gained fame and fortune) was actually a far superior show about young people? And I'm sorry, but why the title? ""Obvious Child""? Who's the child? Jenny? If it's the aborted baby, why on earth is he/she obvious? And if it's Jenny, are we supposed to celebrate that fact that she's 28 or so and totally clueless? Is that a good thing? Sorry, thumbs way down from me.",negative
Obvious Child,"Over the years, the film industry has churned out plenty of comedies about the perils of dealing with unexpected pregnancy, but never has the subject been approached from such a refreshingly different point of view than in Gillian Robespierre's Obvious Child. Donna (Jenny Slate) is an aspiring stand-up comedian whose relationship with her long-term boyfriend has just come to a screeching halt, courtesy of his philandering. Angry and despondent, Donna unleashes her frustration onstage, crashing and burning in front of the audience before finding solace in genuine nice guy Max (Jake Lacy), with whom she shares a few drinks - and a bed.When Donna discovers a few weeks later that she's pregnant, her life is thrown into upheaval. A child certainly isn't on her list of desired acquisitions, and after evaluating her options with best friend Nellie (Gaby Hoffmann), she elects to have an abortion. There's just one problem: Max, the one-night stand who also happens to be the sweetest, most courteous person Donna has ever met, and is obviously interested in more than just a casual fling.Obvious Child differs from other pregnancy rom-coms by approaching a uniquely feminine issue from a decidedly feminine point of view. This is Donna's story, and while the film is most definitely a comedy, it treats the subject matter with respect and dignity. It's also a standout performance from Slate, who runs the full gamut of the emotional spectrum, gleefully reveling in Donna's raunchy stand-up act one moment, and losing herself in a tearjerking scene between Donna and her overbearing (but not unloving) mother in the next.Obvious Child will likely bear the unfortunate distinction of being known as ""the abortion movie,"" but to oversimplify the film and marginalize it in such a manner is a huge disservice. Yes, it deals with abortion, but more importantly, it deals with womanhood in a way that few films have ever dared. It's an authentic, emotional, and yes, hilarious portrait of a young woman trying to find her way, and should be considered a landmark achievement in feminist filmmaking.-- Brent Hankins",positive
I.T.,"This film tells the story of a successful businessman, who hires a young man good at information technology. When the businessman wants to set boundaries with his young employee, things quickly sour and turn dangerous.I think this story reminds us of the dangers of sharing too much on the internet. It is a fairly convincing story of how cyber stalking occurs and just how scary it can be. What I don't understand is why the businessman initially invites the employee to have a drink but subsequently wants to set a boundary. This minor inconsistency could have been easily rectified, and the story would have been even more tight and convincing. At the current state, ""I.T."" is still a good thriller that keeps me interested throughout.",negative

Cop Car,"If Lloyd and Harry of ""Dumb and Dumber"" were ever kids, this could be a movie about them ! Two of the Dumbest kids I have ever seen on cinema, steal a Cop Car and go on an adventure. (The fact that the kids are young is not an excuse for such an amount of stupidity.) Calling this movie a Thriller,in my opinion is not an accurate category description. Maybe if they edit out the blood they can release it as a ""Family"" Comedy. That would make more sense... I am very disappointed to see Kevin Bacon ""starring"" in such a terrible movie after his great work on ""The Following"". The performance of the two kids was not good. This is definitely one movie you can live without...",negative
Cop Car,"In my opinion 'Cop Car' can be described as a surreal adventure for two intrepid young souls. Two boys about 9 or 10 years old are taken with 'running away from home' and discover the world outside of their youthful knowledge & experience is more than they ever imagined.Director/writer: Jon Watts and writer: Christopher D. Ford have smartly kept the dialog minimal and the setting vast and expansive. In doing this the viewer must concentrate solely on and only on the main characters - Kretzer, Travis & Harrison. These three are the story! In the grand open landscape they are the only movement & action to be seen.The pacing of the movie takes the viewer on a roller coaster ride of tension and suspense. Just like a roller coaster the start is a slow climb up then the action starts. You do not know what is going to happen to the two intrepid boys (Travis & Harrison) while they are innocently on their own. Then Kretzer shows up and the tension builds and builds.This is a fine bit of cinema - simple, fast, suspenseful - and only 4 main characters to concentrate on. I recommend watching this movie because anyone who likes a real 'seat gripper' gets a great payoff.",positive
Infinitely Polar Bear,"I really thought this movie could be awesome, I love Mark Ruffalo, Zoe Saldana's pretty cool, the kids looked cute and I love indie movies and movies that are set in the 70s. But there really wasn't much to like about this film.As a previous reviewer said, the way that manic depression is depicted in this movie is too glib. Having a severely mentally ill person as the guardian of two children is more of a tragedy than a comedy. The movie kind of suggested that having a bipolar parent would be like a fun roller coaster ride with lots of exciting moments and singing.The most surprising element of this movie was that the children's characters were made to be so unlikeable. The two girls were extremely self-absorbed, cruel, and annoying towards their mentally ill father. I kept thinking that I would also go insane if I had those two for daughters. They whined and complained through the entire movie. The mentally ill dad would try to do something positive, and his daughters would scream at him, put him down, tell him his ideas were stupid and refuse to help. They seemed to be actively provoking him at times.I didn't get the point of this movie. I liked the costumes and the set design, but the story was really sub-par.",negative
Infinitely Polar Bear,"In the late 70's, in Boston, the bipolar Cameron ""Cam"" Stuart (Mark Ruffalo) lives with his mulatto wife Maggie (Zoe Saldana) and their daughters Amelia (Imogene Wolodarsky) and Faith (Ashley Aufderheide) in an isolated house in the countryside. When Cam is fired from his job, he has a mental breakdown and Maggie is forced to institutionalize him. When he is released, he moves to a small apartment while Maggie works to support the children. She decides to apply to an MBA to improve her income and she is accepted by the Columbia University in New York. She asks Cam to take care of the girls for eighteen months and he agrees despite his fears. Maggie moves to New York and Cam is responsible for Amelia and Faith education. Will the scheme work?""Infinitely Polar Bear"" is a heartwarming film with outstanding performances. The dramatic situation of Cameron is shallow, but the movie is delightful to watch. Just as a curiosity, the girl Imogene Wolodarsky is the daughter of the director Maya Forbes. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Sentimentos que Curam"" (""Feelings that Heel"")",positive
Howl,"A story on stranded train passengers in the middle of the forest at the wee end of the night against unknown blood thirsty creatures makes for a good horror story on paper but when it comes to translating it into a creature feature, screenwriter/director has failed big time. A very predictable clich√©-ridden screenplay with utterly boring action sequences in which none of the characters on the screen garners viewer's interest/sympathy, making it a very dull affair. The film is filled with such ridiculously unbelievable stupid characters/moronic moments from starting frame to the end frame that it's not even comes closer to those films which are so bad that it's good category. This film needs its own category in terms of how awful a creature feature can go.There are hardly any redeeming qualities that I could find in this unadulterated pathetic excuse for a film of epic proportion.",negative
Howl,"Werewolves on a train! What's not to like about that?! A bunch of varied commuters get stranded on a broken down late night train in the middle of the woods. After the driver disappears, they try to walk up the tracks they soon regret it - something is out there and it wants in! This creature feature totally does what it says on the tin - scary as hell monsters, believable characters from different background fighting to live through the night - plenty of gore but loads of fun too. A real stand out bad guy performance from Elliot Cowan as a psycho banker determined to survive. Great comic relief too from Amit Shah as a nerdy accountant who turns out to be surprisingly handy in a fight! Great cameos from Sean Pertwee, Rosie Day and Duncan Preston. Recommended.",positive
The Little Death,"I'd turn up the rating on this film to 11 if my amp went that high: it's really that good. Superlatives are overused and not always helpful, so I'll give some comparative praise: it's the first film to make me laugh harder than either Mel Brooks' ""Young Frankenstein"" or the 'Bigus Dickus' scene in Monty Python's ""Life of Brian""... It was as touching and romantic as ""Love Actually"" or Baz Luhrman's ""Moulin Rouge"" (if not more so); had as many wrenching and completely unpredictable twists and turns as the best of Hitchcock, and the ending had a twist guaranteed to be as surprising as anything you've seen‚Äîexcept that the end first took a quick 90-degree turn before hitting you with a 180. The writer-director, Josh Lawson, has produced a truly perfect little masterpiece with ""The Little Death"", full of subtlety, whimsy, good humor and genuinely side-splitting comedy. It's not for everyone, but I can't recommend this film highly enough.",negative
The Little Death,"The first thing I did after watching the film was check social media - was it just me or did everyone else agree this was a great flick? Happily it wasn't just me, I couldn't find a bad tweet. Yes, it's an awkward topic, and not that I'm a prude but I did have trepidations about going to see a movie about sexual fetishes. But actually, that's what gave it it's humour, along with the incredible performances by not one, but every single cast member. At no time did I wish that we went back to one of the other story lines because each one was engaging in its own right. The film somehow manages to be light hearted and appealing to adults of all ages, while at the same time meandering through sophisticated undertones and delivering a few thought provoking messages. This is not just a fantastic example of Australian talent, it is a brilliant movie.",positive
The Art of the Steal,"It seems like forever since I saw Kurt Russell in something. I almost thought he was retired. Then I saw this at my local theater and realized Kurt is still rocking the old Snake Plissken hair style. That's OK, caused it works for him, and despite sporting the hair do for more than thirty years, it makes him look young and vibrate. As the title suggest, Kurt plays an experience thief. More precise he's Crunch Calhoun, a wheel man in a crew that also has his half-brother, Nicky Calhoun played by Matt Dillon as a member and Idea man. On their last Heist, Nicky gets caught and rats on his brother to stay out of Jail.After serving his time, Crunch becomes a struggling daredevil who gets pulled back into the game by his no good brother, who stumbles upon the ultimate Art Heist. That's how the title of the film doubles its cleverness, their a crew of experience art thieves, but that's where the cleverness really stops. I don't know if it's because everyone played their roles so dead on or because everyone was phoning in their performances for a pay check, but the film is way too predictable. The film follows the heist formula to the letter, and attempts to throw you off the scent, particularly with Jay Baruchel's character Francie, a thief who befriends Crunch at a time when the man was living on the up and up, and Katheryn Winnick who plays Crunch's girlfriend, Lola whose character's agenda could have kept me on the edge of my seat caused of a semi-love Triangle she created between Crunch and Nicky, but her character would have needed to be more developed to accomplish that. With the exception of Lola, The movie stands mostly on how interesting the actors made the characters they played. Watching them interact with each other was the best part. Like with veteran actor, Terrance Stamp playing a paroled ex-art thief force to work with a bumbling Interpol agent assigned to catch the crew doing something wrong in order to win his freedom. It is worth taking a gander at just to see Russell (and his hair), pal around with some interesting characters played by some decent actors, but it's nothing to go out of your way to see.",negative
The Art of the Steal,"This was WAAAAYYYY better than what I thought it was going to be. There are very few movies I don't like of Kurt Russell's but the rest of the cast was pretty awesome too. The comedy part that stood out to me was the banter of Terence Stamp. Funny stuff there! If you like Jay Baruchel's acting, you'll get some great scenes with him too. Especially when he had the beard on at the border crossing. Wasn't any nudity that I could think of which is always a bummer but good for the kids. While not action packed like Italian Job or movies of the sort, it was still a great watch. Definitely stay for the end credits as there are some out takes.",positive

Only if you are a foreigner who visited and explored the Greek culture somehow you will be able to feel closer to those amazing people... watch the movie took me back to the best two months I have had abroad of my country... listening to the Greek accent, the happiness and union of Greek families, the pita- gyros somewhere and some Greek words that I still remember;all that little stuff relives feelings and memories I will never forget... Thank You Greece!!!",positive
The Love Punch,"This was an amusing film - but nothing more than that really. In my humble opinion it fell short in a number of ways and missed out on several opportunities to play on the 'middle age/getting older/struggling-to-cope-with-the-modern-world' jokes. When it did do this however, it was very funny - but there were never really those laugh-out-loud moments that one would have hoped to find in a film with a cast of such combined considerable talent and experience. Unfortunately, there seemed to be this constant feeling that the four main actors involved (Emma Thompson, Pierce Brosnan) were holding back and could have done better - although it has to be said that the chemistry between all four (and most especially Thompson and Brosnan as ex-spouses) worked really well. However, the stunning locations of Paris and the French Riviera definitely help with taking your mind off the rather silly plot; I ignorantly didn't realize parts of France are so stunningly beautiful. Emma Thompson in particular does her very best with the weak material, proving, as if I didn't already know, that she is one of the most versatile and talented actresses around.But, for me, the film's main surprise is Timothy Spall! He was the funniest guy in this comedy, in my opinion he really stole the show from Emma and Pierce together, he had some really funny jokes and his character is really peculiar and strange.. I loved it! Anyway, the script for this film seemed to 'fall between two stalls' as it were and was neither one thing or the other, resulting in a sort of grey hit-and-miss humour and genre. Perhaps it just tried too hard to be clever and witty, and it may have just been a simple case of 'less is more' - it certainly seemed to thrum along at a fair pace and complexity of plot.Overall rating: 6 out of 10.",negative
The Love Punch,"Emma Thompson and Pierce Brosnan play a divorced couple whose retirement funds and savings are stolen by an unscrupulous French businessman. They enlist the help of their good friends, played by Timothy Spall and Celie Imrie, to carry out a plan to recover what they lost. It's a far-fetched, crazy plot involving kidnap, scuba-diving, impersonation, jewel theft, and wedding-crashing. The zany plot contrasts nicely with the normal, suburban lives lived by the main characters. Oddly enough, even with the outlandish plot, the ending is predictable. That may be due to the fact that it's really a romantic comedy dressed up in an adventure. This movie is likable, but stops short of being great.This is one of my favourite Emma Thompson roles, largely because she has resisted her frequent tendency to over-act. She has a couple of really wonderful lines, most notably ""we should nick it"", delivered exactly right. Pierce Brosnan does a believable job of playing the aging hunk who is starting to realize he's not 21 anymore. The movie is not hilarious, but does deliver several laughs. Thompson and Brosnan are funny together, particularly the scene in Paris in which Thompson cannot believe that Brosnan's driving skills have not improved over the years.Despite silly plot failings, this movie is worth watching simply to see four really good lead actors show us how it's done.",positive
The Super,"When Val Kilmers character tries to stop the little girl which is clearly pure evil, then a resident lady hits him and thereby stops Vals character from performing some sort of excorcism, and the evil is saved??? But when the little girl is clearly and obviously evil, why stop Vals character???
It doesnt make any sense?
The whole ending by the way doesnt make sense.",negative
The Super,"The Super is a mystery thriller that features Val Kilmer in a great supporting role that I just saw at a film festival. The movie is about Phil Lodge and his two daughters that move into an apartment building in New York. Phil also works there as a superintendent with several colleagues. Among them is Walter, played by Val Kilmer, who seems a bit off and the the residents start disappearing...The movie takes a simple concept but gives it a nice and welcome twist that caught me by surprise. I don't want to spoil anything here but I really enjoyed it. The movie is quite dark and also has a couple of scares but it is not really a horror film I would say. More of a mystery thriller with some gore. There is some great camera-work and directing there and I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of John Patrick Flueger in the future.",positive
Freier Fall,"Free Fall has shown up on a lot of lists of good gay films and while it's viewing it's really nothing you haven't seen before if you watch a lot of queer movies. How you receive Free Fall might be based on your personal experience dealing with your sexuality (if you're one of those later-in-life guys) but more than likely it'll have a lot to do with how attractive you find the lead male characters, Marc and Kay, to be.Plot wise Free Fall very much like Broke Back Mountain (a manly straight guy discovers, with the help of a more aware acquaintance, that he's not so straight). I also has a lot in common with some 80s and 90s films and TV plots (man who is happily settled/settling in to family life discovers he's more than just a little curious about guys and how that revelation wreaks havoc on his life).Free Fall is fairly well crafted, it has an unvarnished, unsentimental quality which makes it seem like an almost clich√© moody European film. The film is tightly focused on the main characters (Marc, his pregnant girlfriend, and Kay) which creates a sometimes uncomfortable intimacy. But beyond the passionate relationship of the male leads (which is often shown in a clich√© queer movie fashion; fast and hard and quick) there's not much here.One has to wonder if Free Fall would be so well received if Kay and Marc weren't such good looking guys. Had this been the story of two guys who weren't ripped and chiseled but two average guys leading average lives who found themselves in love it might have been a more interesting film.",negative
Freier Fall,"Superbly shot, great dialogue, Overall, amazing cinema. Stephan Lacant ‚Äì Genius.The Film Stars Max Riemelt (Kay) as a young Police officer. A Stunningly Handsome character with a Striking Face. Cheeky, playful, lovable Kay. This is the kind of platonic (or otherwise) Best Buddy many men would like, regardless of sexuality. This film shows Riemelt with his best look yet.After some initial brushes, Kay becomes friends with Marc (Hanno Koffler). A fellow Officer training at the academy. Marc a married man who is expecting a baby with his Wife Bettina (Katharina Sch√ºttler). Eventually, Kay after a few flirty, maybe cheeky stunts, initially pushed aside as a ""Joke"" and a slight rebuff. Kay engages Marc in a an brief sexual encounter whilst out jogging. It is hard to say more without giving the plot away. But it is not long before things progress.Kay, whilst playing the passive character in this movie. He is the stronger of the two, who remains defiant and strong, the harder, better man. This, despite his loneliness, the rejection and aggression towards him. Meanwhile Marc struggles with his sexuality, feelings and family commitments. He deals with a separate set of emotional, anxious and eventual acceptances. Not forgetting bigotry that both men have to cope with.The film portrays a very real scenario. Situations that many people have or may find them in. Whether this be due to suppression of feelings, peer or family pressure. Watch the film, consider those you know and love. Then think! about it, that is the kind of movie this is. Not Arty or overly intellectual but very, very well scripted.All the actors play their roles well in this Movie. But it is obviously the two male leads that steal the limelight. Max's incredible looks and Handsome Hanno's rebuffs and reluctant start that turns into a happy, sexy swagger in his role.Please do watch this film with an open mind. The Sexual scenes are very well shot and far from seedy. The performances are outstanding. This is acting at its best, real life, gritty. The chemistry between them is electric. The looks and body language is just as you would expect in real life.I can't really put this into any one Genre of film. I cannot understand why it is in ""Gay & Lesbian"" sections either. This is a film that can be watched by all adults of any sexuality, intellectual level or background. But in order to enjoy and understand it, you might need a certain amount of understanding and acceptance.This is a movie that had my emotions up-down and all over, hairs raised, a kick in the guts, mixed thoughts. The works. I watched a couple of scenes to listen to the true spoken German Grammar. As one or two of the subtitles were amiss. I found this to be one of the best films I have ever watched. Whether or not you are happy with the ending is another matter.In Words: Powerful - Stunning ‚Äì Captivating ‚Äì Thrilling ‚Äì Sadness ‚Äì Happiness ‚Äì Gritty ‚Äì Enamour ‚Äì Drawing ‚Äì Sensual & Emotional.I would say there could never be Freier Fall II, too tacky.

Mistress America,"For those who saw Frances Ha, the film's overall writing style and pacing will not be a surprise. Saying that however, it doesn't overdo the ""cleverness"" in the same way Frances Ha did, and overall it kind of works better. Greta Gerwig has never been better. She really steals every second of her screen time and is really just such a marvel to watch. She infuses her own acting style to this in a different way, so it doesn't really feel like any of her other characters. The whole cast here is aces, and it leads to such a great work from the entire ensemble at Mimi Rose's house. I definitely recommend this. It's fast and it's a marvel to watch the characters say the dialogue in such a fun, quick way.",negative
Mistress America,"There are several reasons why Mistress America may be considered a wonderful movie. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and has a very sophisticated sense of humour. The main actors all have exaggerated characters that always behave in certain ways (kind of like the cast in The Office) -- and the actors play these roles to perfection.The writing and delivery of dialogue in the climax of the film is particularly amazing, with fast, witty exchanges filled with little jokes. Yet, the movie vacillates from hilarity to melancholy without warning the viewer, which makes the film all the more special.The depiction of and commentary on NYC, youth, etc. is all spot on, making this movie worth the watch.Finally, the soundtrack is excellent too, giving the movie a very alt/indie feel. Many negative reviewers sadly fail to appreciate the sophisticated writing and humour, along with the truly wonderful job that the lead actors have done in this unpretentious flick.",positive
Wheelman,"This movie gets grating after a while. Basically the entirety of the movie takes place with the lead actor behind the wheel, dashing from place to place while visibly upset and making liberal use of foul language. After about 1/2 of that (if not sooner) it starts to get old and I just wanted it to be over.",negative
Wheelman,"This spare, stark, simple double-cross story is hung on the bones of some of the best road-action camera work I've seen since the 1980s. The chase- scene shot sequencing hearkens back to the early giants of the genre: Bullit, The Driver, The Blues Brothers. The makers spend plenty of attention on watching the Wheelman manipulate the controls of his car and presenting realistic, easy-to-follow driving choreography. Nothing in this thing breaks your suspension of disbelief... unlike other multi-million dollar, CGI-choked car-chase franchises I can think of. Yes, as some reviewers have complained, most of the conflict is advanced through cell phone conversations, but that merely serves to throw the many actions sequences into even sharper relief. The director never pulls you out of the car to set you safely on the sidelines as the action goes whizzing by; you're in the seat with the bullets flicking past your head. Sit down, listen to the dialogue, and you'll like this inexpensive little jewel.",positive
V/H/S/2,"One night, my friends and I were discussing the V/H/S series, and one of them happened to mention thinking about streaming the sequel. Having seen the first one (and being left unsatisfied with it), I decided to check this one out so I could give her my opinion on it. I haven't been more repulsed and let down by a film.To start, the story line outside of the tapes is pretty much the same as the first movie's. There couldn't be another way for someone to discover the tapes? There's still not a way to connect all the tape stories together? That aside, my biggest problem with the movie is that the horror is not smart. There's no real psychological manipulation or realistic monsters. It's all just jumpscares and blood splashing around, because some filmmakers are still under the impression that abrupt loud noises and bodily injuries are scary.The detectives in this film discover four tapes. One guy gets an eye transplant that lets him see ghosts...the only thing cool about this one was the POV being just like a first-person view. He meets a woman with similar abilities, and then they have sex to techno music and that's never explained properly. The next tape is about a guy who gets turned into a zombie in the woods, then he eats some people, then they eat some people at a child's birthday party, then the guy kills himself. A pattern in these tapes is that a normal person encounters something weird, pokes it instead of fleeing, and then everybody dies. Every tape ends the same, so there's absolutely no element of fear from not knowing what to expect. What's to expect? Everybody's going to get murdered, just by a different monster.The next tape, I was absolutely enthralled by for the first while...it focuses on a group of documentary filmmakers who enter a cult accused of child abuse. I was so hooked to this one, until the first jumpscare. Then it escalates into a bizarre series of events, starting with children drinking poison, to people turning into zombies, to a really bad goat suit bursting out of a woman half its size. I've never seen so much potential completely immolated halfway through.The last tape at least had one funny bit where a group of kids burst in on a couple making out, but before I could even finish laughing, the Monster of the Day made a foghorn noise. (These aliens also looked like Slenderman with a cartoon alien's face, pincher hands, and chest hair.) This short features ten-year-olds saying the f-word, a child almost drowning, a preteen boy masturbating on screen, and a puppy falling from a great distance that dies slowly while gazing sadly into the camera. That wasn't clever, that was needlessly sick. The maker of this short was probably trying to assert how daring and edgy they were, but it just made me want to noogie them and shove their head in a toilet.The main tape ended with a woman turning into the girl from The Ring and a guy had an obviously fake dislocated tongue. I've got nothing.As a final film fart, the credits end with the same thing the first movie did...a choppy recap with obviously manmade glitches set to something that sounds like early 1990s punk rock. After that, the technical credits are a way creepier text-on-black set to tape hiss. As I thought after the first movie, you couldn't just keep up the creepy mood and use the black credits? You thought the obnoxious not- quite-dubstep really added something?What a complete disappointment. There was so much feedback on the first movie that the filmmakers could have learned from in this instalment, but they just did the exact same thing before, with old and new faults. This is one of the top five worst movies I've ever seen. If you liked the first movie, don't watch this. If you didn't like the first movie, don't watch this. If your sense of horror and humour are completely distorted, watch this, and then make an appointment with your doctor.",negative
V/H/S/2,"S-VHS is the follow up to last year's V/H/S, and features a new compilation of horror shorts from different directors. The main story is about two private investigators who are hired to find a missing college student. After breaking into his house, they find it empty, only with a pile of TV's and VHS tapes, which have ""WATCH"" written on them.This movie is shorter than the first one, but it's for the best, and whereas the first had 6 tapes, this one has 5, but each of them are better than the one's from the original.The tapes are shot in a POV style, and all of them include crazy things like aliens, zombies, demons, etc.REVIEW OF THE TAPES (IN ORDER OF Appearance):TAPE 47: Two investigators search for a missing student, and after breaking into his house, they start watching the VHS tapes that they find. The story still can't explain how the tapes ended up there, but you have to just forget about that, so it get's a 6/10CLINICAL TRIALS: This short is about a man who has replaced his eye with a cyborg-robot eye, and, for quality measures, the company of the eye decides to record what it sees for ""quality checks"". Things go very, very wrong when the eye starts recording ghosts of people around the house. This tape relies on jump-scares and is fun and scary at the same time, and includes a good underwater scene, so it get's a 7/10A RIDE IN THE PARK: This one is definitely the most innovating one and is about a biker that's riding his bicycle with a GoPro helmet, which has a camera. Soon, a zombie outbreak occurs and trying to rescue a woman, the biker gets bit and falls to the ground. He then ""wakes up"" and the rest of the tape is the zombie biker chasing and killing people, along with the rest of the horde. This one has a very cool scene where the biker storms a birthday party and starts biting the crap out of everyone, so it get's a good score of 8.5/10SAFE HAVEN: Alright, so this is the tape that you payed to watch. It is about an Indonesian film crew who is shooting a documentary about a mysterious cult that lives in the country side. The cult leader allows them to record, and soon, s*** hits the fan. I'm not going to tell you much about this one, because you just have to see it for yourself, because not only is this tape the best in S-VHS AND V/H/S, as it's one of the best short, modern-horror films that has been made. You may be thinking that this is just my opinion, but if you go read the critics reviews, they all say the same. Safe Haven constantly makes you feel uncomfortable and disturbed, as through the film, more gore and hideous creatures are shown, including a monster than will be burnt into your brain for years. Safe Haven is the longest tape in S-VHS, running through 40 minutes, but it's definitely worth a watch, and it's probably the reason the Blu-Ray will be bought for. Safe Haven gets a 10/10SLUMBER PARTY ALIEN ABDUCTION: Alright, if there was an Oscar for ""Best Movie Title"", this one would win. Not only is the title of this tape awesome, as the actual tape has some pretty spectacular scenes. SPAB is about a group of 13-year-old kids that are left alone with their big sister and her boyfriend at their lodge while their parents are gone for the day and night. This tape is the most spectacular. This tape is shot through a very uncommon way: the kids strap around a camera to their dog, and he records the kids doing things like building skate ramps and provoking their sister. Things go bad when creatures from outer space storm the lodge and everything gets noisy and crazy, with the creatures chasing the kids, while the dog is barking and going crazy. This one is easily the coolest and had the most ""WHAT THE F*** WAS THAT?"" moments, so it get's a 9/10VERDICT:S-VHS improves so much on the first one, not only on the quality of the tapes, as it removes most of the uninteresting stuff like the stupidity of some characters of the first movie. This is an anthology film, so character development can't be fully explored, but it's a good mix of adrenaline, fear and just pure fun, so make sure you watch this movie with a couple of friends, and not people that are snobs to this kind of films. You may think that I was overreacting with the ""Safe Haven"" segment, but trust me, I'm not. It is the best short horror film, and is the segment that you would think ""Damn, I wish that was an actual feature film"", so I'm pretty sure everyone will buy the movie just for that 40 minute film that's packed with scares, disturbing scenes and an incredible atmosphere that will make chills run through your spine.S-VHS gets an incredible score of 8.5/10",positive
Collide,"While ex-pat Casey Stein (Nicholas Hoult) is in a night club, he meets a bartender, Juliet (Felicity Jones) and they are in love. Julie makes Casey quit his life of crime working for Geran (Ben Kingsley) who deals in cocaine. Later we discover Juliet needs $200,000 for a kidney transplant. Casey gets involved in a crime which includes multiple chase scenes, car wreaks, and he must have gotten shot at 100 times or so...all misses. It was a one man ""fast and furious"" on the Autobahn.The film was fairly well constructed with only minor ""twists"" which was simply stuff we didn't see happen. It was primarily an action film first and love story second. The teaser crash scene in the beginning, comes at about an hour into the feature.Guide: No sex or nudity. I don't recall any F-words",negative
Collide,"It's one of those films with aimless narration. Indeed, it has a nice cast and characters with the basic storyline, but that did not expand and explored well as it should have been. At least the pace of the narration looked fine. Some characters looked unnecessary, and so a couple of scenes. If these all were managed, then still it could have been a decent film. Because since it is an action- adventure, they did not generate those crucial parts like the stunts and dialogues related to the gangster thing to turn it a better film in its kind.The two veteran actors coming together for the first time added more curiosity than flavour we are looking for. They did okay and so the rest of the cast. Ideal runtime, a few stuffs were in the favour of the film, but those were not enough for the overall success. If the same film was made from the non-English world like perhaps Germany, which was one of the producers of the film would have done better than this existing one which is very familiar with this language.People would watch it only for Hopkins and Kingley and so did am I. But they might end in disappointment, or that could be the reason to rate it fairly better. Whatever, this is an okay film, which is barely entertaining and of all, not a boring film. So trying it for one is okay, but I think not worth if you have got plenty of options over this one.6/10",positive
Intruders,"*Warning Spoilers in this review* I was thoroughly disappointed with this movie. The reason I'm calling it a bait and switch is because the trailer was so promising but the movie was terrible. This is not a horror movie. It is a drama/thriller and the only serial killer died in the beginning of the movie. I was really hoping for some good kills in this movie especially because there is a serial killer lair in the basement! Anne is pathetic. The trailer makes her look like a badass, but sadly she is not. However, the actress who played Anne did a great job of playing a timid woman who suffers from agoraphobia. This is basically a Hallmark movie that should have been titled ""From my father's ashes. - the story of a woman who overcame PTSD & agoraphobia by killing some bad guys."" I would have given this movie a 1 star but I really liked the woman who played Anne. So if you're into really slow burning movies with a feel good ""you go girl!"" ending, then this is your movie! But if you want to watch a real horror movie, skip this one.",negative
Intruders,"I randomly saw this movie while watching TV at home. I was pleasantly surprised. The plot was engaging and twisted. Remind you, I had not seen the trailer and knew nothing about it. I laughed so hard each time timid, petite little Anna annihilated one of those douche bags. I rooted for the female protagonist and she turned out to be quite the twisted little badass. And crazy as heck, but somehow, you still sympathize with her. Once she gets the upper hand its on! I loved the look on each one of those jerks faces when she pummeled them. That basement with all of its hidden quirks was also entertaining. For a channel surfing movie, it Rocked!",positive
Runner Runner,"Online gambling contributes massively to the entertainment industry. Whether it be your mother playing bingo, slots or even dabbling into a sly game of poker, there's no denying its infectious presence. Naturally, when individuals tell me that this wonderful flick is essentially '21' meets 'The Social Network', my eyes glisten at the idea. Then you watch Runner Runner and eventually conclude that running away from this snooze-fest is the best option. A student lacking the funds to complete his Masters degree, gambles his money and mysteriously loses it all on a gambling website. He travels to meet the boss to claim that he was cheated.Taking the aforementioned titles, there's poker and craps (not blackjack), no media entrepreneurial flavour (unlike Zuckerberg with Facebook) but there's Timberlake, so it has one common denominator. Unfortunately for this film, it has Timberlake. So you might as well throw that denominator into the ocean and let it drown. The main problem with this ""thriller"" is that you know exactly how the entire plot will pan out in the first five minutes. A story revolving around stealing is rather self-explanatory and leaves little to the imagination. The engrossing gambling aspect is rapidly discarded to make room for an uninspired money laundering story that lacks interesting characters and a tolerable script. So many underdeveloped clich√©s are thrown into the mix. FBI agents asking for assistance, a romance with the criminal's girlfriend and the most boring conclusion ever. Everything is tied neatly into a pretty pink bow and shipped off to Puerto Rico.Timberlake has the emotional range of a dollar bill. Arterton was horrendously underused. But atleast Affleck and Mackie were good, I guess. Furman embeds some nice shots here and there, particularly the parties where lens flares are constantly blinding you, yet it's just a distraction. An attempt to disguise the abhorrently dull story, executed in the most unexciting way possible, and the mediocre acting. Run run run run away!",negative
Runner Runner,"Runner Runner is a story about a student(Richie played by Justin Timberlake) at University of Princeton who is a pro in gambling and makes money by signing players into online poker tournaments in order to pay his college fees. However, he is pushed to risk it all as the college dean warns him of termination if he continues to advocate gambling on campus and sets a deadline to pay his tuition fees.Richie loses all his money in his attempt to hit a jackpot via an online poker tournament and discovers that he was swindled by the gaming corporation headed by Ivan (Ben Affleck) and he sets his foot in Costa Rica to lock horns with the gambling giant. Ivan recognizes the brilliance of Richie and gives him the life that he's been dreaming of. However, the tables turn when Richie finds the ulterior motive of Ivan's action and this is where the story falters. One expects a battle of wits to ensue but what follows is a series of lack lustre convincing acts by Ivan to make Richie remain in the trade. The movie moves at a slow pace and what hurts the movie most is you expect Richie's character to be more shrewd and to be a few steps ahead of Ivan but that doesn't happen till the end.With Agent Shavers (Anthony Mackie)and Croning (Anthony Cooper) bringing in a few laughs here and there the movie rather ends well. The fresh locales of Costa Rica were captured brilliantly.You are not missing anything if u fail to watch this movie but if u want to catch a glimpse of Costa Rica..",positive
Get a Job,"How the likes of Miles Teller, Anna Kendrick, Bryan Cranston, Marcia Gay Harden, Alison Brie, John C. McGinley, and Brandon T. Jackson, all most talented actors, can be in such a stinkeroo is a mystery to me. I'm no prude, but when a film is incredibly vulgar and mean-spirited and the intended humor falls flat as a pancake it just becomes torturous to watch. The customary 180 at the end of the film was way too little and way too late.I saw some reviewers state that this movie was ""in the can"" for 4 years before being released. Why inflict us now? I guess this is a puzzle only the filmmakers can know the answer to.",negative
Get a Job,"This movie was so bad I cringed throughout it. I didn't even laugh one time and usually I'm a lover of cheesy dumb comedy. With all the great actors in this movie, I expected more. The plot of the movie could've been good, but it was poorly executed.",positive
Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, I am a huge Johnny Knoxville fan. I find him hilarious and his films are great. Bad Grandpa is no exception. Bad Grandpa is hilarious, original, and has a few heartfelt moments.The acting is very good. Johnny Knoxville plays a very convincing old man who is hilarious and says some very outrageous things. Jackson Nicoll also performs very well. He has great comedic timing and, like Johnny Knoxville, is willing to say anything. The use of real people is another great aspect of the film.The pacing is fast but slows town towards the end. The runtime is just perfect.All of the jokes are funny and the stunts are all real.Pros: Hilarious story, good acting by Johnny Knoxville and Jackson Nicoll, great use of real people, fast pacing, a good runtime, and all of the jokes and stunts were funnyCons: Some slow pacing towards the endOverall Rating: 8.2",negative
Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa,"This is so much funnier than it should be. There were times in this movie that I just could not stop laughing. The people are all real, only the boy, and Knoxville and a select few are plants, the rest of this is like an insane episode of Just For Laughs out of Montreal, or the little shorts you see on a Jackass movie, just going on for the whole movie. Mostly skits like Letterman would do, but some far more toward the Chris Elliott side. You will hate yourself for laughing at parts of this movie, and there is just no getting around that, it is the basest humour, but it is done so well, and with that kid making everything feel just that little bit worse. I really Enjoyed this movie, I did not think I would, I was not expecting this sort of thing when I started watching it, and was surprised that the format is so much like Borat even, just not quite as far (or further)depends on your views. I would bet though no matter who you are, or how delicate your sensibilities, there is something in this movie that will have you on the floor, or at least holding your sides, and gasping for air. Anything that makes me laugh this hard gets a 10 as long as I was able to hold down my lunch. (a point was nearly lost, and so was my lunch)Jesse of www.jesse.ca",positive
Starry Eyes,"I say sort of because the film has an unnerving and tense momentum, with some truly freaky and horrifying (good horrifying) images and scenes. It's kind of obvious where the film is going though, but it has some clever direction and again, disorienting in a good way in some of its pacing and tone. The lead actress is really good, very unnerving. The problem is that the film also has these weak spots here and there, and I wish the last 15 minutes had at least tries to do a bit more than what we regularly get from horror films like this. Still, it's actually quite a nice surprise in some of the things it does. This is actually recommended.",negative
Starry Eyes,"Struggling young actress / Big Taters waitress gets an audition for a production company of some renown, but ultimately must choose to sell her soul or stick with her friends - with room to consider secret (film) societies, porn, modern media, drug abuse and such. A crude version of an age old story that will pop up anywhere near and around high concentrations of power, money, showbiz, what have you. Does it work?Partly. The cast do a decent job, Alex(andra) Essoe first of all. But of all the many crazy representatives of evil throughout the history of film, Louis Dezseran is not one who leaves a lasting impression. His two casting minions are much better, even if memories of David Lynch' 'Mullholland Drive' and 'Inland empire' immediately come to mind...The story is supposedly a slow burner (reminiscent of 'The house of the devil', which is much better), but it takes way too much time to my taste to get to its point. On the drama level, it did not get under my skin somehow; the group of friends who want to become actors or otherwise involved in the world of film, are pretty much an uninspiring bunch, I suppose. And to really get (and stay!) connected with the 'wanderings' of Sarah, was yet another problem.And then there's the gore, which makes the movie what it truly is: a horror movie - but that takes a while. In the end the violence r√©ally takes off, even if there are just a few moments here and there earlier on. The moment where one of the girls falls flat on her face causing Sarah to expose a sadistic side of her, was one of the rare moments that fully worked, actually.5 out of 10; certainly not the intelligent horror some reviews caused me to anticipate.",positive
The Lazarus Effect,"The Lazarus Effect (2015) ** (out of 4) A group of scientist discover a formula that could help bring the dead back to life. The main scientist Frank (Mark Duplass) and his fianc√© (Olivia Wilde) mess up when signing their contract and end up getting kicked out of the laboratory. Needing to get enough of their records to carry on, the group sneak back into the lab but after an accident Frank's fianc√© is killed. They decide to use the formula to bring her back to life but things don't go as planned.THE LAZARUS EFFECT has a few interesting ideas and some great performances, which keep it from being a complete trainwreck but there's no question that the film doesn't take its subject serious enough to have the film work. There's no question that there are elements of FLATLINERS here but people will also be thinking of LUCY, which was released the previous year as this film.It should be noted that without the end credits this movie runs just 76 minutes, which is extremely short in today's time. I personally love shorter movies but this one here is just so uneven that the film pretty much ends just as you feel it should be taking off. I say that because there are some interesting ideas about Heaven and Hell here but sadly very few of them are fully explored because once the fianc√© is brought back to life the film turns into a rather generic horror movie. I'm not sure why the screenplay would introduce such good idea but then not do anything with them and especially since the film is so short and could have been expanded on.The performances in the film is what save it and help carry the material. Both Duplass and Wilde are very good and especially believable in their roles. Supporting players Sarah Bolger, Evan Peters and Donald Glover are also very good. Technically speaking the film features a nice score, good cinematography and the director certainly makes a professional looking film. With that said, THE LAZARUS EFFECT completely falls apart during the final fifteen minutes, which is a real shame.",negative
The Lazarus Effect,"I've long stopped going to horror movies expecting to get scared, or see anything remotely decent. Instead I view them as comedy movies, trying to entertain myself by how bad the films are, so it's pretty safe to say my expectations when seeing a horror movie are about as low as it gets and yet ""The Lazarus Effect"" still left me astonished by just how bad, uninteresting and not even remotely scary it was. There was nothing new or unique about the movie, and literally the only aspect of the movie that could be considered scary (if you're not already desensitized to those, like most people) were the jump scares, and even those were predictable.I've been disappointed by a lot of movies, but this is thee first time it was bad enough that I actually took the time to write out a review.",positive
Heaven Is for Real,"I went to see this movie with great anticipation after reading the very well written book by Pastor Todd Burpo a couple of years ago. In fact, I went to see it the very first weekend it was in the cinema. However, after having read ""The Client"" many, many years ago and then seeing the movie on the silver screen, I was very disappointed with what Hollywood can do to a book when they try to turn it into a movie, so I had a bit of apprehension, too, when ""Heaven is for Real"" started playing. About halfway through the movie, I wanted to get up and leave. The screenwriters left about 75% of the book out of the film entirely. The film wasn't centered around Colton Burpo and his incredible glimpse of Heaven, but rather it was largely about his father, Todd, and the struggles he encountered in dealing with young Coltons' revelations. Even the way Colton initially divulged his experience to his parents was different from the book. It seemed to me that the screenwriters wanted to dramatize the movie and create some suspense where there shouldn't have been any in the depicted struggles between Todd and his wife. Do yourself a favor and read the book instead. You will be sadly disappointed with the film if you've read the book beforehand.",negative
Heaven Is for Real,"I hate the way people pull apart movies trying to determine an underlying message that is being given to us. Why can't you just accept a movie for what it is, why do you have to pick it apart. Not every person who rates this as great is religious but a lot of you are branding this movie as a bible beating religious crowds movie when that is not so. I loved this movie because i think it speaks to each and every one of us, to me it gives me hope that there is something wonderful out there besides the chaos of the world we live in, where all people do is fight, and cheat and lie and hate, where we steal from one another, kill one another etc. If this brings hope, if some people believe that this is real then let them do so. If you choose not to like it or believe then don't. As a species we should all be living our lives better than what we do, we take everything for granted and we have become greedy and self absorbed, everything is about what you can get for yourself. And as for the person who said every experience like what the kid had has always been linked to flat lining, then your wrong, thats not always the case.",positive
War on Everyone,"The trouble with John Michael McDonagh is that he's not half as clever as he thinks he is or that he would like us to think he is. If he was really smart he wouldn't be making pretentious crap like ""War on Everyone"". This should have been just another buddy cop movie with a lineage that goes all the way back to the seventies but that would have been too common-place for a man like McDonagh, the much less talented brother of playwright and filmmaker Martin McDonagh.""War on Everyone"" is a semi-serious, name-dropping, (from feminism, the classics, literature, the movies, popular music; the kind of things 'smart' people are supposed to know about), buddy movie, all done in the worst possible taste which isn't a problem in itself; I love bad taste when it's funny but this just isn't funny. On the plus side, the ridiculously handsome Alexander Skarsgard, (son of Stellan), who plays one half of our pair of anti-heroes, shows that given a half decent script he might even be able to deliver the goods. Otherwise, that's about it. Don't waste your time.",negative
War on Everyone,I was laughing out loud. The comedy was perfectly balanced with harsh realities.,positive
The Red Turtle,"I can't say I'm a fan. It is okay at best and completely indie but doesn't cook the goose or pass any finish lines. If you think about it, any film that isn't from a major Hollywood studio film is an indie film (Shocker! Right?) however our collective culture has associated the term ""indie"" as something positive when in fact it is simply a categorization. So I'm going to give you the hard knocked truth about this anime. The animation is weak and annoying but grows on you to the point of being bearable. The story isn't remarkable and maybe even pretentious. Basically, the guy goes insane and makes out with a sea turtle for twenty years or so. Heck, that can happen to the best of us, so who am I to judge? But as you can tell from the reviews, people are overthinking this one and making it out to be more than it is because we are living in an age where CGI-animation is the way to grab eyes. Am I coming off as mean? Try this on for size, I think hipsters and trendies are overhyping this film because they frankly can not think for themselves. Deal with it.",negative
The Red Turtle,"Before starting watching the movie I strongly recommend to listen or even better to watch Leonard Cohen's video clip ""Dance Me to the End of Love"". The animated movie as well as Cohen's clip is about life, obstacles, hardness, love, children, death - about the life as is. Sometimes lonely, sometimes happy, sometimes on the edge of death.The plot is quite simple: the main hero appears on uninhabited island and first tries to survive, then to escape and then just just to live.It is real philosophical piece of art about which one can write thesis after thesis. A scope of issues reveled for discussions is vast: about the purpose of life, about love, about loneliness, about striving of the youth for changes, desire to live, to die, nature, animals and much much more. I was extremely touched with the few very nice moments: - First - when the main hero being on the uninhabited island but alive suddenly falls down from the rock inside the deep cave with water from which you can not get out. I physically feel myself uncomfortable from realizing the situation - to survive but appear on the island and immediately after to face danger of being helplessly drowned in the cave - Second - when woman is touching the face of the main hero after years or months of loneliness (heroes do not talk - you can see the time only by means of his beard only). Deeply touching moment - and once again, while sitting in the cinema you almost physically feel the tenderness of this touch. - Third - after the main hero met woman and set a family and they gave a birth to a child and child has grown up and it looked like ""life is happy""drastic storm from the sea arrives and almost kills all of them.And the final and the most beautiful moment, in my opinion: after their son left them and they reached old age (one can guess of it from the gray hairs om his and her) and it is obvious that soon they will die they ""dance to the end of love"" - again and again deeply touching and moving moment.Very very beautiful movie - a must see piece of art for those who are fond of thought provoking movies.",positive
Brick Mansions,"I like the good cinematography, even the opening credits alone already made me liked it. David Belle is still very cool with his spins, back-flips, jumps and other stunts. It has been 10 years but I don't see any degradation of his parkour skills.Paul Walker did good as Belle's partner-in-crime, even though he can't do parkour, he still kicked-ass. Catalina Dennis who plays Belle's girlfriend is consistent with her character, a tough girl who doesn't stand still with unfair treatments. The lousy one is RZA who plays the drug lord Tremain. Well, in my opinion he can't act, his face expression just doesn't make it.For those who like parkour but haven't watched Banlieue 13, this might as well be in your watchlist. It's still okay even if you have watched Banlieue 13 (like me), because it was in French and it felt quite weird, even with subtitles.",negative
Brick Mansions,"Well, this belongs to the realm of completely unnecessary remakes, since the source material also was found wanting to begin with. With that out of the way, a description can be made of the changes for this remake of 'Banlieu 13' or 'District 13':Cyril Rafaelli, who was cast in the unnecessary sequel as well, is missed here, since he was an able Parkour counterpart to Belle in the original. Walker's visible lack of martial-arts talent is made more conspicuous because of this. The'sister' is now the 'ex-girlfriend'. - There is now a lady lesbian villianness. The 'dad' angle. The not-too-evil baddies. Badly choreographed Parkour and non-Parkour action sequences. Really sad, since this was the movie's apparent USP. An older, unenthusiastic David Belle.The only person who seemed to be giving it all here is RZA, who chomps into his suave-looking bad guy role with gusto that could have been served better by its writers/makers. He did the same job in 'Protector 2', which was probably worse. Hope he gets better material in his next go-around.The CGI's bad, the writing's bad, the production design's possibly some of the worst you can get, and this ideally should've been ignored on cable as well.Feel sad for David Belle, and worse for 'Parkour'. Watch 'Banlieu 13' instead, or even the unnecessary sequel, and give this one a miss.",positive

Unfortunately, they didn't have the funds or imagination. The result compares unfavorably with the average movie made for the syfi channel.Thomas Jayne was obviously embarrassed to be in this since he obscured his looks in shambling meth addict wardrobe and makeup.

Vice,"If you are an IMDb ""reviewer in training,"" this is a great place to start. It is sorta like a ""starter hill"" in skiing, just a nice gentle downhill slope to start your review on, and then your own momentum will take you safely to the bottom, err, end.These are my notes, to get you going * I can claim to have seen Westworld when released in a real theatre. However in a world where today's viewers have the attention span of a bumblebee, that was a long long time ago. Hollywood can remake or re-imagine it if they like. In point of fact, the core idea (seen only in the first 20 minutes, before the film seems to run out of creativity) of redoing it from the POV of the robots (oops, ""artificials"") is bloody clever and deserved much more traction than it got.* did you know Bruce Willis is 60 years old? He has been the backbone of the industry for decades (seems like just yesterday he jumped from MOONLIGHTING to DIE HARD) but he is not getting the plum roles anymore. The real bitter and ugly irony here is that Jane is doing the Willis role and not very well. If you are an alert reviewer, in every scene where Jane and Willis face off (not many) you ache to hit the pause button and imagine what the film would be like if they reversed roles.* Childers is gorgeous. But you knew that. One of the requirements to get the role is that you had to be gorgeous. And if you get trapped in a theatre on a rainy afternoon in Cleveland, there are worse ways to pass the time than to watch a gorgeous actress trying to bootstrap her career to the next level.Those are your starter notes for your review, young scribe.

In Darkness,Only the cop in this movie was decent .... they dint give him much... when i started watching this movie the IMDB ratings was 8/10 .. i was soo angry on IMDB and was never going to trust its review again.. but when i finished watching and went on IMDB to give my rating.. the rating had already dropped down to 5.2 LOL,negative
In Darkness,"Read this only after you've watched the movie and are thinking, what the heck???First clue: she couldn't hear the announcement on the train.Second: She watched the news on TV when buying coffee.Third: She looks at herself in the mirror. Yeah, she really is, in hindsight.Fourth: She knows Veronica and moved downstairs to follow what's going on. She heard what happened because she didn't have her earphones on and was listening. Not clear she saw her fall past the window. Her hearing isn't super sharp.Fifth: when the cop turns around and looks to the back of the room, she looks, too.Sixth: She moves her eyes with purpose at times. They are clear and she doesn't have any of the involuntary movement normally seen.Seventh: she glances around when the brother saves her through the streets.Goes on and on.There are huge plotholes around the devices they used. The inconsistent plothole devices, some explained:She continued her role even at home the better to play her role in public, plus you never who's watching ever. That's why she doesn't look down at Veronica's body. A neighbor could notice if she does.The Serb dude is a bad guy and killed her family. He's running guns through his fake charity. Veronica and the brother and sister team want to bring him down. They want the info that Veronica had. She wants him dead because he killed her Bosnian family.Questions. Some possible answers:
If the brother and Veronica were lovers and working together, why is she acting afraid and kills herself (I believe she did based in the sound of only her footsteps)? Maybe she thought the boyfriend turned on her? Would kill her?The protagonist has nerves of steel. She knows the brother is in the apartment. She doesn't break her role.Inconsistancies: Why when talking to the sister at the party, the brother says he hopes the bad guy didn't kill Veronica if he knew she was pregnant? If the bad guy kill her. Did he lie when he said Veronica killed herself??? Why did the protagonist continue the role when she dropped the bottle? All she had to do was knock over her glass and palm the bottle. Or glance down. Because her back was turned, she wouldn't know if they glanced over. If she dropped something like an earring and started groping for it he might come over to help. Why continue the act while fighting the bad guy in the end? Wouldn't it be a cherry on top to the revenge?Is the street guy in on it? Probably not. Just did a favor giving the brother a scarf.The cop realizes that in the station she saw the pic of the brother, so he knew the truth. One puzzle, everything can't be logically explained. So one may think, was it hysterical? Did she really suddenly realize who the brother was? Well, no, because the flashbacks shows and looked at him at the party. She might not have clearly seen him from elevator, which was lit and he was in darkness. But she didn't she know he was one and the same when he said he was in the apartment with Veronica??? Why wasn't there a police guard on her in the hospital? Why not just walk out of the hospital? If security cameras are checked, it would expose the secret.The movie was good with holding you.

It's Only the End of the World,"A total waste of time. This was the worst film of Marion Cotillard her acting was terrible in that movie. Same for Nathalie Baye. I do not understand why it got an award and was very disappointed by the movie, the way it's being filmed, the way the characters were acting. The movie is long and boring. Dolan did the same thing as always: big close-up, slow motion and 90's music to look original but it actually failed. I regret seeing this movie while I could have done something more interesting. I do not advice people to go. Actresses were deformed with bad performances and they were better directed under other directors. People going out of the cinema were all complaining about how bad the movie was and it's the first time I have seen so many disappointed people.",negative

Yes, there are close-ups and moments of silence. And they all converge into a very deep and touching story (which was the whole purpose!!!) The cast was perfect. The music was perfect. The images were perfect. Xavier Dolan is a genius. He was inspired by the play ""Juste la fin du monde"" but turned it into something completely different.

Mustang,"""I feel the air flowing for life's in full swing, so tell me why I cannot breathe"" ‚Äì Kate Rusby, Fallin' Since the dawn of human history, men's ability to suppress the rights of women has been a measure of their power. Despite our social advances, even today women are often put into categories such as, as author Estela Welldon describes it, ""Mother, Madonna, or Whore."" Accusations of being either cold and prudish or seductive and manipulative obscure the fact that sex for women is as natural and healthy a form of self expression as it is for men. Unfolding against a backdrop of adolescent sexual repression, rebellion, and loss of innocence, Director Deniz Gamze Erg√ºven's magical first feature Mustang tackles the issue of gender inequality that women all over the world have to confront, the title symbolizing their strength and untamed spirit.Co-written by the director and Alice Winocour, the film is set in a rural Turkish village near the Black Sea, and takes place in a conservative patriarchal culture that discourages the expression of femininity other than in fulfilling traditional gender roles. Though Mustang is filmed in Turkey and spoken in Turkish, because France is the director's adopted country, it was France's entry for the Oscars Best Foreign Language Film award in 2016. In the film, five orphaned teenage sisters, Lale (G√ºne≈ü Nezihe ≈ûensoy), Nur (Doƒüa Zeynep Doƒüu≈ülu), Ece (Elit I≈ücan), Selma (Tuƒüba Sunguroƒülu), and Sonay (Ilayda Akdoƒüan) are being raised in the countryside by their uncle Erol (Ayberk Pekcan, ""Winter Sleep"") and their grandmother (Nihal G. Koldas, ""Kuma""). Though sad that their favorite teacher (Bahar Karimoglu) is going to Istanbul, the girls enjoy the final day of their school year, engaging in horseplay with local boys in waist-deep water.Their joyous exuberance is turned into something dirty, however, by a local gossip who accuses them of sexually touching themselves against the boys' necks and, of course, it is the girls who must pay the price. As an innocent game becomes the catalyst for intimidation, the girls are taken one by one by grandma to check their virginity and are subject to beatings from their overbearing uncle. Anything potentially corrupting is taken away such as their cell phones and computers along with their makeup. Expressive, often skimpy outfits are substituted with ugly, shapeless, colorless dresses that destroy their vibrancy.The restrictions become even more blatant after they sneak away to attend a soccer match, even though the crowd is all female (men have been refused entry after a riot). Though Erol didn't see them at the game thanks to a relative who sabotages the electricity to the entire village, their act of rebellion is the last straw for the grandmother. The house becomes a prison as bars are put on the windows and a group of local women arrive to teach the girls cooking and housekeeping in preparation for their preordained role in life as wives and mothers. The situation is promptly described by the feisty Lale who asserts that their home has become a ""wife factory,"" and that their key function will be to produce children.Even sadder, there are darker things going on which are not shown but are implied when we see Uncle Erol going into Nur's room at night, after which the grandmother hides the sheets. Most likely aware of what's going on but powerless to prevent it, she begins to arrange marriages for each one of them. Sonay rebels and insists that she will only marry her boyfriend Ekin (Enes Surum) which is agreed to. Selma, however, is not so fortunate. After her marriage to a boring partner, she is forced to undergo a gynecological examination when there's no blood on the sheets, despite her repeated and truthful assertions that she is a virgin. While the forced marriage plan is partially successful, it leads to tragedy that we are totally unprepared for.Anticipating that she may need to escape this prison before she is also ground down into the passive, compliant woman the family desires, Lale is secretly taught how to drive by Yasin (Burak Yigit, ""Victoria""), a friendly neighborhood truck driver and her thoughts turn to other possibilities. Mustang is marked by outstanding performances by the five sisters who display an intimacy that breathes love and affection. Though the film deals with disturbing subject matter, it is not a depressing film. The remarkable performances by these outstanding young women and the connection they have with each other is exhilarating as is their willingness to assert their individuality and their humanity in the face of ignorance masked by good intentions.",negative
Mustang,"I just saw this movie in a nearly full capacity packed 300 seat theater. Very rarely I rate 10 out of 10, but this piece of film art blew me away from beginning to end, so what more can a viewer expect out of cinema.Five teenagers grow up in a very conservative Turkish village. From early age it is expected that they will marry with a boy the elders prefer, rather than loose themselves in foolish romance. What makes the movie so appealing is the outstanding acting performances of the five teenagers and the realistic way the plot develops. Mustang at the same time offers a laugh and a tear; the viewer is offered the perspective of young ladies growing up, discovering their sexuality and being told that this is a bad thing.Of course some critics will argue that this movie might give viewers a wrong impression about Turkey. This kind of criticism would be the same as stating when a director portrays a story about any kind of bad situation in a certain country, a viewer might get a wrong impression about the country as a whole. This way not one movie should be set in any country in the world because some viewers will always generalize a specific situation.This movie is clearly set in a small rather isolated agricultural village in Turkey; it clearly isn't set in Istanbul (the more modern capital of Turkey). The director also does a very good job of not pointing the finger towards Islam (the main religion in Turkey).What is questioned in this movie is not so much about religion, it is conservatism as a concept which is questioned. A must see movie, one of the best if not the best I've seen in 2015 and the only one I saw in 2015 I rate 10/10.",positive

Down a Dark Hall,"Saw at the theater today. Really enjoyed it. Not your typical teen horror film. Had great acting, atmosphere, cinematography, and sound design. Even gave me a couple jumps, but that's not what this film is ultimately about. Would have been a 10/10 if the second act was a little more developed and had a stronger friendship/relationship between the girls. Thought the adults, Uma Thurman and the actress that played Kit's mom were great. At first I thought Uma Thurman's accent was going to throw me, but ended up liking it. This film has a cool concept at the end. Be patience. But may not be great for those with short attention spans, ADD, or lack of depth. Definitely not your typical teen movie, nor is it your typical horror film. Has an artsy feel to it and could be something that gets more attention later as these actresses careers take off.",positive
No Good Deed,Look here is the skinny on this flick. It is so predictable I found myself saying out loud (but quietly) what was going to happen next. I mean really people can't these Hollywood money men find some better quality movies to get behind to finance. Let's not forget this movie as all the rest are a business. The business of INVESTING cash to produce a movie with the hopes you will spend your entertainment dollars seeing it so it makes them millions in profit. Don't let them make money on this one or we will never get them to stop producing trash and fooling us into thinking it's worth the price of a ticket and $15.00 popcorn. Plot plot plot help me find something entertaining about this movie that we don't know is going to happen before it happens. The acting is average and if an academy award ever makes it to this movie it will be because somebody paid somebody! Don't waste your money on this film you will be disappointed. Go see Denzel instead!!!! :-),negative
No Good Deed,"Even after having watched the trailer you'll be in for lots of surprises. There were a few things I didn't see coming, subtle twists and turns which caught me off guard. Idris and Taraji have great chemistry on screen, you want to watch them and you don't get bored watching them.I love to see films with black people in them, which have nothing to do with race or where race isn't even mentioned once. You literally could have placed any one from any ethnic background in any of those characters and it would have worked.This movie re-enforced to me that Taraji and Idris are really good actors, I got my money's worth. I went to see the movie at the Grove where there are lots of tourists and people from all over the country, who have normal reactions to what they see on the screen. The audience as a whole cared a lot about Taraji's character, they cheered for her when she was winning and they had natural human responses that were real, and so at the end of the day, that says to me all the people involved in making this movie did their job. Seeing the film there got me avoiding the jaded Hollywood movie ""experts"" on cinema with their snobby intellectual bully b.s, I was with regular people at a movie theater, the reason actors make movies to begin with, the people who are funding our industry with their hard earned dollars, not movie critics who go the movies for intellectual stimulation instead of reading a freaking book. You're gonna like Taraji's bff, she has a great moment with Idris that has everyone who has a best friend going ""YOU TELL IT."" I personally love to go see a movie and turn off my brain and enjoy myself and you get to do this with this movie, it kept my attention from beginning to end. Go see it, worth your money!",positive
Breaking In,"Bad acting, bad story, bad thriller, bad everything.",negative
Breaking In,"The movie about someone saving their family members has been done to death? So has every other subject. It's the storyline, script, and execution that make this good.The movie is straight to the point. The violence in this movie is relevant to the storyline, and not excessive. Shaun's (Gabrielle Union) main goal is getting her kids out of the house. She tries to reason with them. Tells them they can have the money: she doesn't care. Just so long as they let Glover and Jaz out of the house. Violence is used only as a last resort.I find the best movies are the ones where you can connect/empathize with even the bad guys, as you can with Sam's character in this movie. He's a thief, a criminal, but he's not a murderer. He at least had some intention of doing the right thing in the movie.Ajiona Alexus is a great actress. She nails the role of a teenage girl. I also saw her in Tyler Perry's Acrimony, where she played a different type of character, and nailed that role, so she's not one of those typecast actresses who can only play one role. I hope to see her in more movies.",positive
Table 19,"Trailers are notorious in over-promising for movies that under-deliver. But every now and then, one pops up that does the opposite. The trailer for Table 19 (2017) gives the impression of a lightweight romantic comedy with a touch of slapstick, all framed around a wedding. Despite being critically panned by many, there is more to this unexpectedly entertaining low-profile film than meets the eye.The heroine is Eloise (Anna Kendrick) who, against her better judgement, accepts a wedding invitation knowing she is persona non-grata with the bridal party. She was recently dumped by the bride's brother, who is now the best man, and she is suddenly no longer the bride's best friend. She was the chief helper with the reception planning and knows who is at every table and why they are here. Her companions on Table 19 comprise a lovable granny-type, two oddballs, and a quarrelling married couple. They were all expected to decline their invitation but still send a gift, and that alone is a recipe for humour and satire. Their distance from the bridal table and proximity to the toilets quickly establishes their lowly social status and the comic sketches play on social awkwardness. The thread of continuity is through Eloise and her manhunts. The standard sit-com one-liners and the obligatory near-catastrophe with a wedding cake are neither original nor particularly funny, but the situation develops a warm emotional undercurrent that is unexpectedly touching.One of the interesting things about this film is the difference between its plot and story. The plot is standard wedding reception comedy which laughs at the marginalisation of unwanted guests. On the other hand, the story explores why the Table 19'ers are together. It offers insight into their lives, their personalities, and the emotional hurt caused by being placed on the social fringe. The best part of the film is when the offended ""randoms"" leave the reception for a while to console each other. Through flashbacks we get the back-story to their invitations which range from pathetic to comic. For example, the granny-type really believed she was invited because the bride fondly remembered her first baby-sitter, but the bride barely knows who she is. There is also a wannabe trying to lose his virginity, a weird guy straight out of prison, and a couple who are far from an inspiring example of a loving marriage.Anna Kendrick plays the perfect balance between awkward, aggrieved, and aggressive, and the randoms are standard comic stereotypes. But while our eyes are on Elosie, the warmth of the story come from her table companions. The gags are at snicker level rather than belly laughs and the cinematography is colourful and cluttered as wedding receptions often are. There is no shortage of embarrassing moments as Eloise stalks her men, both old and new, and the final scenes rise through melodrama to operatic farce. But this film offers a fresh take on standard rom-com themes in amusing and entertaining ways¬Ö. and it might make you think twice if you need to create a seating plan.",negative
Table 19,"I confess I find weddings tedious at the best of times but we always go with a sense of optimism.Anna Kendrick's character was clearly on the fence about attending but decided to be brave and attend. She is seated at the table of people who were surprised to get an invitation and we learn that she is the best man's ex-girlfriend and former Maid of Honour for this event.Nobody beautiful, rich or influential is at table 19. It turns out they are all at a turning point in their lives and the story evolves about their various crisis.These people are all amazing in their on right and their stories are interesting (far more interesting than any the beautiful people have).#The soundtrack is well chosen and the spark of sensuality provided when Huck and Eloise dance is well done.The wedding isn't dressed up as a great event - its an ordinary American wedding and thankfully, there is a limited amount of it.I can't recommend it highly enough, in a time when films have no script at all",positive
Little Evil,"There's very ""little"" good to say about this snore-fest. It tries to be funny but falls flat at every turn. Even the great, villainous Clancy Brown as the evil cult leader couldn't salvage this train wreck. The morbidly obese lesbian ""AL"" character dropped the F-Bomb every other word and was incredibly irritating as she called every male ""Bro!"" (in between F-Bombs). The mother was completely oblivious to the fact her son had brought complete destruction to all those around him, especially slaughtering former husbands and boyfriends. And the step-dad took forever and a ton of prodding to be convinced the kid (Lucas) was actually the anti-Christ.
And then, after being tortured and buried alive by Lucas, the step-dad gets chewed out by the mom for not caring for the emotional well-being of the pint-sized, psychotic, satanic little monster!?! Yeah, then the step-dad has some unequivocally idiotic change of heart and decides he's gonna love this murderous demon ""because you don't have to be like your real dad"" or some kinda BS even though Lucas has ALREADY committed countless atrocities and deaths! It ends on an even cheesier, dumb note that I won't even bother to explain. If you want a funny, scary movie you'd be much better served watching ""Army of Darkness"" again.",negative
Little Evil,"This film is hilariously entertaining if you recognize the intended allusions, particularly the nods to THE OMEN. Adam Scott and Owen Atlas are charming as step-father and son, especially in the water park scenes. Evangeline Lilly is surprisingly perfect as the ditsy mom; she delivers her lines with impeccable comic timing. I've never seen her outside of LOST and her performance here is spot-on. Yes, some bits are campy and silly, but the overall message is touching and relevant.",positive
Hell Fest,"Please, do not watch this movie. The only positive thing about this film is the set design.

Hell Fest,"Just got home from seeing it. I love thursday night early showings! Got to see it without a crowd. I'm a seasoned horror fan so the fact this didn't scare me doesn't mean anything. Not much scares me. The fact that the suspense and tension were felt throughout and kept me wanting to see what happens next, thats a good accomplishment. I was pretty impressed with this flick.A great addition to the slasher genre, I hope there are sequels. I don't want to give anything away but will say it had a great 80s/90s slasher feel to it, I loved some of the tropes included, it made if fun.

Acting : terrible enough to be enjoyable, and right to very realist
Shooting : double Dop for a double feature, both work fine to obtain the right result, a funny horror result.

Big Game,"""Not political, not religious. He is just a certified grade-A psychopath."" I thought ""Why the hell not ?"" after seeing the poster of ""Big Game"". An adventure film, clearly aimed at a younger audience, with Air Force One crashing down somewhere in a Finnish forest and with the US president trying to saving himself with the help of a Finnish boy who just happens to undergo a local ritual so he can prove himself to the male population. And after I saw that Samuel L. Jackson also took part in this movie as the missing president, I didn't hesitate for a second. It's true that Jackson played some minor roles before this (""Oldboy"", ""Reasonable Doubt"" and ""Robocop""), yet I was pleasantly surprised by his last performance in ""Kingsman: The secret service"". So I went on the assumption that this was going to be a likable youth film, full of unabashed and not too far-fetched action.Boy oh boy. I didn't expect this to be such a crappy movie full of improbabilities, ridiculous situations and coincidences. Admittedly, it's indeed aiming for a younger audience, filled with teenage boys, who can have nice dreams that same night after watching such a film and imagine themselves acting as such a hero. But I'm convinced that most of them will shake their heads out of disapproval, while wondering if the makers of this film actually were convinced that they are really so naive.First lets start with the positive aspects. The scenery is matchless and breathtaking beautiful. I had no idea that Finland looked like that and I was tempted immediately to choose this country as a destination for my next holiday. Onni Tommila, a youthful Finnish actor, performed properly and does his job as the Finnish guide Oskari remarkably well. The entire film is clearly a homage to earlier films with youthful heroism as a central theme. It's a kind of film like ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" in which Short Round plays a prominent role or a typical Spielberg film like ""Empire of the Sun"". It brings back the nostalgia of fathers going to the cinema with their son to enjoy a cool film for guys. A prerequisite for such films is that the youthful contribution should smoothly transcend the ingenuity of the adults. In other words, the adults are presented as utter fools.What bothered me the most about this movie, were the totally absurd situations that arose. I admit, when you look at it from the perspective of a young person and you don't take it too serious, it comes across as an entertaining movie. A sort of ""Home Alone"" in a forest, where you're always a bit smarter and faster than the bad guys. But there are limits. Firstly I would like to purchase the brand of freezer they used here, because I think this high-tech-wonder-equipment is indestructible. Swinging under a helicopter, mowing through the woods, tumbling from a mountain, splashing into a lake and afterwards popping up out of the water like a purebred Russian submarine. And this ""undamaged"" ! Now that's what I call solid quality. But beware ! Make sure you don't end up inside this miracle appliance, because apparently it can't be opened from the inside. The number of accidental meetings is huge. Coincidentally, the probe with the POTUS is landing where Oskari made his camp. The freezer pops out of the water where Air Force One incidentally crashed. And you just need to follow a suspicious helicopter on satellite, and you end up looking at POTUS. The criminal Hazar (Mehmet Kurtulus) apparently isn't such a hot-shot criminal afterall, because he doesn't even know how to load an automatic rifle. And the way the satellite images are used in the Pentagon to follow the president, is just hilarious.I admit, It shouldn't always be that serious and occasionally a lightly youth film is also welcome, but there are limits to follies and ridiculous situations. As a boy I'd fall for this blindly. But as an adult, who started watching this film unprepared, it gradually began to annoy me more and more because of the series of stupidities. The final image full of patriotism and heroism ultimately, was a bit too much for me.You gotta cock it, Motherf ¬Ö. Oops.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",negative

Austenland,"Did you ever watch the first five minutes of a movie, and realize that for every ten more minutes you watched, your IQ would drop eleven points? Austenland is such a movie. When Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dumber were standing there at the airport and the ""nineteenth century"" taxi arrived, I knew if I saw the rest of this film I would wind up brain-dead. It isn't funny, except in ways that awful movies are funny in an unintended sort of way. In other words the writing, acting and directing are so bad you laugh your tutu off. Austenland is such a movie. There are wonderful comedies out there, fantastic period dramas and historical masterpieces. Austenland is not one of them. Avoid!",negative
Austenland,"I am not sure why this film has received such low reviews. The film opens up with Mrs. Wattlesbrook (Jane Seymour) holding a fake lamb and talking about Austenland, which I think greatly sets the tone for what type of movie this is going to be. Going into the film, I knew it had received a low score thus lowering my expectations greatly so I wasn't expecting much. It turns out I didn't need to lower my expectations, this film totally went over and above.The critics and everyone leaving a low score have no sense of humor! It's over the top, exaggerated, hilarious, ridiculous, it's supposed to be that way! None of it is believable and once you allow yourself to enter the world of Austenland, you'll enjoy the film. The theater possibly has a lot to do with the tone. We had a great audience, everyone was cracking up, loud uproars in all the scenes, it was hilarious. Miss Elizabeth Charming is hysterical! I really enjoyed Jennifer Coolidge's performance, she really did her usual thing and it was wonderful. Lady Amelia Heartwright, Colonel Andrews, Captain George East all are so ridiculous and entertaining. The actors all did an amazing job. I honestly have not laughed that hard in a film in a long time. I'm talking laugh out loud, bursting, crying, snort kind of laughing. Even my husband enjoyed himself and found many of the scenes very entertaining.I know I haven't talked much about the actual movie but bottom line: it's HILARIOUS. Go in with an open mind, allow yourself to be silly, let go of how ""unrealistic"" it is, and you'll be in for a treat.",positive
The Breadwinner,"The beauty about discovering independent animated films outside of America is that you discover gems that could never be made here. In the case of today's film, it comes from the Irish studio Cartoon Saloon, known for making The Secret of Kells and Song of the Sea. Although the film did go under the radar outside of getting an Oscar nom and premiering at TIFF in 2017, it's still regarded as a beloved feature amongst critics and film fans. What could have easily been done in live-action ends up working well in the other medium to really bring to life the turmoil in Afghanistan through pure artistry.The Breadwinner focuses on a little girl named Parvana who lives under the Taliban rule in Afghanistan. After her father is arrested without charge, Parvana disguises herself as a boy to support her family, whilst working alongside a friend of hers named Shauzia. As a lead, Parvana helps drive the film forward so she can save her loved ones, and the stakes that come from living in such an oppressive country make us sympathize with her. That being said, there is a sense of optimism displayed through both her and Shauzia, as they cleverly trick the hierarchy who view them as boys. It's also neat how the filmmakers made Parvana feel relatable by displaying her home life that shows as many sibling rivalries and issues as the average family.It's neat how even though the film details many hardships, it also has several moments of sweetness and levity. The film sporadically showcases a story told by Parvana that ends up connecting to all the events happening to her, and it does it in a way where we want to know how it all ends. In terms of dark content, the film does not shy away from displaying the violence, evil from the order and even bits of war to heighten up Parvana's desperation and risk taking. However, there are still moments of soothing relaxation, especially whenever Parvana tells her story, allowing the viewers to digest the severely tense moments. While they can interrupt the main narrative's flow sometimes, it's still cool to see the contrast between the harsh reality and uplifting fantasy displayed in this film.Cartoon Saloon outdid themselves with their previous features in terms of animation, and this film is no exception. The overall Middle-eastern inspired designs of the film create a very stylish and angular hand-drawn feel that's become so rare to find nowadays. In addition, another notable contrast is how the film emulates reality in Parvana's state of being. In contrast, the stories she tells are presented in a more abstract and storybook illustrative aesthetic that gives one the impression they are viewing an ancient narrative. Where the real world is murky, grainy and filled with bright lights and grim shadows, the surreal worlds of the story display a very versatile amount of colors, designs and characters to utilize the much needed creativity from a storyteller.Although by no means a happy go lucky film, The Breadwinner succeeds very well in telling a narrative through the harsh realities of growing up in a dangerous country filled with oppression and prejudice. If you haven't seen this film yet, definitely check it out. It works as a story of feminism, it works as a blend of differing mediums shown throughout different states of reality, and it especially works as a biting tale on surviving in a country filled with tyrannical cruelty. This is the kind of underrated gem that demands a larger audience, so it can go on to become a cult classic and then a beloved film by more than just animation buffs. If Cartoon Saloon keeps pushing themselves to making more unique and great content like this, I think they're in for a wonderful future.",negative
The Breadwinner,"This movie gets a perfect score for me, but it's not for everyone.Recently I saw many movies and even animated movies. But they were all made to impress in cheap ways such as huge stakes, awesome CGI and well known actors. The Breadwinner for me does so much more with so much less.This movie however is about characters you wouldn't normally care about. About a story so far from your living room that you wont bother to check. And yet, this is why it touched me. It's a realistic take of a distant world. The characters and situations are as down to earth as possible, even compared to live action movies. The soul this movie has, with the small stakes of a poor family and even how a girl copes with the loss of her brother, is what most directors and writers fail to deliver. The movie gives many cultural elements of how an Afgan family lives, how men differ from women and how the whole city works. I had to check and see if everything depicted in the movie was real in some way. This was a fictional story but so well crafted that left me stunned. I thought it could be a biography like the 10 year old cartoon movie Persepolis (which has similar style and setting) but it's not.The description of this movie ""an 11-year-old girl who cuts off her hair and dresses like a boy to support her family"", put me off at first because it reminded me of Mulan. This may not be a blockbuster but it is a superior film made by a smaller company.",positive
The Boxtrolls,"This visually impressive stop-motion animated movie plays like a twist on H.G. Wells' classic The Time Machine: its underground-dwelling Morlocks - here a diminutive race called Boxtrolls - are harmless critters with a penchant for steampunk, unjustly feared and discriminated by their smug Eloi - here the class-obsessed citizens of Cheesebridge. A boy adopted by the creatures, with the help of a surface girl, fights against ruthless town exterminator Snatcher, who plans to destroy the Boxtrolls.The vocal talent assembled here is impressive; as much as I like Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, Elle Fanning and Isaac Hempstead-Wright (Game of Thrones' Bran), the standout is an unrecognizable Ben Kingsley in a magnificently loathsome, scene-stealing turn as Snatcher.Much like the authors' previous work Coraline, this isn't for small children. It's not as creepy as their brilliant Gaiman adaptation, but it features a certain amount of grotesque moments - like a character's face horribly swollen after an allergic reaction - not really suited to toddlers.7/10",negative
The Boxtrolls,"The film Boxtrolls is so jam packed with themes that cut to the core of our society that you might expect it to be cobbled together, choppy, overreaching, and pretentious. It is, in fact, none of those things.A thoroughly entertaining, not too cerebral, romp down one box conveyor after another, the film succeeds at wrapping it's central theme of persecution and prejudice in layers of equally significant ideas: group self-identification, class ambition, dalliant obsessions, self-esteem, and self-destructive addiction. It follows a nicely predictable plot arc that will satisfy your children while you ponder whether the plucky heroine's ostensible obsession with the macabre is likely a reflection of a Freudian complex with roots in her father's indifference. The bad guy with his crooked teeth and greazy hair is unmistakably evil. But at the same time the good guys aren't wearing the white hats. In fact, it's comparing and poking fun at both incompetence and maliciousness.The animation finds it's grounding in a setting that is reminiscent of Corpse Bride. From the industrial green palate of the box trolls to the stiff and starched characterization of the patrician class, the visual design of the film holds together well.After the film you'll walk out of the theater with lots of things on your mind, but you won't be walking out with a child who was bored to sleep or fits by another didactic feature of animated hogwash. That is an impressive achievement for any film.",positive
21 & Over,"Watched ""21 and Over"" last night at an advanced screening so sharing a review for those wondering about it.If you should use other films/media to describe ""21 and Over"", it is like a combination of ""Hang Over"", ""American Pie"", and ""Jackass"". If describing in one sentence, ""21 and Over"" is stupid drunkenness or drunk galore? It is an enjoyable film and I would recommend it for those who enjoy dirty slapstick humor and just college craziness. I wouldn't feel the need to watch this film again and it isn't an Oscar nominee type of film, but If you like watching drunk people, this film is for you.I admit, I like watching this type of films from time to time, but a big reason I was interested in this film was because I liked the writers' Jon Lucas and Scott Moore's other pieces, the popular ""Hang Over"" film series and ""Change Up"". I did assume that ""21 and Over"" would be structured and directed just like ""Hang Over but ""21 and Over"" does not have the story-telling abilities that ""Hang Over"" has nor are the story, plot, resolution, and characters anywhere as interesting. One's own experiences and perspectives change with age, and Lucas and Moore are out of touch with the current 20s generation as the dialogue, story development, and characters in ""21 and Over"" are old, clich√©d, and stereotypical.The movie took a while to pick up the pace. Surprisingly and thankfully Jeff Chang is not the main focus in this film, nothing against the actors (these newcomers did a great job), but the supposed main character burned through his drinking and bar scenes early on in a series of montages.Some of the likable aspects of this movie are the timing of the stunts and how outrageous the stunts are. When it seemed like the film would end soon or run out of tricks, the characters' rolling ball of chaos just got bigger and bigger. The stunts pulled now a day for slapstick humor are getting more outrageous and openly, visually sexual. If nothing, Lucas and Moore get kudos for fresh stunts. Perhaps they spent the time they were supposed to use for brainstorming dialogue and story development, watching ""Jackass"" instead.In the end this film is still enjoyable because it's not like this film's audience watches these kinds of films for the dialogue nor accurate representation of cultural identities. All that matters is that the slapstick stunts and moderate dirtiness of the film is enough to not leave a silent house. For sure, the high school kids during the advanced screening got a kick out of it, hoping their college life can be that fun? Crazy at least.Review by WendyXS@FeiXiangFilms",negative
21 & Over,The character of Miles is the most annoying person on the planet. Horribly acted by the actor who plays Jeff Chang. Nothing he says comes off as believable. The dialogue between Sarah Wright and the other male lead is horribly written.Not only is this movie not funny; it is a very predictable story line. Caution! you will see two of the male leads make-out.How people rate this movie above 5 is beyond me.They joke about incest in the beginning of the movie also. I would be embarrassed to even be associated with this movie. This is worst movie i've seen in a while.,positive
Fifty Shades of Black,"After weeks of being teased by the trailer I was so excited to see this film! I was expecting 50 Shades Of Grey meets Scary Movie- you know, a parody that actually worked. But I couldn't have been more wrong. It was more 50 Shades Of Shite. Five minutes in to the film and I knew i'd spend the remaining 1 hour 27 minutes with my palm on my forehead, cringing for my life at it's stupidity.The film had potential to be very funny but the idea was crushed by the terrible acting, and pathetic excuse for dark humor. I can account for the two times, throughout the whole movie, I let out a slight giggle- well it was more of a scoff but at least it triggered some kind of emotion eh. As a kid I loved the Haunted House and Marlon Wayans was brilliant in it; I think this is why I expected great things. I think he should stick to his PG rating films. It's crude sexual content contained stereotypical 'humor' that could be considered racist towards African American's and many people could take offence. I find it offensive that we are expected to pay as much as ¬£5 to watch this. Watching paint dry is more entertaining. I was counting down the painful minutes, praying for the movie to end. When it did, sheer disappointment and disgust was how I was left feeling about this movie. This film is a waste of time and a waste of a cinema slot.",negative
Fifty Shades of Black,"Hard to believe Florence Henderson's and Jane Seymour would agree to be a part of this movie. It always bothers me when actors and actresses who, after having long and successful careers, lower themselves and take parts in awful films like this. The first thing I think is how disparate they must me to work again. Same thing goes for well-established actors who appear in commercials. If they totally blew all the money they earned during their careers, ok they need a job. But most haven't and are simply earning a nice fat paycheck from a sponsor. Florence Henderson died shortly after this movie came out and was the last film in which she appeared. Sad her last appearance was on such a low note. And I would think Jane Seymour would just be embarrassed.",positive
The Nut Job,"Before I begin berating this film, I would just like to preface that I would have considered it warranting of a 1 had it not been for the sufficing animation quality. This film is everything amiss about the cinema consolidated into one grotesque, insufferable mess. The pacing shows a stark lack of energy essential to this kind of film, which leaves the audience constantly expecting some kind of climax that the film never really manages to deliver, it's encumbered with purposeless characters and unexplained plot events (most notably a certain elderly character's antipathy for a dog whistle). In addition (as if everything previously mentioned weren't enough) the film has a completely incongruous scene in which the characters begin euphorically dancing to Gangnam Style, as well as a gimmicky, overdone dancing credits sequence involving the presence of a computer animated Psy for no explicable reason. Usually films tend to show a vestige of concern for subtlety when resorting to demographic pandering, though, this film just suffocates you with it.So, in short, unless you're searching for some ludovico technique material, avoid this film like the plague.",negative
The Nut Job,"This movie is pretty cool. It is funny and has a good amount of action. It is really good and I think you would like it too.This movie is all about a squirrel named Surly who, at the beginning, fends for himself and only himself (with his friend Buddy) until his actions contribute to the burning of the large tree where all the squirrels live, along with what little food they have left. He is banished to the city and soon finds a shop full of nuts. He makes a deal with another squirrel named Andie that he would get half and they would get half. They run into a lot of obstacles such as mouse traps, rats, guns and people.The main characters in the movie are Surly (Will Arnett), King (Stephen Lang), Grayson (Brendan Fraser), Raccoon (Liam Neeson), Andie (Katherine Heigl) and Precious (Maya Rudolph). My favorite character in this movie is Precious because she is such a funny dog and helps Surly and loves him after a while. She is also really funny.My favorite part in the movie is when Surly and Buddy meets Precious because, as I said she is my favorite character, and she is so funny. She thinks she has to hate the squirrels because her owners don't want animals in their shop but she soon realizes she loves them. She starts showing them tricks likes fetching, playing dead, sitting and she thinks that her tail is amazing because it wiggles a lot. She says it has a mind of its own! I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this movie for ages 4 to 10 because it is really suitable for a younger audience. I think younger kids will really love it.

Curse of Chucky,"Curse of Chucky is better than most horror movies that get a theatrical run. The staging is rather small, with a small unknown cast and a limited location, but they make the absolute best of everything they have. Brad Dourif, the original director, and another important cast member from parts 4 and 5 appear; and this movie actually seems like a return to the formula of the original movies, using some of the surprise and humor of the last two. A woman caring for a disabled daughter, and living in a lovely Gothic mansion, receives the Chucky doll anonymously. After being quickly dispatched, the rest of the family arrives to take over the estate from the daughter. Among them is a little girl, who adopts the Chucky doll. The parents of the girl seem to have ulterior motives and a strange relationship with their babysitter, which is later revealed as a pleasant and humorous twist. Chucky begins killing off the victims, using the creepy mansion as a great backdrop. The camera work is great. The suspense is good. There are some great kills. This movie does not look cheap. Its only VOD concession seems to be that it sticks to the same location over the same night, and changes settings only rarely. The last entry seems to largely avoid parts 4 and 5, although it does not erase them completely. Often, horror movies that deviate from formula come out disastrous, but Chucky reinvented itself as a series with Bride and Seed of. Fans of those movies may be disappointed this doesn't pick right up where they left off. Still, it's a nice surprise to go back to the pure cheesy formula horror of the first three movies. The ending, of course, leaves room for a sequel that could play off the theme of the movie, and revisit dangling threads from the earlier series. Well worth renting, streaming, buying.",negative
Curse of Chucky,"Do NOT underestimate this movie. Just because it's going straight-to-DVD does not mean it will be ""another terrible sequel"". This movie contains twists, gore, and so much scare, you will most likely jump out of your seat more than once. AND not only will this movie have you begging for another, this movie will PROMISE you another. Chucky has been around since the 80's but now it's time for a revamp. And while some of the Chucky models especially in this movie might look a tad awkward, this doll will eventually evolve into one of the most horrifying icons that has startled people for decades. Chucky is back, better than ever, and one hell of a killer doll!",positive
The Sacrament,"Wow...I can't believe this movie averages 6 stars. I went into it thinking something scary was going to happen. Halfway through, I realize the plot is pretty much Jim Jones and Jonestown. ""Ok,"" I say to myself, ""maybe there is a plot twist and they all turn into zombies or something clever.""Nope. Basically whoever scripted this pile of crap plagiarized the Wikipedia page for Jamestown. , changed some names, added some Shakey-Cam, pretended like it was found footage, and added a terrible score.I was expecting a lot more. An actual documentary on The Jamestown Massacre is more terrifying than this movie. The saddest part of all is in the credits where, instead giving a tribute to the actual Jamestown Massacre victims, they continue with the fauxmentary falsehoods with the body counts and other BS about ""Eden Parish.""Save your time, avoid this movie.",negative
The Sacrament,"For those of you that are saying, ""You'd be better off watching 'Jonestown: Life and Death in the People's Temple.'"" I mean...you're not necessarily wrong, but saying so diminishes some of what I thought was really clever about this film: the found footage format.In Guyana (as they say multiple times in the documentary you are all so well defending), Jim Jones talked all the time over the loudspeaker and TAPED everything. I think the found footage angle on this film pays an interesting tip of the hat to that aspect of Jonestown life. The reason we know so much about what happened in the massacre is: A. The congressmen brought a film crew with him and we have footage from them and B. Jim Jones audio-taped the mass suicide. Those that survived the shooting at the airstrip took the film with them. The audiotape was discovered at the site of the massacre. (Therefore, it's not really problematic that in this film, one of the cameras was left behind). Did I feel like the FF angle felt forced at times? Of course! But I've seen it done WAY more awkwardly in other films, I just have to give this one credit. I thought the movie was inspired and paid tribute to many Jonestown victims throughout(i.e. the guy speaking out against Father in the meeting, the note slipped to the media). It's really hard to recreate something so tragic without feeling campy, especially in the horror genre and I think they did a good job. I do wish that (as in Guyana), a few of the cult members actually survived and escaped with them, I'm not terribly sure why they chose to eradicate everyone. But...in all, I enjoyed it.",positive
"Two Days, One Night","Marion Cotillard has reflected so many various emotions like weakness, sadness, anxiety, instability and happiness easily and perfectly.
Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne have put her in a difficult situation with their choice about taking most of the scenes with long take and she passed this perfectly.
She has reached the perfectionism in this movie. Come on she have even acted with her BREATH!Life can not have win-win situations, this philosophy was represented ably by Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne cinematic tools in such a great story that shows our main character struggles to make people vote for her job against 14 person who have their own reasons to vote for dismissing her and get 1,000 EUR as a reward.
The ingenuity of the script is that we can not say that people who will vote for the reward that they're greedy or selfish. Absolutely no, they literally fight for their survival in the life.Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne have succeed in choosing their directing tools.
Like they have succeed in delivering a lot of emotions without an important dramatic tool like the music and they replaced it with the background noises and that added more realism to the scenes.
Also the shaky camera had a message that the characters have instability.",negative
"Two Days, One Night","I've never been a fan of Darwinian theory: why interfere when mother nature will straighten out the weak? Not especially after watching this simple, yet powerful film.The Dardennes do not make make morality tales. Even though their characters navigate practical dilemmas that challenge their moral stance. This moral stance in turn, corresponds with realities in which these characters exist ‚Äî it is a ramification of larger economic forces that govern the poor and working-class. It is with that in mind, that the Dardenne's narrative strategy reflects neorealist tradition and normative ethics. The main point has always been for us, the audience, to observe the conditions in these characters' daily lives, how they conduct themselves or negotiate problems and resolve dilemmas. In a Dardenne film, we're allowed to engage unobtrusively, without passing judgements on what they choose and how they arrive at those choices eventually.Two Days, One Night is set against the backdrop of an industrial town in Li√®ge, Belgium. Sandra Bya (Marion Cotillard) is a working-class wife and mother who earns her living in a solar panel factory. After a nervous breakdown, she is forced to take a break from work. The duration of her absence isn't known to viewers, but sufficient for supervisor Mr. Dumont to notice it was possible to cover Sandra's work if all 16 workers pulled an extra 3-hours per shift.Soon, the factory's management proposes ¬Ä1,000 bonus to each staff if they agree to make Sandra redundant. By the time Sandra returns to work and knows what happened, majority of her co-workers had opted for the bonus. Factory foreman Jean-Marc influenced their votes by saying if Sandra wasn't laid off, maybe they (her co- workers) would be. Regardless, her fate has been sealed via democratic means.Concerned friend and colleague Juliette appeals to Mr. Dumont and negotiates a secret snap ballot. Everyone will vote first thing Monday morning ‚Äî will they choose the ¬Ä1,000 bonus or Sandra? Because the factory's management surely could not afford both.Two Days, One Night refers to the weekend: rest days where hard workers retreat in comfort to the sanctuary of their homes and private lives. When Sandra is forced to intrude people's lives on a precious weekend, visit each and every one of her 16 co-workers in a bid to change their minds before Monday (I use the word ""forced"" because clearly, Sandra was embarrassed and reluctant to do it), at one point she laments in self-disgust saying ""I can't stand it. Every time I feel like a beggar, a thief coming to take their money. They look at me ready to hit me. I feel like hitting them too."" But kitchen worker and husband Manu urges with maturity and understanding, ""You have to fight for your job."" Both knew Sandra cannot quite walk away and abandon work at the small factory. The family of four has just recently moved out of public housing. Sandra needs the minimum wage job to keep their heads above the water, to keep from going back to welfare assistance.Much of the film has Manu drive Sandra around the small town of Li√®ge, as the 48-hours clock goes ticking down with growing intensity. The first dilemma is presented as she goes knocking door- to-door, trying to convince fellow employees to give up a salary bonus that they too, badly need. Times are hard and money is tight, her interactions with each co-worker and their subsequent response to her plea is compelling to watch. Lesser film-makers will settle with a cookie cutter protagonist in need of sympathy, but this isn't the case with Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne.There is a real sense here that the space and reality of this film has the relevance of modern social-political commentary. ""Will you vote for me?"" ‚Äî the same question when asked repeatedly, becomes illuminated by varying personal realities. Thus allowing the audience to consider the same situation with changing arguments and evolving perspectives. Every step of the way, the audience absorbs a broad spectrum of humanity as reactions toward Sandra ricochet between doubt and certainty: selfish and cruel, unapologetic and indifferent, defensive and guilt-ridden, conflicted and hesitant, kind and compassionate. At one point, it had me wondering if Sandra, for the sake of some colleagues so dangerously close to the margins of poverty, probably shouldn't be appealing at all ‚Äî after all, their knapsacks are so much tinier and more fragile than the sling bag draped across her hunched, bony shoulders.All the above reflects just one, out of several more thought experiments found in the plot design. One particular sub-plot examines Sandra's level of resilience as a recovering depressive, and culminates in an episode involving a box of Xanax. Here, Marion Cotillard turns in her role with master class technique ‚Äî she applies subdued, matter-of-fact emotional tone with the kind of authenticity and resignation made possible only by an exhausted, dehumanized, defeated soul. Less is accurately more. When I saw L'Infant at the Alliance Fran√ßaise de Singapour back in 2005; I was a young adult in her early twenties with the intellectual capital and moral patience of a fish. Coming out of my first experience with the Dardennes, my opinion towards main character Bruno, was straight forward and quite simply, disapproving ‚Äî what kind of person sells his own newborn child for a meagre sum of money? I left the small theatre with obvious answers and a snap conclusion, partially dissatisfied and disappointed with the film's ridiculous premise.Nearly a decade has passed and now having watched Two Days, One Night; I find myself weighing all variables in the complex social totality embodied by one simple observation: ""Some people are so rich they don't know what it means to live with so little."" I no longer believe in moral absolutes with the reckless naivet√© of a youth. What an honest, complex and thought provoking film. How wide-ranging and realistic.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",positive
Paddleton,When it works it really works a few genuine laugh out loud moments and a few perfectly sombre moments also. Overall though if I'm honest it did struggle to keep my attention and I did find the second half to drag a little despite two strong performances from the leads I just felt it needed a little more to actually be anything more than above average.,negative
Paddleton,"I had the privilege of watching the world premiere at Sundance. It's a poignant story of friendship between two men who have chosen to live a simple, uncomplicated life. At first I felt sad for these characters, who seemed to be just existing. But as the story moved along, what at first seemed mundane became a sense of comfortable routine. When faced with a terminal diagnosis for Michael, the pair embarks on a stoic journey through his final chapter. Along the way they reveal parts of themselves that were previously muted. Watching them maneuver the stages of grief, while knowing what the final outcome will be is heart wrenching. By the final scenes I was openly sobbing. The performances by Mark Duplass and Ray Romano pulled out a whole gamut of emotions. I found myself at various times laughing out loud, occasionally slightly uncomfortable, unendingly empathetic, and often sad. This is why I love movies, especially ones as beautifully made as this.",positive

Super Troopers 2,"If you are in the mood for a deep, spiritual experience, this is not the movie for you. If you have no sense of humor, this is likewise not for you. If, however, the idea of 100 minutes of pure unadulterated fun sounds good, then you should definitely go see Super Troopers 2.

The Prince,"My wife and I are huge John Cusak and Bruce Willis fans. This was such a terrible movie that we just had to keep watching in disbelief! There was NOTHING professional about this movie: the writing was a joke, the directing was so bad that we promised each other to keep our eyes out for this director in the future ( if he EVER directs another movie again), so that we NEVER watch another movie he might direct. The acting was awful, but I cannot blame the actors for this. The directing was actually so horrible that he destroyed the performances of John Cusack and Bruce Willis????? How much of an idiot can someone be to pull THAT off? I've never acted or directed anything but I guarantee I could have done a much better job. This director could have done better if he had just shut up and let everyone else make the movie without his input! I'm seriously flabbergasted at this POS waste of time. I'll be asking Comcast for my money back for this excuse for a movie. John and Bruce, wtf were you thinking? Did you agree to be in this POS as a favor to a friend?",negative
The Prince,"The Prince (2014)Ha! A joke. The main character is played by a Bruce Willis wannabe, Jason Patric, and he's decent, barely¬Öbut Willis isn't just decent, he's compelling. Still, this movie could have been decent. Barely. But the writing (and direction, overall) are horrid. I mean so unbelievable and amateurish you have to laugh.This is a tough guy movie‚ÄîPatric plays a guy who is just a nice (handsome) old car mechanic with a cute daughter away in the big city, but he has a past as a super fighter, great with guns and wits. But the writer has him enter a bar and say absurd tough guy things, and then the people around the bar say absurd things back, either tough stuff, too, or just whiny mean stuff. It makes no sense.Of course, you do wish he could save his daughter. And guess what, he does! And kills a lot of people along the way, generally bullet proof in the process. Oh, and his daughter's teenage girlfriend has the hots for him. Etc.Wait, I'm not done! The movie shows Bruce Willis himself as a character! Yup, and he's pretty good, working with a lousy script. John Cusak shows up, too, and is almost pretty good, also with a lousy script. Don't be fooled. This is Patric's movie, and he is at a loss in the mess.",positive
The Kindergarten Teacher,"An engaging portrayal of a person who has lived her life in a state of perpetual disappointment and sees in her young student a chance for escape. Her life has never risen above the mediocre and she sees her children as being destined for this same fate. Seeing in her student the greatness that has always eluded her, she attempts to nurture it and live vicariously through his talent. She views capitalism, manifested in the father of her student, as a system that can stifle intellectualism & creativity and it will be his inevitable integration into this system that kills off his innate talent.Maggie Gyllenhaal delivers a stellar performance and carries the film. Gael Garcia Bernal never manages to elevate his character above the thinly drawn clich√© of the sleazy, pretentious professor. The young actor playing Jimmy does an acceptable job, but he is presented as nothing more than a catalyst for the central character's motivations.However, the action which she takes in the 3rd act, seems, given her motivations, too reckless and stupid. It is never convincing that this character would behave in this manner, which unfortunately means the ending of the film falls flat",negative
The Kindergarten Teacher,This movie was pretty deep...at first watching it I thought it was pretty weird and def felt like the teacher went to far...but the last scene made it all make sense and solidified exactly why the teacher did what she did (although it still wasn't right) she seen something in the kid and was passionate about his talent.

The Cobbler,"after watching sandlers previous comedy ""blended"" i thought sandler has lost his touch forever.. i read the reviews n confirmed that i am sane . so yeah that was terrible. this time i thought sandler will again disappoint so i read the reviews (spoiler free of course) first and this movie had a lot of hate, loads of it and mostly by the critics. so i had my hopes at the minimum threshold. but after seeing this movie.. gotta say CRITICS Don't KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. this movie was funny, witty and acting was also great. i must say sandler has not lost his mojo . and hopefully never will. this movie is cool and thats the end of it. . a must watch if u ask me.",negative
The Cobbler,"I am glad I ignored the bad reviews from users and critics and watched this movie. I didn't have any expectations when I rented it, but was merely in the mood for a comedy that would take my mind off of a hectic day. Luckily, The Cobbler fit the bill. It was funny, charming, clever and overall very entertaining. The premise of the movie was unique and intriguing, and I enjoyed the plot twists and fantasy moments alike. Adam Sandler was in great form, and the entire supporting cast made the movie work like a well oiled machine (pun intended). I didn't find the characters played by Adam Sandler offensive or distasteful, and there were some real laugh out loud moments. Of course, there were plenty of moments full of genuine sentiment, with lots of lessons to be learned. This is the kind of movie I want in my permanent collection, and if there is going to be a sequel, I can't wait to see it.",positive
Friend Request,"I'm a huge fan of horror. Generally, I'll watch every horror film that released in theater, so last night I went to see Friend Request. I didn't know it was opening night either and there were about 6 other people there. I walked in a couple minutes late during the intro sequence and found myself confused as I watched about three to five minutes of Facebook snapshots set to weird pop music. The movie then started, I guess, and that feeling of confusion never subsided. It got right into the plot and completely skipped any character development. I didn't care at all whether the lead character, or any other character in the film for that matter, lived or died. I didn't understand the motivation of the antagonist and it wasn't ever really explained. Apparently she was a witch or something similar and had magical powers for some reason. She wanted to kill all of the main characters friends for no reason other than she felt lonely, I think. I don't even know. The ending was even more jumbled and nonsensical. By the time the credits rolled, nothing was explained whatsoever. This was by far the worst film I've seen in theaters in recent memory. In fact, I don't remember ever seeing anything worse. Spare yourself the pain and save yourself two hours. I'd rather mow the lawn or something than have to sit through Friend Request again.",negative
Friend Request,"Since Unfriended last year we have Friend Request. Now, having seen this on IMDb listed as a ""Thriller"" I wasn't bought. Considering the film looked & sounded like a horror film I wasn't as excited as I was for Unfriended. Though that didn't deter me entirely! I then began to see trailers of the film in cinema & was sure it was a horror considering how creepy it looked, even still it was listed as a Horror on the Odeon website & I made plans to see it! I would've seen it anyway it looked that good!So, the film is about a girl named Laura who befriends a eccentric dark girl named Marina, who has no friends & is very quiet. She has a weird Facebook profile & begins to get clingy with Laura who is her 1 & only friend. But after a conflict Laura unfriends Marina & things go from bad to worse a dark presence begins to stalk Laura & make her lonely after Marina kills herself!My thoughts are that this film was really twisted & f*#ked up! It really grabs you & locks you into this deep dark twisted underworld of the internet & how making one error can have devastating effects on you & your life! It was really dark & made Unfriended seem tame in comparison!The kills were pretty good & sinister! The possession-on-the- internet theme was really scary & close to home as I use Facebook & the internet myself! It really gives that what if feel! I also liked the grimness of the film as a whole! It felt dark & really dreary which added to the atmosphere! Creepy parts of the film like the footage of the kills of Laura's friends appearing on her account & her friends unfriending her thinking she's the one posting them, I liked how it was done when the spirit was trying to turn everyone against Laura! It was a pretty good flow to the story!I overall thought this was a really good film & really dark & sinister to the core! You'll not be disappointing! 10/10",positive
Shimmer Lake,"Plot holes are common in the movies that have come out of Hollywood in the past three decades. Flashbacks and telling a story backwards are also quite common, in movies with uninspired plots, that would be unbearably boring, if the story was told in a chronological order. Even so, some films stand out for their glaring plot holes, others for their forgettable stories. Shimmer Lake has the distinction of standing out for both. The shallow characters and mediocre acting are minor annoyances, compared to the questions you are left with at the end: Someone actually got paid to write this piece of garbage? Someone actually read the script and said, yes this will make a good movie? I'm struggling to find a single redeeming feature in this sorry excuse for a movie and the best I can think of is that the photography wasn't that bad, the camera was steady and the sound was as expected. So perhaps I should have given it a 3 instead of a 1, but it's IMDb rating was already above 6, which is incredible for such a low in modern film-making.",negative
Shimmer Lake,"Very clever use of flash back to fill in the plot. Excellent script with comic touches. The acting is convincing in all the characters--even the little girl is very believable. This is the kind of movie that you can watch more than once in order to catch all the details. The pacing of the script is fast--no slow moments or unnecessary scenes. The writer's ability to add touches of humor in this drama is especially effective. And the actors deliver the lines with perfect timing. It is no comedy, so pulling this off is a real feat. A film with great writing, acting, directing, and editing is hard to find: Enjoy.",positive
Unfinished Business,Honestly I don't know why this movie didn't get what it deserved. It's really hilarious and heartwarming.,negative
Unfinished Business,"I was drawn to Unfinished Business from the first trailer, and the negative reviews didn't do much for my confidence. However, I gave it a go and whilst its not great, its a lot better than the critics are making it out to be. I watched this on a plane, so it was heavily censored so I missed a lot of jokes. I think this cancels out the fact that I didn't have to see certain scenes that would probably have made me hate the film, so as far as I'm concerned its a tie.Vince Vaughn hasn't had a good 10 years, but he looks more alive here than he has in other rubbish. Dave Franco and Tom Wilkinson are quite funny as his dual sidekicks, even if they got a bit inconsistent sometimes or stale at others. Franco's bringing a box of personal belongings to a job interview ""to seem confident"" evoked genuine amusement in me. Sienna Miller plays a smug villain surprisingly well - the fact that I hated her is probably a good indicator that she's doing a good job. James Marsden also does a great job in key scenes. I imagine the largest complaint with this film is the lack of laughs, which is true and worth knocking off a few stars in and of itself. But I was pleasantly surprised with the family angle that Ken Scott took here, and whilst it was underdeveloped, it showed that there were some nice intentions here. The line that Vaughn's daughter writes at the end probably ended up being the nicest piece of writing in the entire film.So to conclude, Unfinished Business suffers on laughs and a conventional story, but there's enough good moments here to stop it being a total waste of time.",positive
Don't Knock Twice,"What a load of rubbish.The horror genre is riddled with bad movies, and is an arena most fresh film directors like to enter, as it is fairly straightforward and doesn't require the same skills a serious drama does. The problem is: to make a really good horror, you do need a lot of skills. Whoever made this had no idea what they were doing. The script is lazy and predictable, with one overused clich√© after another. It's so tedious and frustrating. And then there's this ridiculous premise with an interracial couple... Guess what race the girl is? No surprise there.This film is absolute bottom.",negative
Don't Knock Twice,"I had seen the cover of this movie as a related item on a few horror films and thought the plot was intriguing. Then I saw the Blu Ray was on sale at Walmart, which is actually interesting because it was accidentally stocked two months ahead of its release date. But I didn't complain as I took it home ready for what I was hoping would be a good spooky horror movie night. I wasn't disappointed. Despite the negative reviews, this ended up being one of the better horror treats from IFC Midnight and one of the best overall horror films in recent memory. -Plot- Chloe is somewhat estranged from her ex-addict mother Jess for the beginning of her life. But now a more stable and wealthy Jess wants to reconnect with her daughter. But before happily ever after could happen, Chloe and a friend had gone to a local neighborhood house where urban legend says a vengeful witch resides. The legend states that if you knock on her door twice, she will come and take you to her world. Well, they knocked twice. That is just the basic plot that sums up the first 5 minutes. Its a typical genre plot, but it is done surprisingly well. I am appalled by the negative scores. This is better than your average scary movie. The mythos is very creepy. The acting is above average for the genre and budget. The directing and cinematography contain some beautiful and terrifying imagery. The musical score is an instant horror classic. The sound design altogether is intense. The trailer for this surprisingly doesn't give away even half of the scares so even seeing it beforehand wont ruin any of it. But the trailer doesn't help its case either. There are plenty of jump scares that will truly get to you. Some might call them lazy, but their just nit picky. The entity of the witch is truly horrifying and will have you reaching for a blanket or light switch in all of its on screen moments. The actor playing the witch entity is the same that played the scary ""mama"" entity from Mama and the emaciated demon at the end of REC, so you know you're in for some scary imagery with this guy. The mythos of the movie does get a little over indulgent toward the end, but it still works well, despite a somewhat rushed ending and typical horror movie ""bad logic"" by some characters. Id compare some of the scary moments to ""Lights Out"" and even one early sighting of the witch to the Nun painting scene in ""The Conjuring 2"". I am surprised this didn't get a nationwide theatrical release as its production value is pretty nice looking compared to nationwide horror craps like Bye Bye Man. I attribute its absence from cinemas to its lack of a recognizable star. Which is unfortunate since I would have loved to experience this on the big screen. But that's what makes the horror genre so special. Even little gems like this that are ignored by mainstream media can end up being big cult classics and I believe this is a candidate. I am a horror junky and don't scare that easily anymore, but the entity of the witch really got to me. I really found myself inching toward the light switch and looking to see if something was behind me multiple times. One of the few films in a long time that I had trouble watching in the dark entirely during my first viewing. I would even go as far as to say this is a more accessible and fast paced take on A24s period horror ""The Witch"". I think the negative reviews will surely get lost in praise as this finds its audience. I gave it a 10/10 to do my small part in helping its score improve, but my real grade would be maybe a 8.5/10. Its truly much better than the trailer suggest and definitely better than the negative reviews say. If you want a good fright night with a lover or friends, or even alone, then this is a perfect choice. If you liked ""Lights Out"" or ""The Conjuring"" style horror then beware you're in for a scare. Just make sure its dark and the volume is high. I'm adding this to my go to Halloween season movie playlist.",positive
Bad Words,"With a premise and character right in his wheelhouse, first time director and star Jason Bateman takes a script that could've been undermined by its clich√©s in the hands of a lesser talent and delivers an almost-winner with 'Bad Words'.On paper, Guy Trilby is one of the most unlikeable protagonists in recent film history, but Bateman is so skillful at these kinds of characters that you find yourself liking him despite your self. Talented co-star Kathryn Hahn provides a nice foil, and newcomer Rohan Chand is a dazzling breath of unpretentious fresh air as Guy's rival and eventual prot√©g√©.Though it never quite gels into something special, 'Bad Words' is a solid directorial debut for Bateman, and I look forward to seeing what he does next.",negative
Bad Words,"I was blown away by the surprisingly low ""6.7"" current rating on IMDb. My theory: The easily offended were easily offended (perhaps the movie should have been called ""Bad Words"").(Some of my favorite comedies: Dumb & Dumber, Super Troopers, and Tommy Boy).Jason Bateman stared in, and directed, this ""tightly"" constructed DARK adult comedy. There was not a wasted second or single ""slow"" moment in the entire 89 minutes.Everything was dead-on: The originality of the storyline, the casting, the acting, the timing, the tone, and THE KID!... I've never been a big fan of the ""cute, heart-strings-pulling, kid"" clich√©, but you don't have to be to appreciate this kid - he takes NOTHING away from the dark humor, and only adds substantially to the film in every way. His authenticity and interaction with Bateman's character is as good as it gets (Roeper compared Bateman's spot-on apathy to Bill Murray's, and I couldn't agree more - you could just as easily picture Murray working his magic with the same degree of unflappability, esp. opposite such a contrastingly upbeat kid).Bateman is an unassuming Rock Star that let's his talents do the talking, and I'm looking forward to the next film he directs and leads.",positive
Gantz: O,"Gantz was a good read as a manga because you could skip trough the lamer parts and just view is as a pure action title - which was its strongest part. The fights were entertaining, the art was lovely dark, some of the ideas were actually decently original and the gory 'live or die' policy gave the series a nice feel. This 3DCGI movie on the other hand doesn't really deliver any of that. It does have very successful 3D design and for once the CGI doesn't look too awkward either. Definitely a better pic for that matter than Space Pirate Captain Harlock or Final Fantasy Kinsglaive. As an adaptation, for person like me who is familiar with all of these source materials, I have to say Gantz doesn't work as a stand alone title at all. So others shouldn't bother and Gantz fans will be pleased to some extend at least? I am not sure about that either. This movie is the least mature take on the Gantz franchise for sure. Much like with Berserk Golden Age Arc movies (yes, not the new hideous series, but the movies) - this series seems now like a shonen title aimed for teens while it is originally meant to be mature content for adults. Other than few blood spats and Berserk sex scenes, you will not find much mature and brutal content in them. Some would agree those won't work with CGI well, so it is better not to even try.That leaves me to the question, who is the target audience for this title? I guess the fact that Netflix got it soon after release widely, implies how niche audience we are talking about. On the other hand, I would have never watched this movie if it hadn't been on Netflix recommendations. In the end, I will recommend this piece to everyone who enjoys cyberpunk.",negative
Gantz: O,"Gantz is one of my favourites ( or probably my favourite) manga ever. I've following Hiroya Oku ( the guy who created Gantz) work for years. When i knew about a new Gantz Film coming this year I was very excited but, at the same time, I didn't think that we could watch this film on theatres in Argentina. Well I was wrong, we could due anifest Latin America. What can I say about Gantz O? The animation is AMAZING. The best that i've seen for a long time. The fights, superb . Oka , ""George"" and Nobuo , members of the sadistic and cool Osaka team, have the best fights of the movie. The music fits really well. The Osaka mission is know as one of the best of the manga and it was a really clever choice to pick it up and make a movie about it. About Kato, he is the hero in this movie and you'll end loving him. And the aliens... they're bizarre, scary and really violent. Just like in the manga. To sum up, if you have the opportunity, watch it. Yeah, there're some missing characters, but this movie was so good, so entertaining, that you will forget that in seconds.",positive
Zombeavers,"Zombeavers follows the story of five friends on a nice weekend out on the lake when suddenly malicious beavers come into the mix, that's where things start to turn horrific. I haven't enjoyed as much absurdity in film in such a long time. I mean by first glance of this poster, you're probably thinking ""This looks like such a dumb movie"" and my god, you don't even know how right you are. This was a pretty bizarre film but for some odd reason, I actually really enjoyed it. Don't worry this was a pretty stupid movie but I really came across to having a enjoyable time. For starters, the film did have a pretty commonplace plot that was pretty inevitable to see happen. The design for the Beavers were so laughable for the design in general and for the film that made them more appealing to see be played out but it was kinda silly to make them be puppets. One thing that I found absurd and uncanny was whenever someone got bit from one of the Beavers, they would start to turn into this human like beaver with a giant, claws and even the buck teeth, I was really a sight for sore eyes but it was pretty obscure and very bizarre. The acting was a minimal risk for this type of film but I guess you could say it was pretty fair with some of it was a bit exaggerated at some parts. My favorite portion out of the whole film would have to be the John Mayer and Bill Burr cameos, even though their characters were a bit foolish, they still managed to bring in some ample humor to their characters. I think the makers of this film really knew what they were getting their selves into and basically knew it was going to be a absurd film. Overall, this was mainly a stupid film with the stupidity being on point with this type of campy horror film but you can mainly get a kick out of it for the most part. Some of you may hate this film, some of you may appreciate and have fun with it like I did. Either way, give these Beavers a chance.",negative
Zombeavers,My friend and I were legit totes having a bad day until we found this movie... It looked pretty interesting so we thought we would give it a go. We have never seen something so well put together in our entire lives! This is officially the best movie I have ever seen. I laughed so hard and also cried. It was a mix of both scary and funny. It was so funny when the girl screamed on the hood of the car oh my gosh I cried. But it was a good cry. My friend screamed so loud. It was hysterical. I recommend this to the rest of my sorority sisters for when they are having a bad day and just need to laugh it out. Also this girl teaches you how to give 2 good slaps to a cheatin' ex-no-good-hot boyfriend.,positive
Toc Toc,"Whoever said this movie is horrible because it ""makes fun of people who suffer from OCD"" does not know the difference between comedy and insult. Of course , the pc police needs to learn outside tur US (it's a Spanish movie) people still enjoy a good laugh without being worried about which snowflake segment will be hurt.",negative
Toc Toc,As the majority of Spanish comedies it was a very light and life-like movie. You can sense the simplicity of the characters but that does not make the movie less valuable. It has a great message and I definetely saw myself in these characters.,positive
13 Sins,"13 SINS is the American remake of the Thai horror film 13: GAME OF DEATH, which is well worth watching for anyone interested in the subject matter. It goes without saying that this remake is by far the inferior movie, although those who haven't seen the original might enjoy it regardless. The story is about a down-on-his-luck guy, struggling financially, who finds himself tasked with performing a series of tasks in return for money.The stakes start off low but gradually build to more and more extreme situations. The budget for the film is low but the events staged are quite convincing, although it's unfortunate that some of the better tasks from the Thai original are skipped over. The main actor isn't particularly good but Ron Perlman is effective as the dogged cop investigating the case. The usual gamut of shocking scenes, bad taste moments, and gore are enough to keep this little story watchable.",negative
13 Sins,"This is a wonderful critique of raw capitalism and the unquestioned reign of the 1% for those willing to see it. I recommend viewing this movie to anyone who can relate to the inhuman transformation we are all forced to go through in order to survive in so-constructed and firmly held objectivist societies.This movie deserves a cult following.The story is slow to start, but picks up later on. There isn't much bling, but a lot of substance to the story. The acting is solid. The story is intriguing. There is a plot twist. Other characters could have been fleshed out more for greater immersion, but the protagonist himself is well portrayed.I enjoyed watching this movie, but you should know my score is not based on the quality of the movie itself. I gave it a 10/10 because the underlying system critique resonated with me.",positive
Strange Magic,"If you look at the statistics of IMDb votes, you will find that Strange Magic unfortunately falls into the category of ""either you love it or hate it"" - very few in-betweeners.From a graphical animation viewpoint it is superb, with well thought out details backed by a lot of hard work. For adult viewers who like animations (like me of course!) the plot, musicality and characters are significantly above the average animation, with a well-balanced socially and politically conscious theme.The immense flake it has got in the media and the ""hate it"" viewers are totally unwarranted. Its main problem is the strong disconnect between its actual adult theme and characterization, vs the way it is portrayed and marketed as a family animation - a sort of fairy tale mummy bring kiddies to - and you can see many of the complainers fall directly into this category.In other words, it 'looks like' animation for kids, but the plot and dialogue is totally way too adult.... which is exactly what keeps it interesting for me! Kudos to Mr Lucas for doing this - just too bad the real target market segment of ""adults who like fairy tale animation"" is just too small for it to make any commercial impact. But... thanks all the same!",negative
Strange Magic,"I absolutely love this film, but I'll admit it may not be everyone's cup of tea. Pretty much non-stop singing through the first half and some odd song placement can be a bit jarring to some people. Overall though, it's a very cute and BEAUTIFULLY animated film with some great humor, on point voice acting, and top notch singing. Off beat in the best of ways with very memorable characters that really make the movie. I LOOOOVE Bog King and Marianne and their interactions with each other. Just weird enough to be a cult classic, in my opinion. Definitely worth a shot, if you have an hour and a half to spare some day. You may just love it!",positive
The Canyons,"I think that a lot of the criticism of ""The Canyons"" is missing the point. All of Ellis' stories have a detached quality in them which makes them hard for audiences to relate to, especially on screen. They seem ""unreal"".A constant theme in Ellis' work is the existential ""ennui"", the boredom and emptiness of life, the absence of deeper meaning. His main characters feel that something is missing, but they can't pinpoint what it is. As an audience, we know what they are missing - connection with themselves and others, and genuine emotion. This is why there is so much disconnect between the protagonists and the viewers.It may be that the choice of Hollywood as a backdrop for this display of existential emptiness is an unlucky one because few people can relate to wealthy Hollywood life on a personal level.However, I applaud the filmmakers for at least having the guts to try. The people in this movie are all choosing materialism over personal connection, and mechanical sex instead of intimacy, an orgasm is for them a reflex just like sneezing. Neither money, sex, nor social status provide happiness for those who get it in abundance; only those who don't have it in abundance think they will bring happiness. The values that popular culture upholds are devoid of value.In addition, I think James Deen does a perfect job playing a narcissistic, controlling, emotionally empty vessel on the verge of snapping, and Lindsay Lohan (this is her first movie I've seen, and given the bad press, I'm positively surprised) does a great job playing a woman despairing from choosing hell in physical luxury, while starving emotionally.",negative
The Canyons,"This film suffers heavily from a distinct lack of sexiness and way too much boring dialogue. And that is just the beginning of the problems. You really know a film is bad when Lindsay Lohan is the only bright light in it! The Acting: Lindsay Lohan does quite a good job in a couple of scenes involving emotion, though she is much less effective in the (too abundant) dialogue heavy scenes. James Deen shows a few flashes of talent but mainly seems as if he is trying to emulate a method actor with no real understanding of how to actually pull it off. The other ""performances"" are uniformly bad to less-bad.The Writing: One word... Awful. Boring dialogue and unbelievable story. Poor ending. I think Bret Easton Ellis is a one-trick pony. He has never managed to equal what he achieved with American Psycho.The Directing: Same word as above... Awful. Paul Schraeder really should sink back into obscurity. This project is definitely not going to help his career. Poor choice of camera angles and poor framing abounds. He shows no sign of his earlier talents. I think he is lost in his own imagined ""genius"" as he tries for a gritty realism and gets ugly pretentiousness.Camera, Lighting, etc.: Poor lighting in almost every indoor scene. It looks like it was shot on a smart phone. The music is irritating. Wardrobe... What wardrobe? It looks like the actors supplied the clothes they wanted to wear. There is no costume design or set design in evidence here.Sexiness: Basically there is none. Lindsay Lohan looks pretty sad with her prominent beer belly, sagging breasts and 1960s style lingerie. Control-top granny panties are not lust-inducing! The sex scenes are boring and much less spicy than the hype suggested. The ""orgy"" was so badly filmed it and lit that it was impossible to find it sexy or even interesting. Women or those with a gay interest may find it more sexually appealing but I don't find dangling limp penises to be anything but silly looking. The entertainment media painted this as shockingly graphic but it is pretty tame compared to cable shows like True Blood if you discount the number of penises on view.In Conclusion: Not really worth a look even if you just want to see Lindsay Lohan in the buff. There was more of her on view in Playboy and her body looked at least a bit better in the magazine. If you are looking for titillating sex scenes you would be better off with Skinemax. If you want to see a dramatic expose of Hollywood's dark underbelly look elsewhere. In fact just look elsewhere. Period.",positive
Flight 7500,"I usually like movies in plane but with a good story. This movie has only a plane and no story at all. Even plane is cheap CGI. All what had to be scary stuff is stupid screams, blue pale hands. Maybe this was scary 15 years ago but now is almost 2015. We saw crap like this many times before. There are some known actors (not mega actors but still known) in this movie where I think why the hell they went for this movie. Acting also is unbelievable. There is no explanation to this movie. It ends just as stupid as it started. Scream and credits here we come. Some reviewers here say it is entertaining. If this is entertaining than what is boring for those people? Really! Once again - Do not waste your time and money. Save yourself from this cheap film.",negative
Flight 7500,If you are one of those people who think the horror movie is supposed to be a long screaming run in the woods with a knife equipped maniac on your back then let it pass. This is no cheap thrill jump fest and you might be bored.If you think the true horror builds on suspense and should bring you an unexpected twist at the end you will love this. This is really deep Japanese style horror movie that will left you stunned in the end. The movie systematically builds the suspension using a lot of different false twists.Really recommended!,positive
Clown,"Even if you aren't bothered by clowns, you have to admit that a killer clown is a pretty creepy idea. I mean clowns are always around children, they have a pale face, goofy hair and bright welcoming colors, masking the homicidal tendencies underneath. I always thought it would make a good movie idea, and Clown is about the closest we get to that. It's less of a killer clown story as much as it is a possession movie. This particular clown suit does not come off. If someone puts it on, it fuses with their skin while the demon slowly possesses them. The demon is a cannibal and only eats children. 5 children to be exact: one for every month of winter, or so the lore goes. It's an interesting take on the killer clown notion and I usually like Eli Roth so I was excited to see this movie. Unfortunately, Clown misses the mark in almost every way.It's an Eli Roth movie so of course there's lots of blood and gore, which is fine. Eating kids is also inherently disturbing, even though the killing is not shown on screen you do see a lot of children's guts, blood and body parts. The thing is, it doesn't really add anything to the movie. That's mainly because the movie doesn't build up much tension in the first place. It's slow to start - the dad is the one who puts on the costume to surprise his kid at his birthday party, but he falls asleep in it and when he wakes up, he finds that the wig infused with his hair and the costume is indestructible. The psychological aspect of this is interesting for a while, but it never goes the extra mile. Everything we see here has been done to death already. Just because the premise is cool doesn't mean cheesy dialogue and inappropriate jump scares get a free pass. They're still annoying as hell, and sadly they are littered throughout the entire movie.This movie has every horror clich√© in the book. The jump scares in particular really detract from the movie's atmosphere. It sets a dark tone at the beginning, and even more so when the psychological elements start dripping in and the dad questions his sanity as he discovers more about the suit, but every once in a while someone will pop up behind someone else and the music will be LOUD for a second as if it's supposed to scare us. No, it doesn't work like that. All the good build up in the first two acts are dampened by these cheap scares - they give no time for tension to build before throwing another one at you, and it's just annoying after the first couple of times. The dialogue doesn't help either. Neither does the acting. Peter Stormare is great as usual but he doesn't get that much screen time. It's mainly the female lead and her reactions to her husband turning into this monster, and let me tell you, she is a terrible actress. There are also a lot of kids in this movie and kid actors are almost always terrible. You just don't care about any people on screen, except for the guy being possessed but even he is only in the first half of the movie. We're just stuck following a bland wife and her bland kid trying to stop the evil clown from killing other bland kids.The clown itself does not disappoint. It does look genuinely creepy, and the costume and make-up are very well done, but sadly that doesn't make up for a bad script and poor direction. It just has no style. It's really by-the-numbers horror with an Eli Roth tinge. The worst part is, it isn't even scary. If you're a fan of Eli Roth then you might get some enjoyment from this, but if you aren't a horror fanatic then don't bother.",negative
Clown,"No Spoiler alerts here! This movie was a good horror movie and playing on a character that a lot of people have phobias about makes it that much better. At the start, I was honestly feeling a cheesy, B movie type with a possible special appearance by the Dwight Johnson or Dolph Lundren :) The gore in the movie was top shelf and watching it with my wife and daughter (who are both scared of clowns) made it that much better and they absolutely loved it! And my daughter still slept in her own bed. I honestly don't know if there has been a horror movie with the main character of a clown that has been this good in the last 5-10 years, if I'm wrong please let me know of such movie. It was awesome how the story jumped feet first into the plot. Would love to see a prequel if it's done right .....Loved the gore!",positive
Unicorn Store,"Watching this film was a waste of time. Having to endure it's desperate attempts to poke into junior was torture and anticipating a plot was frustrating. The ending, was the rotten cherry on top to this garbage.It was like watching a children's fairy tale story desperately trying to tap into millenials.",negative
Unicorn Store,"I started watching this thinking it was more of a funny, bull crap fantasy concept, but found myself moved to tears by the end of it. Maybe it's just because I'm different, just like Kit, and I don't wanna grow up. Society feels like the depressing, gray and beige setting of her office - rigid and colourless. Individuals that stand out are pushed away instead of embraced. This movie might not be for everyone, and not everyone might get it, but for those of us feeling like we can't fit into the norm it really hits home.Brie Larson does an amazing job at both acting and directing, and Jackson is simply outstanding as the colourful salesman.",positive
Once Upon a Time in Venice,"The other reviewer gave a horrible score calling it ""average,"" but compared to all the other garbage coming out lately it is a gem. I can't remember the last movie that kept me wondering what's going to happen next. Also, being a surfer bum from S. Cali, the scenery and personas of the ""locals"" was nostalgic and spot on. If I wasn't laughing, I was at least grinning throughout the movie. Great casting with a surprising number of (old) A-listers throughout. A breath of fresh air from the &^$@ coming out of Hollywood these days.",negative
Once Upon a Time in Venice,I eventually turned this off. (hence the 1 out of 10) I gave it over an hour to actually captivate me but it failed so dramatically that I turned off in anger.This movie tries so hard and fails so hard. It tries hard to be funny and you end up feeling like you're watching a 5 year old making jokes. It tries too hard to be smart but it takes a smart person to make a smart script and not look like they're a Mr smartypants wannabee. This person is a Mr smartypants wannabee. It tries too hard to be sexy and just looks Chauvinistic.There was some potential here but completely lost.,positive
Survivor,"I couldn't even finish the movie. She is supposed to be a security expert and doesn't know anything about keeping herself safe. I'm certainly not a security expert by any means but I do have some common sense. She doesn't put the scarf around her head to mask her face, she knows cameras are there but looks straight into them. She goes to predictable places, finds her friends to help her making them targets. She doesn't get rid of the tracking chip that's in her ID. She doesn't show an ounce of actual emotion throughout any of the movie. After running from the Ambassador, almost getting shot and then almost getting killed by the Pierce's character, she runs home and then cuddles with Sam. She seeks him get killed and barely reacts other than running away. Sure she can make the phone jiggle when she's ""scared"" but that's as believable as it gets. Yikes.",negative
Survivor,I am shocked at some of the reviews. The movie grabs you from the start and keeps you involved and waiting for the next action packed scene. Brosnan is truly believable in his role and so are all of the other cast members. Yes it does have some..well in real life it might not happen this way..but overall a cliff hanger..Demonstrates the corruption that can lead to terrorist attacks in our system. And how easily the person who is the most patriotic can be turns on and condemned and sees as a problem instead. I was on the edge of my seat..great acting and a great script. Okay I'm a Brosnan fan and loved the fact that he could play this role with such conviction and good acting..Obviously he should still be James Bond instead of you know who.,positive
Parkland,"I watched Parkland on the 50th anniversary of JFK's Assassination which definitely added to the experience knowing that I was watching a dramatisation of this historic event 50 years to the day later.Using the Vincent Bugliosi book Reclaiming History as its source material Parkland is a realistic, almost documentary style, recounting of that historic day and subsequent weekend when nothing would ever be the same again.It should be noted that Conspiracy Theorists will be disappointed because of this as both the book and Parkland are squarely in the 'Oswald did it alone camp'. Which of course is the case! The scenes in the hospital trauma room are realistic and relentless and although everyone knows the outcome of both these scenes you find yourself willing for a different outcome on both occasions but for different reasons.The ensemble cast were fantastic, particularly Billy Bob Thornton (Agent Sorrell), Tom Welling (Agent Kellerman), Paul Giamatti (Abraham Zapruder) and I'm surprised to report that I thought Zac Efron did an excellent and gut wrenching job as the young doctor who did not want to give in to the inevitable. Some memorable performances from some lessor known actors, particularly Rory Cochrane as Earl Rose who attempts to keep the Presidents body in Dallas for the autopsy and Robert Catrini as the undertaker to Lee Harvey Oswald. The film perfectly shows the chaos of that weekend and the unbelievable events as they unfolded.As the final credits rolled the cinema audience quietly filed out having been transported back in time for 90 gut wrenching minutes. Fantastic and memorable.",negative
Parkland,"If you think you have seen enough on screen about the assassination, this movie doesn't go into territory covered by previous movies like ""JFK"". No conspiracy theories or reconstruction of the shooting. Instead its provides you with a detailed fascinating view of the events and people that you don't figure centrally on screen before. What happened at the hospital from the point of view of doctors and nurses - harrowing. Removing the body after death to Air Force One by the secret service. Lee Harvey Oswald's brother and mother and their reaction. Zapruder's filming of the event and the way the film was developed and first viewed. The FBI's first reaction to the shootings and Oswald.The movie is very well directed. It gives a feel of being in the thick of things. Authentic. The acting is good with a mostly well chosen cast. Zac Efron as the doctor who first attended to JFK. Paul Giamatti as Zapruder. Tom Welling and Billy Bon Thornton as a Secret Service agents. The actor playing Oswald looks like him. A couple of not so good choices. The actress playing Jackie didn't look too much like her. Colin Hanks didn't look like a chief resident doctor.Overall very interesting. Worth a watch.",positive
The Overnight,"What might be an average French film, makes a spectacular American tale about love and friendship, and the lines that blur them -- that abstract thing we all seek, which is human connection and understanding, in a place free from judgment. Any open-minded and free- thinking person, who has experienced a lot, or maybe not lived quite enough but yearns for something more, should enjoy the emotional awakening experienced among these four thinking and deeply feeling humans. This is at the same time a story about the comforts of stability and the drawl of temptation; it is a seduction more of the mind, than the body, that drives these characters. Don't be fooled, sex has very little to do with what any of these people really are after deep down inside. They are not so different from the rest of us.",negative
The Overnight,"Being a big fan of Tailor Schilling I really wanted to watch The Overnight, but four years after the movie's release I found it really hard to find a viewing platform. Unlike other Schilling appearances this was not on Netflix or Amazon. So in the end a friend gave me her copy to watch.
I thought this was a brilliant film, because it was so different from the mainstream blockbuster. With no big budget, ($200,000) and no famous actors it still gripped me from start to finish. I only recognised Schilling on the cast list but the other three actors were really good too.
I loved the intimacy of the location and short twelve hour timeline of the script which I felt made empathy with the characters more intense; the way the night gradually became stranger and darker really held me in an emotional spin to the end. Personally I made sure the first time I viewed The Overnight I had no previous siting of the trailer or reviews, and I would highly recommend this approach.
I didn't find the film offensive in any way. The pool scenes a bit daft maybe and the scenes at the end of the film although erotic due to great acting were not in the slightest pornographic and may have ended too soon.
Isn't it strange how in the Western world making films depicting graphic violence, huge body counts and attacks on women are taken as being quite normal and hardly worth a comment but introduce a little bit of sex and nudity causes many people (including reviewers of this film) to reach for the smelling salts. That is perverse.
Great film, highly recommended for the open minded amongst us.Graham UK.",positive
