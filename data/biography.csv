Nothing to Lose,"This is a movie trying to pass itself as a biopic, but is just a fairy tale. It's trying to rewrite history to try pass an image of Edir Macedo, the guy who financed the movie, as a humble honest man of god.Besides all of this... the movie is placated with problem such as pacing, acting, directing, cinematography. In of itself it would be a bad movie... but since it's obviously just a propagandas piece just makes it worse.And lastly... If you pay attention. The movie was brigaded by bots, (or just lots of people with spare time) to give it 10 starts. The same has happened with every user review site... including specially Brazilians ones, where professional reviewed average score is 1 point.something... while user review is always 4 point something... almost 5 (out of 5).",negative
Nothing to Lose,"It was a speechless movie to watch. It's starts out with the main character being a different kid. Have you been that different kid that stood out in your childhood?
Than it goes on for him finding his real purpose in life. He becomes a recognizable leader that even made the catholic leader of Brazil a little shakey.",positive
Manjhi: The Mountain Man,"With due respect to Nawaz's acting and the man 'Dashrath Manjhi' who did such an insurmountable task, I would like to say that this shouldn't be classified as a movie, neither should it be classified as a documentary. It is not even a one-time watch.In the worst case scenario, it is a one-time watch, but only till intermission. People making such movies should consider on tweaking the storyline so that the movie emerges out as a good experience for viewer. I don't know what people found interesting in this movie but I will try to summarize my experience in following points :1. Entertainment - 4/10 This is only because of the first half of the movie, which is decent in terms of providing entertainment value to the viewers. The second half will almost literally compel you to sleep in theatre. 2. Determination - 5/10 People are confusing psychotic fad shown in the movie with words like 'determination' and 'willpower'. 3. Romance - 7/10This is not even a complete story. It is just a 2 hour long fact that a man carved out a path out of mountain in memory (psychotic fad) of his wife who passed away in an accident on mountain.4. Action - 2/10 Almost nil. There is a lot of time devoted in the movie to show misdeeds by highbrow goons. Even till the end, the dots for their punishment doesn't get connected despite of the fact that they are involved till end in the plot with Nawaz's character. All we get is just an 'out of nowhere' loose scene.5. Adventure - 2/10 Except for the maniac mountain crushing there is nothing at all. 15 minutes of futile scenes showcase Nawaz's travel from Bihar to Delhi by foot just to make the premise of a useless 2 minute scene in Delhi. It may have happened in real as it is based on a real story but from a movie perspective it was absolute rubbish in order to portray determination of the character.",negative
Manjhi: The Mountain Man,"Expect no grandeur and very un-Bollywood-like. The plot of the movie unfolds quite slowly like a classic movie should be, building up gradually in the first half and then you are so engrossed into the movie, that you hardly realize how quickly the second half passed by. Nawazuddin Siddiqui could have been the only actor at of today who could do justice to this role. Ketan Mehta has made sure that the real touch in this movie sticks as close to the actual incidences and he has succeeded thoroughly. Many filmmakers attempt to use or portray the themes from this part of India (like Amir Khan's PK or Salman Khan's Dabang). One can easily find that genuineness of Bihari culture is so hollow that it brings down the impact of the movie, rather than uplift it. The way all the actors have delivered their dialogues or put on their costumes is phenomenal. Siddiqui's performance is a stand-out and without doubt, it'll a benchmark in Bollywood, IMHO. Craziness of Manjhi is a legacy for Indians and Siddiquit has succeeded in bringing that out on the silver screen.",positive
Reis,"Usually a biography is written after death or resignation. This may be the first political biography written while the subject's still alive and governing the country. As expected; the movie never mentions how Erdogan empoweres the Gulen movement against innocent soldiers and how he defended the Gulen movement when they were capturing all the critical positions within the army, police, intelleigence and justice deparments. The movie doesn't mention how he empowered the terrorist PKK against his own army. Doesn't mention how he failed to overthrone Esad which led to millions of Syrians leaving their countries. The movie underlines one simple idea. How magnificent he is. The most manipulated story telling I've ever seen. Even Goebbels would find it a bit ""extreme"". You expect a very high production quality when you think of how easy to fund this movie with government sources but the director fails again. Obviously he has problems with modern art and contemporary story telling. Acting was also not satisfactory but it was the least disastrous part of the movie. Everyone should watch it to witness the shameful history.",negative

Rosewater,"This film is a disaster. The narrative is scrambled....sometimes schmaltzy, sometimes lost, sometimes both. Note to writers and director: humans don't talk like this. Characters are all either one- dimensional or no-dimensional. Camera-work...seriously? Every 5 minutes there's a shot out of focus, and another that focuses on something completely irrelevant. It's a real shame, because there's a wonderful story to be told here, but not by this cartoonish treatment. In the real world, people don't walk around with either a halo or a black cloud over them---in this 'video' they do. May as well have them actually wear black and white hats, does the filmmaker really think his audience is this stupid? (hey, maybe he's right). If submitted by a high school film student, this is a solid B-. Don't waste your money, wait for NetFlix then avoid it.",negative
Rosewater,"John Stewart does an outstanding job skillfully portraying an incredible journey by a western journalist caught in the Iranian post-election revolt. a must-see thriller. The acting is captivating, and the sets are truly realistic as they filmed in the middle east. Definitely a work that will not be forgotten. This movie is particularly relevant with the current prosecution of journalists in Ukraine and the middle east. The audience is thrown into the riot environment with the amazing work of the directors. Jon Stewart does a great job. The actor playing Maziar is truly captivating. It is great to see an original film that captures some of the problems of our generation. Will look forward to Stewart's future works.",positive
Yip Man: Jung gik yat zin,"We get it, yip man, ip man, what ever the dude name is.He's a great grandmaster, a teacher of Bruce Lee (well, Bruce found another branch of martial arts long after anyway, but that's not the point), probably fought with the Japanese and stuff With all due respect to Master Ip (the real master Ip)enough with this crap please, Anthony Wong is not a martial artist, and as much as the fight look OK-ish, Eric Tsang? Come on HK Film makers, you can do better than this, give me overrated gangster love drama of the 90 or even a one man gun frenzy heroes like Chow Yun Fat Enough of this overblown Ip Man shits, you've got 4000 years of Chinese History, pick one and make a fresh story out of it.What's next? Ip man love life?Can't believe Anthony Wong would wanna do this kind of cheap movies, it's not that bad in itself, but the fact that they cheaply trying to milk every penny from the grandmaster ip itself is disgusting",negative
Yip Man: Jung gik yat zin,"The most interesting aspect between Herman Yau-Anthony Wong collaborations is that their partnership had its roots in Hong Kong Category III horror. Ebola Syndrome is still one of the most disgusting movies I have ever seen and been guiltily entertained by. Forget Outbreak or Contagion, Ebola Syndrome was a far more disturbing movie about a viral outbreak. Forget Hannibal Lecter, Anthony Wong truly played a disturbing sociopath in that movie. The point is: they're not afraid to delve into the gritty, the ugly and the disgusting.Set against the big commercial movie cog machine and the Ip Man franchise, the majority of Yau-Wong penchant for grittiness is diluted and only some of it remains in Ip Man: The Final Fight. It is that essence of the grittier and the uglier sides of Ip Man that makes out for the more interesting parts in Ip Man: The Final Fight, but it's also the film's major weakness because it never treads far enough from familiar territory.What the film ends up being more like tonally is a combination of the Wilson Yip- Donnie Yen Ip Man films and Bruce Lee My Brother, where it is loosely glossing over the details of the grandmaster's life and dramatically punching up the action so it can allow for fight scenes, but also providing a retro-gaze of Hong Kong accompanied with a celebrity guest-list cameos.For example, it's been said that Ip Man sported an opium habit. The concept is telegraphed but never truly explored. Another example is Hong Kong actor Liu Kai Chi gives a cameo as Ip Man's friend who is suffering from poverty. They start what might be a potentially interesting storyline but it never finishes itself. Much of the film is like that.There are about several subplots running through the story and they all end up as separate vignettes that do not rise above the sum of it's parts. For a biopic drama, that's a problem because it does not provide an unified narrative goal. This is not an editing issue. The story was based on Ip Chun's stories of his father and it is as if seemed like the screenwriter noted them down as told and the director literally shot them that way. So I attribute this issue to lazy writing. The retroactive voice-over device ends up killing a lot of the drama. The scene will be happening and the voice-over will cut in summing up the rest of the scene in past tense. It keeps glossing over by stating what happened instead of letting the audience experience what's happening in the now.Anthony Wong is very natural as Ip Man. He looks most like the real-life version of Ip Man and actually adopts a Foshan accent. He breathes many colors into the role and the scenes with Ip Man and his students is the heart of the film. Anthony Wong is pretty much the best thing about this movie and his performance alone is the price of admission.Eric Tsang has a great supporting role as a Crane style master who befriends Ip Man. There is a self-referential joke where Tsang says being a 'clan master' (獎門人) is difficult, a reference to his famous television game show, that was self-serving and unnecessary. Tsang and Wong share an awesome fight together. Not a lot of people remember that Eric Tsang started out as a stuntman; the fight looks very authentic. They were really smashing their forearms together. Eric Tsang is a badass.Something I noticed about the cinematography was there were way too many crane shots in this film. There's a scene that ends on a connective moment between two characters and then it cuts to a crane shot backing away presenting a view of the entire rooftop set. I have a theory about this. In Hong Kong, booking a crane from a production house is a planned expense and usually you would require more crew members or more time to set up a crane shot. Production houses in the Mainland will give crews an entire film equipment package in their deals, which includes cranes and jibs. With the cheap labor and higher amount of crew members, a crane shot can be set up much faster in the Mainland. As a recent occurrence, a lot of Chinese productions lead by Hong Kong directors have recently been very crane shot-heavy. Hong Kong directors, this needs to stop. You have to remember to pull back every once and a while.Just as a small footnote, I really hated the Bruce Lee cameo. Playing Bruce Lee in a film is by no means an easy feat but the actor they chose was abysmally awful. He made Bruce Lee look like a rich asshole sellout. It was not fun, nor did it work as a pop culture reference.Overall, I enjoyed this film, but I do not think it works completely as a standalone piece. It seems to fit as the final piece to this whole line of Ip Man films. In a way, I can't help it because they've made so many movies about Ip Man in such a short time.With every film, I see a little more of who this man was, what his legacy was and it had me thinking about even what being a good teacher means. I still think The Grandmaster is the best Ip Man film. They really don't need to make any more Ip Man movies. And if they do (and I think they are because I saw a poster for an Ip Man 3 with Donnie Yen), please do the story with Bruce Lee and get him right.For more reviews, please visit my blog at http://hkauteur.wordpress.com/",positive
The Clan,"I think Argentinians may enjoy this movie better than foreign audiences, judging from it's current score (7.0). Maybe it's because they're already familiar with the historical setting, story and characters. My guess is foreign audiences won't appreciate this movie so well -- I know I didn't. The plot is told in a very tedious way. We get to see kidnapping after kidnapping, with little to no emotion or conflict. Maybe it was the dull script, but no actor delivered good performances. Sure, some psychological conflict is hinted, but it never reaches the viewer in an honest or meaningful way. I also found it poorly directed, with a notable cringe-inducing and awkward scene paralleling one of the kidnappers having sex with his girlfriend and one of the victims being questioned. Skip this one and watch Nueve Reinas or El Secreto de sus Ojos instead.",negative
The Clan,"Few years after the dictatorship in Argentina by Rafael Videla is overthrown, the remaining members of that military order begin a life of crime, using as an excuse that the Argentinians sold the country and pushed the patriots into catastrophe. At this time in history, is where the story of Arquímides Puccio (Guillermo Franchella) and his family take place. Puccio is an old retired military who starts kidnapping rich youngsters not just for the money, but to satisfy an evil mind that wants suffering. However, his five children, Alejandro (Peter Lanzani), Maguila (Gastón Cocchiarale), Silvia (Giselle Motta), Adriana (Antonia Bengoechea) and Guillermo (Franco Masini), are the ones who end up with the biggest sorrow. This brilliant movie is not a conventional crime thriller, it also explores the psychological illness of all the members in this family caused by the oppressing voice of Puccio's patriarchy. Alejandro, the brilliant and successful eldest child, is the connection between us and the pain inside the characters. The narrative of the story begins by the end, and so it goes interchanging present and future, until they collide in a sublime climax when all the feelings and thoughts of the children explode. Each one of the characters, even though they were real, are so astoundingly designed that you can feel the hate of the father; the indifference of the mother; the rage, the fear and even the love of the children. Another remarkable aspect of this movie is the BSO, featuring an accurate selection between The Kinks, Credence Clearwater Revival, and Argentinian rock of the 80's like Seru Giran and Virus. This is also a portrait of the post-dictatorship era as a fictional interpretation of the feelings of an old retired military, his new war, and his new army: his family.",positive

Visually it did remind me of Gladiator due to amazing scenery and La vita e Bella due to colors and era. But as a whole it was something else, something touching, heart breaking and still full of humor. If I need to explain it with one word, it was poetic in each and every moment. Life of 3 poets. One very well known and experienced and two young and talented. A friendship that is bond with life and death. It should be really hard to capture it all but Yilmaz Erdogan did a great job as a director and actor. Two young poets, Kivanc Tatlitug and Mert Firat just makes you feel each and every moment of their life, their pain and their happiness so perfectly.I plan to see it again at the theater and keep telling the people that it deserves a chance at the film festivals around the world.",positive
Müslüm,"Müslüm Gürses and his tragic life story are seen as the success of this movie. Because of the problems with directing are so much that it looks like an amateur TV documentary. For example, in such a ""serious"" movie, it is not possible to understand why Müslüm Gürses hologram appears in the car store. In addition, none of the classic Müslüm Gürses songs are included in this film. All acting in the first part of his childhood and Zerrin Tekindor can be viewed for.",negative

Yves Saint Laurent,"Interesting insight into the life and less-known sides of the legendary Yves Saint Laurent. This was more than a mere tribute to the fashion icon by shots of most (if not all) of his successful collections, it was an in-depth description of what it meant to live with and love a sensitive genius who always carried his own crucifix. The dedication of the faithful Pierre was moving as he guarded over his frail partner who might go off anytime like fireworks. Consider me priggish if you will; I felt the film focused slightly too much on the decadence (alcohol, drugs, sex - you name it) of the chief protagonist. Though perhaps for some talented souls, these indulgences served as their Muse. The fashion shows were intoxicating, and the wedding gowns (especially the Madonna) were awe-inspiring and overwhelming. Overall, I'd say a 6.8 out of 10.",negative
Yves Saint Laurent,"In many respects, this biopic of the titular fashion designer is everything you might expect. It is full of beautiful people wearing beautiful clothes in beautiful surrounds. Fortunately though, Yves Saint Laurent is much more than that and we do get some insight into a man whose demons very nearly threatened to derail his reputation and career on more than one occasion. Too often, biographical films try to cram too much into the limited running time that a motion picture necessarily demands, so it is very pleasing that director Jalil Lespert has avoided the temptation to cover every stage of Saint Laurent's life and career, opting instead to focus, for the most part, on his emergence as a pre-eminent figure in French fashion circles and the ensuing bouts of self-destructive behaviour that threatened to overshadow his creative genius. The film does touch on the later stages of Saint Laurent's life, but primarily to contextualise the relationship with lifelong partner Pierre Berge, who we first meet in a pre-credit sequence set after Saint Laurent's death. The story is then told as a recollection of events from Berge, who provides a second-person narration as though it is being delivered to Saint Laurent himself.Pierre Niney takes on the role of the Algerian-born Saint Laurent, who we first meet at home in Oran on the Mediterranean coast. Whilst still in his teens, Saint Laurent finds himself working for Christian Dior, whose death in 1957 propelled Saint Laurent into the role of head designer at Dior's fashion house at just 21 years of age. Already encumbered by a social anxiety that he attributes to childhood bullying, Saint Laurent finds it difficult to cope with the aura of expectation that surrounds him. When he is drafted into the French military, Saint Laurent finds himself unable to cope, is confined to a psychiatric hospital and subjected to electroshock treatment. Sacked by Dior as a result, Saint Laurent establishes his own brand with the help of Berge (Guillaume Gallienne), a cash settlement secured from his former employer and the support of an American investor. From this point, Saint Laurent emerges as a superstar of the fashion world; each new collection met with adoring enthusiasm. However, whilst his professional profile explodes and he cements his reputation as one of the truly great designers, he sets out on a path of self-destruction; partaking in drugs, excessive alcohol consumption and infidelity in an effort to combat the depression, anxiety and insecurity that plague him.This is very much a film that examines the relationship between Saint Laurent and Berge, with the latter emerging as a stoic hero figure who stands by Saint Laurent throughout the tumult that was their personal and business relationship. If what we see is to be believed (and I have no reason to suggest we shouldn't), then Berge was a guardian angel for the troubled designer, serving as manager, constant companion, lover and lifesaver. It is hardly surprising therefore that the real life Berge has endorsed the film, which is based, in part, on his book Letters to Yves. Furthermore, Berge has praised the performances of both actors, telling Vogue magazine that he was ""blown away by Pierre Niney's performance. It really disconcerted me. It even upset me, because it's very difficult. At times, I thought it was Yves Saint Laurent himself. That's huge."" On Gallienne, Berge declared ""I think he's an extraordinary actor."" Of course, as a result of Berge's ties to the project, the filmmakers were granted access to Saint Laurent's original design studio and more than 70 of his vintage outfits and, it must be said, the clothes are stunning. Another key figure in Saint Laurent's life during his rise to fame was model Victoire Doutreleau (played by the stunning Charlotte Le Bon), who was one of Saint Laurent's few close friends until forced out of his life by Berge, who considered her a bad influence.Yes, the film is a celebration of Saint Laurent's creative genius, but it certainly doesn't shy away from the darker side of his personality. It is a reminder of the destructive nature of disorders such as depression and anxiety, even amongst those who seemingly have it all. The film looks elegant – sumptuous even – and the musical score draws upon classical, jazz, rock and opera at different times, to mostly good effect. Ultimately, Yves Saint Laurent is an engaging, if somewhat genteel, examination of the life (or part thereof at least) of a talented yet troubled individual. Lespert has crafted a film that explores the darker side of Saint Laurent's personality without diminishing his legacy as a fashion icon.",positive
Son of God,"Wowsers! If you're interested in a TV movie on the big screen than this is the movie for you. Featuring a Portuguese actor playing Jesus (because Son of God forbid that an actual Middle Easterner played Jesus in a Jesus movie, lest the Faithful go wild) it is literally the Jesus part of The Bible miniseries that played on cable last year with some extra scenes. The production values are exactly what you'd expect for a TV movie - horrible. They were hoping for a Passion of the Christ like hit, but the movie is almost gone from theaters and it's not even Easter.

Son of God,"For those who are expecting a repeat of the Mel Gibson movie, then prepare to be disappointed ... or pleasantly surprised. This movie is the sanitized version of the Gibson extravaganza. It is the movie that Gibson would have made if he had decided to ease off on the gratuitous depictions of violence. Depicting violence in a movie about Christ is unavoidable; it is part of the story. The violence has to be shown. The question is: how, without the violence itself becoming the main theme? This movie sticks to the story about Jesus; the violence is a part of the story. He is beaten, mocked, scorned, discredited, tortured, crucified and murdered. The story is told in its entirety. Yet, the director succeeds in telling the story in a straightforward non-sensationalist manner. By emphasizing Christ's humanity he brings the audience into the story. Regardless of your religious beliefs, one can relate to Jesus, his ministry and what he is trying to accomplish. His actions are plausible and understandable. His preaching is simple, sensible and comprehensible. His suffering and anguish is pitiful; his resurrection miraculous. Here the movie is strongest. Unlike the Gibson film, the resurrection is given full treatment and concludes the movie on a positive note, which is appropriate. The story of Jesus Christ requires no embellishment; it speaks for itself. Jesus was born, conducted his ministry, was betrayed, and was sacrificed. This is how the story is depicted in this movie. What more should anyone expect?",positive

She is the most backwash actress of Bellwood, fake, show off and I hate her presence on celluloid.So kindly spare us.From the cinematic horror.Only neerja bhanot's mom character moved me by her acting skills.I hope from next time film makers will get real actors on the board than this actress",negative
Neerja,"Life has to be bigger not longer! The film, Neerja is a portrayal on the life of the courageous Neerja Bhanot, who sacrificed her life while protecting the lives of 359 passengers in 1986. The flight was hijacked by a terrorist organization in Karachi. How she bravely handled the situation is what the film has been made on.Director is the real hero of this movie. Ram Madhvani describes every part, every scene of the film very wonderfully. Along with the writers, he is not giving outside of the track and thus, this film is a gem of 2016! Shabana Azmi has done a fantabulous job in the character of Neerja's mother. Though, she has not much dialogues, but her expressions show her emotions, and they are very real that everyone was crying literally. When she gave a speech on Neerja in the end, I was not able to control my emotions. Tears were flowing continuously. She will be the winner of best supporting actress in the major award ceremony undoubtedly.Sonam Kapoor has given career best performance. She could've been portrayed her well. But, whatever she has given is acceptable. Yogendra Tikku as Neerja's father and Shekhar as Neerja's friend are good and suitable. The man who portrayed Khalil, the angriest terrorist, has done a fantastic job. He looks like a pure terrorist. Others are good, too.Music is given by Vishal Khurana and lyrics has been penned by Prasoon Joshi. All the songs are listenable again and again. Background score is also suitable and helps to build the terror as well as the excitement.Connection with Rajesh Khanna, Neerja's past describing her marriage issue, her father's advises, her handling of the passengers, her smartness of not taking the U.S. citizens' passports, her calmness, her love letter written by her lover, her love towards her duty, her sacrifice - everything is just so perfect. I'm no getting over from it. This is probably one of the best films of this year.I salute you from the bottom of my heart to Neerja Bhanot, the actual one. She has been rewarded Ashok Chakra by the government of India. Though, Airlift was a good one, but, this deserves support from the audience. This is definitely better than Airlift. Please, it's my humble request to all that go and watch out the story of the brave girl, Neerja. Her mother told that Neerja was prettier than Sonam. Yes, the photographs in the end credits give the approval to this statement. A girl, aged 23, lost her life while saving the passengers during her job.

Bhaag Milkha Bhaag,I don't really do this but I'd like to make an exception in this case. The movie is excellent. Great way of story telling. The story is about one man but he is not the only one who plays the role exceedingly well. After watching this I don't think any one who acted in this film was remotely bad. They all acted amazingly well and gave true justice to their own characters. Only drawback that i can mention here is the time. i think the movie is a bit too long.

And when I saw this, it really blew me away because it had many mixtures which made this movie work. First of all FARHAN AKHTER is at its best, no doubt its his best performance till date. It was like we were seeing real Milkha Singh on screen. Divya Dutta is awesome, Pavan Malhotra, Yograj Singh & Prakash Raj have really performed well. Sonam Kapoor is completely waste though her role was very little, so you won't miss her. Rebecca Breeds looks fabulous, Dilip Tahil as Jawahar Lal Nehru was not a master stroke.

One Chance,"Starting with the movie synopsis, he was NEVER an opera singer 'by night' throughout the entire movie, and only sang for an operatic company near the end of the film when even then he only sang in the beginning of Aida until he went unconscious due to his stupidity which he demonstrates throughout the movie. It is disrespectful to those of us who have struggled against the odds to become something we truly wanted to be by implying he did the same. The only reason he even entered the contest at the end was because his wife was at her wits end with his lack of motivation to sing, although the movie does make it clear that he was well motivated to eat. Ironically, it is implied that his obesity was the main reason he was harassed while growing up, and only those who feel pity for him because of this would see some kind of justification for his eventual success in spite of his gullet.",negative
One Chance,"I saw the film One Chance prior to it's official USA opening, at the Aspen Film Festival, where it received enthusiastic applause and cheering from the audience. Although I am a long-time fan of its subject, British operatic tenor Paul Potts, it is not just ""good if you like Paul Potts"" but really, really good for anyone. Tony-award winner James Corden is excellent as Paul Potts, as is the rest of the cast, and the film is a first-class production all round. It is heartwarming and inspirational--and humorous--as it tells the story of a man who was born with an immense talent but bullied all his life for being ""different."" It is full of gorgeous music and full of romance as it follows the story of Paul and his wife, through difficulties--almost unbelievable, except it's true--that almost forced him to give up his dream, until it all came down to just One Chance to make his dreams come true. I would give it more than ""two thumbs up"" if I had more thumbs!",positive

Nothing they showed about suryaji brother of tanhaji. After tanhaji dies suryaji leads the battle. Shivaji maharaj did not came in the battle when tanhaji was dying.

Freeheld,"In a time when our nation is going through some the most progressive and long overdue changes in history, a film as timely as ""Freeheld"" would be welcomed with open arms and minds from critics and audiences. Unfortunately, what director Peter Sollett creates, in partnership with Academy Award nominated screenwriter Ron Nyswaner, is an uninspired, insipid, and downright cheap take on a same-sex couple fighting for death benefits.Starring recently Oscar-crowned Julianne Moore and Ellen Page, the two manage decent chemistry and maneuver through generic and Lifetime movie-like lines. The impressive Michael Shannon does his very best to elevate all the material, showing the if you're talented enough, no script can hold you back. On the hand, the rest of the cast, particularly Steve Carell, is so over-the-top, and poorly guided, that everything that could have made ""Freeheld"" a spectacular and moving drama, is quickly transformed into a distorted and tragic version of the Oscar-winning short that the film is based on. The most novice filmmakers could have created something more gratifying.""Freeheld"" tells the story of New Jersey police lieutenant, Laurel Hester (Moore), and her registered domestic partner, Stacie Andree (Page). When Laurel is diagnosed with terminal cancer, both battle to secure Hester's pension benefits.After just winning her long overdue Academy Award for last year's ""Still Alice,"" the excitement and anticipation for Julianne Moore's next role was at an all-time high. Moore, as we come to expect, commits firmly to the role of a dying woman. Reminiscent of performances like Hilary Swank in ""Million Dollar Baby,"" Moore dives into her psyche, offering her soul to a woman who lived her life with secrets, and became alive in her later years. While Nyswaner's script offers little insight into Laurel and Stacie's love, outside of montages and cancer treatments, Moore finds her way through the pitfalls to come out on the other side intact. Page, who was a strong voice in getting the picture made, is relegated to crying and awkward ticks. Several instances, we are led to believe that ""this scene"" will be ""her scene"" where she gets the chance to let loose and show us what she's all about. Once again, Sollett's plain and boring direction quickly cut her every scene short, and offer no room to explore her character's surroundings and feelings. It's a terrible waste of talent.Michael Shannon delivers a competent and layered performance as Dane, Laurel's cop partner. He finds the humanity and conflict in Dane's misunderstanding about Laurel's lifestyle and later in the fight for equality. He's the film's key positive note. Carell's over-the-top yelling and mannerisms is among the worst acting examples seen in 2015. It's as if Sollett decided to let ""Michael Scott"" from ""The Office"" run amok on the set because that's all that Carell manages to evoke. One year after a career-topping work in ""Foxcatcher,"" I'm embarrassed that this is his next venture for the world to behold.Even down to the cheesy score by Hans Zimmer, nothing about ""Freeheld"" sings. It lays dormant in a small courtroom, where anger and inspiration are supposed to fly but lies lifeless among the picket signs and Josh Charles' snarls. I was sincerely hoping for something better, actually something magnificent; too bad there's not enough vision to bring this powerful story to life.",negative
Freeheld,"If you've already seen Philadelphia (1993, with Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington), you'll watch Freeheld and have a feeling of déjà vu. Written by the same screenwriter, Ron Nyswaner, Freeheld has all the elements of its predecessor: (i) it's inspired by true events, (ii) the main character has a disease and enters into a legal battle while sick, and (iii) there is a lot of prejudice against homosexuals. Despite all the similarities, Philadelphia is superior, and I'll try to explain why.As Tom Hanks in Philadelphia, we see Julianne Moore transforms physically as the disease progresses. She always gives great performances, but I felt like I enjoyed it more during the first act, when she was struggling to keep her relationship a secret. Ellen Page is also great, especially when she's defied by her future boss who doesn't believe she can work repairing cars because she's a woman.Having said that, the best character, in my opinion, is Dane Wells (Michael Shannon), Laurel's partner in the police who struggles with himself when he finds out she's gay, but ends up helping her. Steve Carell is also in the cast and he was very applauded by the audience in the session I was in. He definitely gave the film a lighter and funnier tone, since it's clearly a tearjerker.Philadelphia had a different effect on me because the characters involved are more complex: the audience knows why Tom Hanks' character was fired, but the discussion is deeper than ""because he's gay"". In Freeheld, on the other hand, we see the ""Freeholders"" discussing Laurel's request behind close doors and their decision is simple and fast, with no further questions (except for Josh Charles' character). So, even though we all knew the ending to both films before they actually end, Freeheld felt like an old formula to me. Full review: http://wp.me/p5Rk4c-em",positive
Chhapaak,"The story could be accurate but it sadly isn't. The lawyer in real life events was given no real credit for her fight ! But let's forget the facts for a moment and enjoy the movie one would think ... The direction is poor and the movie feels like something emotionally charged than a message. Honestly a one time watch movie and you wouldn't be able to handle it another time ! Here's a suggestion for south indians with a similar storyline... Watch the malayalam movie ""Uyare"" and you'll be much more satisfied than this supposedly true story !!
But hey ! This movie will make you rethink about everything that's wrong with our cheap minded society !! Watch it for a message...ignore it for the facts !!",negative
Chhapaak,The year has started but i can already say that Chhapaak is probably the best film of 2020. From the impactful storyline to the amazing performance by Deepika as Maalti. This is probably her best performance as of now. Great cinematography and narration style.,positive
The Good Lie,Every RELEVANT character in this movie did a sensational job! the only down side was throwing Reese Witherspoon in this complex situation. The whole time I'm trying to enjoy the story and the struggle of these incredible characters and the only thing i saw out of Witherspoon is that she is completely out of her element and deep down she knows it. If this movie is to get any Oscar recognition...Reese will be it's only downside! That being said.... Learn some editing techniques and cut out all scenes with Witherspoon and it will still make sense and add more credibility to the film. Finally i need to decide who to blame...the writer (i doubt it) the directer (unlikely) the producers and studios??!! enough said.,negative
The Good Lie,"I literally just got home from the movie right now and this is the very first thing I do. Rate 10 and write this review.The movie premiered today in my country, Cambodia. And guess how many people had show up??? 1. It was me.... Lol. I honestly sit the entire movie theatre alone. Yes, I am a horror films fan and that creep me out very much. However, this is the very good opportunity for me to enjoy the film alone without those annoying cinema's rat people. I can laugh, cry loudly without worrying nobody. My country's people is not a drama fan... They probably squeezing each other at the comedy's and action's section.Oh right.... the film is a masterpiece. The storyline and scenery, the cast and everything about the film is just wonderful. It's like one of the most beautiful film I have ever seen since Blackswan. This film should win an Oscar just for its existing. The storyline was beautiful. And the fact that it is real made me cry even more. At the beginning of the film it was so so touching and sad, and then it made me laugh somewhere in the middle, and it ended with me crying like a baby alone in the theatre. Like literally. The cast performance is wonderful. They should probably need to win some awards or i'll hate everyone.The film ended, and I walk out alone from the entire theatre, with red eyes, tear all over my face and every single cinema's employees stare at me like what wrong with this guy LOL. And I drove home thinking about the movie and cry some more. And yes, just like after Blackswan, it took me at least a few hours for me to recover from the film's effects.",positive
Bitva za Sevastopol,"Watching of this movie ended for me after 40 seconds, when i realized it has been dubbed like from the best Soviet days...
We are in 2018! Learn that you dont have to do it and just use subtitles!Everything else is so badly under the shadow of this that it is not even worthy of mention!",negative
Bitva za Sevastopol,"Although it's mostly in Russian with subtitles, I was drawn in deeply and remained so throughout the duration. This is the most gripping WW2 film I've seen since Saving Private Ryan. The direction, acting, cinematography are all top notch. It tells the story of heroic Russian sniper without glamorizing war. Instead the horror of war is pervasive and though she is a survivor her story is tragic. It's also very interesting to get a glimpse of Stalin-era Soviet culture. It's a must see for anyone interested in WW2, history, biographies, or intense drama.",positive
The Program,"My review is very much written from the point of view of a cycling fan and rider who has followed the story for nearly 2 decades. I have to declare that I have a more sympathetic and favourable view of Lance Armstrong and Michele Ferrari than others.Overall, The Program is a flawed and poorly researched biopic full of inaccuracies and misconceptions. The movie tries to cram a lot of events over 13 years in without presenting it in a clear and coherent way for the audience. The film is almost wholly one sided and does not tell the whole story. Its protagonist, David Walsh is portrayed as an innocent journalist who walked into the evidence rather than someone who spent a decade trying to destroy Armstrong and cycling through methods not too dissimilar to its key antagonist. The story does not tell of how Walsh harassed, pushed and entrapped some of the witnesses including the Andreus into a corner and force them to come out against Lance and their friends against their will. It also glorifies irresponsible journalism, Walsh wrote the damning LA Confidentiel without hard evidence and purely basing on his gut, accounts from his sources and inadmissible evidence. The fact that he turned out to be largely right does not make him a hero or what he did to be right and the film does not reflect that in anyway. I won't go into the Armstrong story in too much detail except to say that Lance was portrayed as the doper and at times the only one driving the doping. The fact is everyone of his rivals doped and he was as much of a product of his time and situation than anything else.The science and history behind the story was so lazy and badly researched it was laughable. If VO2max is the only determinant of performance, why do we bother having the races and wouldn't young Oskar Svendsen be the most successful rider ever? Then the film celebrates the fact that Walsh predicted he would be a great one day rider and he couldn't win races in Europe...when the truth was Armstrong at the time when he first met Walsh was already world champion, the most prestigious one day race in the world and had won it in Oslo before his 22nd birthday.Finally, it is a real shame the way Michele Ferrari was portrayed...in essence like a shady drug pusher with a French accent. Canet looks like a villain from the 60s Batman than a middle aged Italian physician. The real world truth is that Michele Ferrari is the most brilliant sports physician of his time, his methods may or may not have been ethical but his aim was like many human scientists to push boundary of our race and in the spirit of how we evolved through the ages. Check out his articles on 53x12.com, even the public research and knowledge and new ground is so inspirational and insightful it is quite amazing.The truth is I see The Program as a fable on modern media, where it has the power to build you up and then tear you down if it sells. Cycling has paid for its sins many times over but it is by no means the dirtiest sport, the standards of testing and controls even back in the really dark ages of the 80s and 90s is so much ahead of other sports like NFL, soccer, athletics, tennis etc. I will always love the sport of cycling both as a fan and as a rider, it enriches so many people's lives that I really hate people who tries to destroy it, especially to create headlines and sell newspapers/books.",negative
The Program,"But I must confess to not being a supremely dedicated cycling fan and wasn't aware of the details of Armstrong's case prior to watching this so part of my entertainment was fuelled by finding out more about what actually happened and went on, and I can appreciate you may feel differently if you already know the details",positive
Kilo Two Bravo,"I was recommended this by a fellow ex-serviceman as I'm usually pretty weary of this stuff. It is a little bit slow to start. (But then life in the Army can be like that.) Then it go's wrong spectacularly quickly. (Life in the Army can definitely be like that.) If you haven't served in the British forces you might not get this film, at one point I was sat quietly crying when a guy spat out a one liner that had me in creases. I won't go in to the old ""them and us"" bit, comparing British soldiers to American soldiers, suffice to say that these guys are very understated hero's. No hullabaloo, no histrionics just guts and above all a camaraderie that cannot be replicated anywhere else. But don't take my word for it, judge for yourself. Please.",negative
Kilo Two Bravo,"I like war films. Not because I like war, but since it happens I'd like to know more about it. This film isn't like ""Platoon"", ""Hamburger Hill"", ""Saving Private Ryan"" or any other such ""Movies"". This film isn't like a movie at all. It is so real that it sucks you into every moment as though you were actually there. After the character development, I was literally on the edge of my seat, with my elbows on my knees with my hands holding my cheeks. I saw it at home, so thankfully I was able to pause it to make a cocktail; I needed one because it was that serious. Other war films I have seen and liked; they seem like popcorn fodder compared to this one. I was so engrossed in the progression and actually became angry at war itself like I have never felt before. I wasn't aware it was a true story until the end credits and I cried then. I was emotional throughout the film, not even knowing this. It was so real that I talked not only to myself, but to the characters I was watching.Thankfully, there were no ""shaky cameras"" like ""Inglorious Bastards"", making it easy to concentrate on what was really going on. What was going on was disturbing and humbling at the same time. Every scene and every incidence was relevant. I don't even call this film a ""movie"", because it is better than that. I have never given 10/10 to any film and rarely write reviews, but this one is deserving of a 15/10 if that were possible. If you have any reservations about watching this film, cast them aside and view it. Every aspect of what a perfect film would be about is included in this one. It's not a family film or for those who faint easily. It is gripping, extremely graphic, truthful and simply a masterpiece of cinema. It is deserving of the Academy Award for ""Best Picture"", ""Best Director"", ""Best Screenplay"", ""Best Actor"", Best Supporting Actor"", ""Best Cinematography"", ""Best Editing"", ""Best Makeup"", and of all the films I have ever seen, I put this one on the top of my list, and that isn't an easy feat. With my child love of the ""Wizard Of Oz"" and my insatiable lust for ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Wars"", this film has dethroned all of them. This is the best film I have ever seen in my life.",positive
Experimenter,"I am a completely ignorant of Stanley Milgram's and his work, I wasn't really sure what I was getting into when I picked this movie last night outside of knowing it was a biopic. I actually watched this film with friends and we were found ourselves talking about it long afterwards.Peter Sarsgaard, does very well portraying the somewhat dispassionate and yet intelligent Milgram. There is a deep intelligence in this man, and a yearning to understand why we act the way we do when authority is imposed on ourselves, yet there is a severe emotional disconnect between implementing his experiments and discussing the fruits of his labor. When describing and explaining his work, he certainly does so in a very straightforward manner, but what the results say much about us as individuals and as a society. They certainly are noteworthy and it explains why he became such a noteworthy person in media and in the psychiatric world. Winona Ryder plays his loyal and supportive wife, who although may question his methods at times, certainly stands by his side throughout the events in this film. Several notable actors portray colleagues, participants, and other persons of interest throughout the film and add real talent and depth in the cast.There were some film experiments going on in the film itself, in terms of direction and visual representation of ideas. Milgram directly addresses the audience at times, breaking the rules of the '4th wall' by acknowledging you directly at the beginning of the film. At other times he breaks mid scene to address you again. There is a visual representation of the 'elephant in the room' when he discusses difficult topics that explain some of his more controversial methods during the early 60's. A flat 2 dimensional backdrop was used when visiting his old colleague and mentor, perhaps to represent a dull and somewhat awkward afternoon tea with someone he may have actually despised. Some of these methods were interesting, but most felt like a juxtaposition for the rest of the movie that was filmed in a much more typical manner.The questions raised by Migram's experiments are important ones. Why do we blindly follow orders? When do we take responsibility for our own actions? What percentage of people will say no and stand up to authority? His work had a common theme about human nature, and the results of which are somewhat disturbing and controversial to understand. They often display a dispassionate and often cruel side of ourselves, and that can be the most difficult answer to recognize.An interesting film and worth your time if you are curious about his life and works.6/10",negative
Experimenter,"Science and Psychology in Academia and Art are not usually Associated.

Verbally, the Script is Played out in typical, Dry, Academics.

Mr. Turner,"Amazing Movie! My husband and I saw it yesterday and LOVED IT! I am an American who owns all of Mike Leigh's films. His films are one of a kind! They give you a glimpse into people's lives. Either an historical person or in most of his films he shows us regular everyday people. The cinematography is breathtaking. This movie made me feel as if I had traveled back in time and I actually felt like I was watching Turner go about his day to day life. It was fascinating to me and not just to see his life but to watch how people ate, dressed, partied, spoke and the interworking of their relationships . It also gave us a glimpse into different social classes at that period in time in England. When I came out of the movie I felt as if I had been there with the character at that time. It gave me so much more than any other movie experience has! BRAVO MIKE LEIGH!!!!!!!!",negative
Mr. Turner,"We always knew that ""Mr Turner"" would not be a conventional costume picture any more than it would be a conventional biopic. It is, after all, a Mike Leigh film and Mr Leigh doesn't do 'conventional'. Of course, he normally concerns himself with the vagaries of contemporary middle-class culture, poking fun at, and then finding the bleeding heart of, the little people who inhabit his very personal world. (Leigh is, perhaps, the only writer/director who can crack us up and break our hearts simultaneously).""Mr Turner"" isn't the first time he has looked to the past nor to real historical figures for his material. With ""Topsy-Turvy"" he created the world of Gilbert and Sullivan and 'The Mikado'. As musical biopics go it is, perhaps, unique. Now with ""Mr Turner"" he takes us deep into the life of William Turner, arguably the first great 'modern' painter and almost certainly the greatest of all English painters, and in doing so has created the least stuffy costume picture I have ever seen. Of the several masterpieces Leigh has given us ""Mr Turner"" may be the finest.It begins when Turner was already in middle-age and established as England's premier painter and it follows him until his death. It reveals him to be a man of many contradictions, sharing his later life mainly with two women, (he had long since disregarded his shrewish wife and grown-up daughters whose very existence he always denied). For sexual favours he turned to his housekeeper Hannah Danby while preferring the company of the widow Mrs Booth with whom he lodged part of the year in Margate, (Danby never knew of Booth's existence until just before Turner's death). He could be both cruel and kind in equal measure, both to his contemporaries and to those he professed to care about and he certainly had a temper.We don't learn a great deal about his technique as a painter though we do see him, briefly, at work, including a wonderful scene, one of several great set-pieces, where he adds a daub of paint to one of his canvases at the Royal Academy's Exhibition. It's not really that kind of film. Leigh is more interested in observing the man and getting inside his skull and in this he is greatly helped by Timothy Spall's magnificent performance as Turner, capturing the man mostly in a series of grunts. Spall's Turner doesn't go for deep, philosophical conversations on the nature of art. He seems happiest making small-talk with Mrs Booth and when, in another of the film's great set-pieces, the conversation veers into the critical appraisal of a fellow artist he is quick to debunk the pretentious John Ruskin who obviously likes the sound of his own lisping voice.Spall, of course, is just the lynch-pin of a terrific ensemble. No-one puts a foot wrong, (including Leigh regulars Ruth Sheen and Lesley Manville), but one must really single out Dorothy Atkinson as the unfortunate and much maligned Danby and Marion Bailey as Mrs Booth. Both women are superb, giving us characters that are much more than mere historical sketches. There is something deeply moving in their silent acceptance of Turner's foibles, (and while Leigh's dialogue is splendidly 'of the period', it's often in the silences that the film is most effective). Credit, too, to Dick Pope's superb cinematography which captures perfectly the paintings without seeming in any way slavish. Indeed, of all films made about artists this may be the finest. I don't doubt for a moment that it's a masterpiece.",positive
Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom,"Mandela: Long Way To Freedom (English): The film which is releasing in India after 2 months (24 January 2014) of it's international release (a week before Nelson Mandela's death), is indeed a nice cinematic outing based on the Classic Hollywood narrative style. Despite the film losing it's track while focusing more on the life and times of Late Nelson Mandela, the film scores with it's screenplay (William Nicholson) based on the autobiography written by the legend himself, then comes the production designing work by Johnny Breedt, whose brilliantly portrays the Apartheid times on screen, the cinematography by Lol Crawly whose shots brilliantly bring out the best of the legend and his times and then the proper placement of music score as well as the archival footages within the film's coarse, the the performances by the lead. The best among them comes the performance by Idris Elba who greatly delivers a performance that's worth cherishing and successfully brings out the portrayal of Madiba well and then comes the narration by the director Justin Chadwick, who keeps you engaged and sympathize with the film's journey to freedom. Not to be missed! My rating would be: 4/5.﻿",negative
Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom,"This is a film that is difficult to judge simply in cinematic terms since the subject is such a titanic figure in recent history, many older viewers (such as me) will have lived through most of the events depicted, and Nelson Mandela himself - the prisoner who became a president - unknowingly heightened the interest around his life by dying just weeks before the film was released. Yet, allowing for all of this, by any standards ""Mandela"" is a success, telling a powerful story in a honest and immensely moving manner with some outstanding acting. If it is somewhat reverential, this was to be expected, given the subject and the timing.Unfashionably for recent bio-pics, ""Mandela"" chooses not to concentrate on a seminal incident in the subject's life but to paint on a huge canvas, covering many decades and lots of political events in a linear narrative that frequently deploys news clips from the time. It is based on Mandela's long 1995 biography of the same name which I bought on a visit to Robben Island and read with great admiration. British William Nicholson (""Gladiator"") has done a skillful job of turning such a huge story into a manageable script and British director Justin Chadwick (""The Other Boleyn Girl"") handles a complex of ingredients with genuine talent. It looks good with attention to period clothing and artifacts and use of actual sites and some breathtaking countryside (it was shot entirely on location in South Africa).Ultimately, however, the success of such an ambitious work rests especially on the lead actors and the casting here was inspired. Idris Elba as the eponymous hero gives a towering performance, while Naomie Harris is a revelation as the more complex and less sympathetic character of his second wife Winnie. It helps that both are not major stars - although that is now set to change - and notable that both are British actors who affect convincing accents.This is a balanced portrayal of multi-layered characters. Mandela is represented with great respect but he is not offered to us as a saint. He treats his first wife unkindly and his support for violence is not disguised. The film really impresses with its representation of Winnie, a woman who suffered so much, hated so much, and herself caused so much injustice. Mandela is now dead but his great project - the creation of a peaceful and prosperous multiracial nation - is still a work in progress.",positive
Embrace of the Serpent,"Interesting look at the lifestyle of the Amazon people in the vanishing jungle where a shaman deals with two diverse characters , being first Colombian film nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film .

As decades apart , an Amazonian shaman and last survivor of his people , and two scientists who work together over the course of 40 years to search the Amazon for a sacred healing flower . It's based on two true stories, linked together by one remarkable man and , perhaps, the most famous, celebrated river in the world, the Amazon . And the man is Karamakate, the last shaman of his jungle tribe . We first meet him in 1940 , deep into his sixties as played by Antonio Bolivar, when he encounters a man foreign to his home, an American scientist Richard Evans Schultes (Brionne Davis) . The rain forest of the Amazon are disappearing at the rate of 5000 acres day . Four million Indians once lives there , nowadays 120.000 remain .Embrace Of The Serpent is one such cinematic experience which brought a deserved Academy Award Nomination . Ecological thriller that has in highlighting the destruction of the South American rain woods by the rubbers ; being based upon a real story , on diaries by scientists Theodor Koch-Grunberg and Richard Evan Schultes , both of whom delve into the Amazonian rainforest in search of a rare plant with medicinal and hallucinatory qualities, with the assistance of a local shaman on opposite ends of his own life journey . An ecological adventure with mystical touches that was ahead of its time in denounce about forest destruction , including some disconcerting scenes , as the frames where a man is praised to be the Messiah is based on an actual event . Embrace of the Serpent attempts to frame the destruction of the rain forest's ecology and peoples as a slow-motion tragedy on scales both personal and cultural , but it is more intriguing in its ambitions, which frustrate it, than in it successes, which are limited . This exciting film contains thrills , emotion , adventure and marvelous scenes from deep rainy forest that generate a lot of surprises and illusion . This film has got some images ""stuck in their head"" including several sequences can stay in your brain for a long, long while . Glamorous and lush cinematography by David Gallego who photographs wonderfully the Amazon jungle , obviously filmed under difficult conditions on location . Shot in black-and-white, which is at once visually distinctive but also rather flattening . Evocative musical score by Nascuy Linares and the music Evan plays on the gramophone is Haydn's ""The Creation"". This engrossing and enjoyable film with interesting screenplay by Ciro Guerra and Jacques Toulemonde Vidal was well directed by Ciro Guerra .

Embrace of the Serpent,"......................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL It isn't much of a leap to venture that the vast majority of IMDb Users have never seen a Colombian Film. If there is a single word in the above Title that grabs you, rest assured, you must ""EMBRACE"" this Oscar-nominated gem by placing it at the top of your ""Must See"" List! Colombian Director Ciro Guerra (Los Viajes del Viento/read my Review) has taken an Amazonian Shaman's reality-based Dream and crafted it into a visionary cinematic hallucination for the ages! The operative term here is ""Culture-Clash"". Two delicately intertwined story lines, both inspired by travel journals authored three decades apart by two Amazonian explorers; German scientist Theodor Koch-Grunberg (Jan Bijvoet, ""Borgman""), in 1909, and by American amateur botanist Richard Evans Schultes (Brionne Davis, ""Avenged""), thirty years later. EMBRACE opens a gritty and convincingly realistic window into the Colombian Amazon Region of the early 20th Century. Guerra gets up close and personal with some of the persistent cultural atrocities perpetrated on indigenous peoples in the Amazon region of Colombia, without dwelling inordinately on them. As if the three plus centuries of Spanish Colonial Rule had not provided enough genocide and torture!For those of you addicted to ""Fast and Furious"" pacing in movies, undoubtedly, will find EMBRACE a bit ""Tedious and Slow"", but I would say, ""Deliberate and True to Life"". One can, at best, barely imagine the laid- back life rhythms in remote regions of the Amazon a century ago! The intentional ever-so-slightly grainy Black & White cinematography imbues EMBRACE with an authentic 1930's look and feel. Of course, there have been numerous critiques of thusly having deprived us of the myriad of Amazon shades of greenBut EMBRACE is not a Travel Promo and I applaud Ciro Guerra's Black & White decision! Here is a comment/comparison you probably might not see anywhere else: Although Director Ciro Guerra was born in 1981, I can't help but think that, as a kid, he saw and was influenced by Stanley Kubrick's 1968, ""2001"" (My Favorite Movie)! There were, in my opinion, a number of interesting parallels, confirmation of which I will leave up to you! Shaman Karamakate, the last survivor of his tribe (Nibio Torres-young/Antonio Bolivar-old) who has been chewed up and spit out as a lifelong victim of culture clash, and, as a result, defines himself as ""chullachaqui"", a walking empty shell zombie of a man.EMBRACE is light years from being a feel-good movie, yet, there is a ""spirituality and focus which can help you transcend even a worst- case scenario of mistreatment and misfortune in life"", that is transformational and which provides ground swelling inspiration! This unique film would probably appeal to those who crave unusual true stories, those of you who enjoy Drama focused on a Clash of Cultures, and movies set in exotic locations! 10*.....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!",positive
Denial,"What hit me was the line by Tom Wilkinson - ""Why has there not been a proper scientific study of this whole siteby reputable scientistsfifty years after the fact?""

Denial,"the movie is poorly written with a soul intention of defaming one person and possibly to show what happen to holocaust deniers. the makers of the movie didn't realize that the people who knew nothing or have very little knowledge about holocaust actually will become more skeptic rather than sympathetic.i am not a sympathizer of David irving and frankly i never knew him before this movie. watching this movie one thing was clear, the writer was clearly biased against David irving by not showing his part of argument.the movie was based on a case which was carefully constructed by powerful lawyers team against one defenseless person and their strategy to proving him a liar instead of countering his claim with facts. at the end of the trial all they managed to prove that Irving was an anti-semite and did manipulate the fact but the point of whether holocaust actually happened or not remain a question.i watched this movie hoping that there will be trials based on facts to prove and historical event but sadly i am very disappointed.the only good thing about the movie is the acting of lead actors. Rachel weisz was exceptionally good. Tom Wilkinson, Timothy Spall and Andrew Scott did a good job",positive
Danny Collins,"DANNY COLLINS (2015)Al Pacino as aging rockstar Danny Collins seemed weirdly miscast to me, but hey, it's Pacino and he pulled it off in movie star style. This story was loosely inspired by an event in folk singer Steve Tilson's life: Tilson recieved an encouraging letter from John Lennon, (with Lennon's phone number on it), decades after it was sent. He wonders how it might have changed his life if he got the letter at the time it was written. In this film, the rocker goes through a Hollywood movie sort of change and goes to New Jersey to make things right with a son he never met. In fact, in real life Tilson has several children that he has solid relationships with. The cast, including Annette Bening, Jennifer Garner, Bobby Cannavale, and Christopher Plummer, all turn out solid performances, (Bening is fantastic, actually), but the enjoyable movie never catches fire with me. I thought it was good, but not great; easy to watch, but it felt contrived and not deeply memorable to me.",negative
Danny Collins,"Greetings again from the darkness. He who was once Michael Corleone is now Danny Collins. With a career spanning 40 plus years with 8 Oscar nominations, including a win for Scent of a Woman, Al Pacino must be considered Hollywood royalty. Upon closer analysis, that last nomination and win came more than 20 years ago, and he is now the go-to guy for a demonstrative, (more than a) few years past his prime type. So on paper, we get why Pacino was cast as Danny Collins (think modern day Neil Diamond).The film begins with a very young Collins being interviewed by a rock journalist (Nick Offerman) after the release of his first album. Flash forward 40 years, and Collins has made a career of re-hashing the same songs to the same concert goers. He lives in a mansion, throws lavish parties, has a fiancé who could be his granddaughter, and absorbs coke and booze between flights on his private jet. It's only now that Frank (Christopher Plummer), his agent and best friend, presents him with a long lost letter written to Collins by John Lennon after that interview so many years before. Cue the bells and whistles  it's time for a redemption road trip.It's only at this point that we understand the cute ""kind of based on a true story"" tag at the opening credits. See, Lennon did write a letter in 1971 to British Folk Singer Steve Tilston, and the letter did take many years to find its way to him. However, Tilston never lost his creative vision the way that Danny Collins did (otherwise, there would be no movie).What happens next is predictable and a bit formulaic. Colllins tracks down his adult son (Bobby Cannavale) from an early career backstage fling, and does all he is capable of doing to cannonball into his life, and that of his wife (Jennifer Garner) and young daughter (Giselle Eisenberg). Expect the usual TV melodramatics as far as disease and suburban family challenges, and tie-in a flirty back-and-forth with the Hilton manager (Annette Benning), and you can pretty much fill in the blanks for the balance of the film.Cannavale and Plummer certainly do everything they can to elevate the storyline. Cannavale's emotions are all over the place as one would expect and he is the most believable of all characters. Plummer adds a sense of reality and humor to his interludes with Pacino – wisely controlling his movements against Pacino's histrionics.Stories involving a characters seeking redemption have one thing in common  a character who is not so likable. We never really buy him as the aging rock star, or even as the once promising songwriter, but we do buy him as the guy who was too busy for his family and is clumsy and unaware of the pain he causes, even while trying to do the right thing.Writer/director Dan Fogelman takes few risks in his first shot at directing. His past writing includes the excellent Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011) and the not so excellent Last Vegas (2013). His common theme seems to be the emotional struggle of men, and we definitely know that's an unsolved mystery. His effort here may not be a bull's-eye, but it's not without some merit – despite the Pacino distraction.",positive

M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story,"Right now maybe everyone should agree on this, Neeraj Pandey is one of the most talented directors of the Bollywood. He has made some outstanding films and this is also a very good film. His all of the films are thriller genre and he is right now a master of the thriller movie. His previous ventures ""A Wednesday"", ""Special 26"" and ""Baby"" all of this 3 movies are highly appreciated by the critics and the audiences. This movie is not a complete thriller movie, Moreover this movie is a biography. But just you think when biography meets with the thriller genre, what will happen? Exactly!!! A very good enjoyable movie. This movie has all the elements what you like to watch. Sports, Drama, Emotion, Action, Suspense and thriller. the perfect combination of all of this.I am not revealing the story of this movie. You all know Mr. Mahendra Sing Dhoni. He is the captain of Indian Cricket team of Limited version. You know his career in cricket and you know his contribution to Indian cricket. But you don't know his untold story and how he came here and how he made his fame. This is a very emotional journey and very encourageable for everyone.We all only see how a player plays on the ground but we don't want to know his struggle and his hidden story. This movie tells the hidden story of Mr. Dhoni and reveals his actual character. I am not telling the story but you may think biography movie is not enjoyable. But believe me, this movie will demolish your previous experience about this genre and definitely you will enjoy this. Good storyline, Very good script, Outstanding direction and very good acting made this a good enjoyable one. If you feel bored after watching Raaz 4 and Pink, go catch this movie. You will not regret.",negative
M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story,"one star - dhoni haters. loll even if the movie is too go0d. they will never accept it , just like the Pakistan not trying to accept the surgical strike operation by Indian army. 10 star - dhoni lovers. ignore that too , the movie may be good but it cannot be like a 10 star. what you should do ? Go watch the movie yourself and come back here with a genuine comment.asking me why i rated this 10 star ? of course i wont do it. but look at the haters , they just simply putting one star for no reason. to neutralise it , i voted 10 stars loll. of course dhoni have haters but he have 10000 x fans when compared to his haters. otherwise how on earth this movie have 8+ ratings. it should be 2- , if he not had 10000 x fans base xd.personal opinion about dhoni : i like dhoni , but i am not his fan nor a hater. i like him and i don't like some of his decisions ( there is a lot of difference between don't like his decisions and don't like him at all ). yes , he disappointed me many times but he also entertained me when there is no hope. this movie will be worth if he lead India to another victory #world cup 2019",positive
The End of the Tour,"The End of the Tour is not a film about David Foster Wallace, so much as it is a carefully crafted love note to him and his complication. And to that end, it openly professes its loyalty to the disenfranchised, over-educated members of the audience. At a Cruz in the film we hear Wallace offer his opinions on depression and addiction, but these are no doubt Lipskys own feelings, and given to Wallace in screen to give them more credibility. Wallace is portrayed as a man looming large with first-world-problems, and Jason Segel's Wallace remains affably antisocial throughout the affair. Still, whatever is compelling about the film exists within the writing, but not necessarily the actual story.The film is not, in fact, based so much Wallace but on Rolling Stones interviewer David Lipskys memoirs recounting of his five days with Wallace. Our plot is set up simply, with Lipskys credentials established as a newly published author, skeptical and jealous of Wallaces universal acclaim and the sole voice of inquiring literary minds at Rolling Stone magazine. After demanding of his editors to grant him the freedom of an interview (in a scene that included, I s*** you not, the Perry White via Lois lane line delivery of ""There better be a Story!""), Lipsky then embarks on cinemas least funny buddy comedy, complete with planes, trains and automobiles.The screenwriter, Donald Margulies, is an accomplished playwright, a profession suited best to find drama in what is essentially a lot of talking. To this end, he does an adequate job of making us interested, but the character development feels too compressed at times. There are moments even, when the story starts to feel like it wished it was the intellectualized parallel to Cameron Crowes Almost Famous, but never has the decency to be a clearly fictionalized. Wallace is written as the more complex character, but it's clear this is Lipsky's story and he's riding Wallaces back. Eisenberg is unintentional in lacking the dimension to convey this, while Segel's portrayal continually rings true. As Wallace loosens to Lipsky throughout the movie, he reaches our climax in three notes. First, while our duo is in a moment of confrontation, Wallace spouts the values of remaining grounded against his ever growing fame. The second is his diatribes on addictions and the romance associated with them, and lastly, a confessional late night summery of his neurosis. It's a brilliant inclusion by the screenwriter and director to allow room for melodic musing, broadening the appeal of any given insights.The Director, James Ponsoldt, does a fine job of framing the travels of the two, creating an intimacy that most likely never existed. The reality is that Ponsoldt doesn't have much to work with that isn't dramatized by Margulies, as those five days produced nothing of interest for Rolling Stone (The intended article was never published) nor did Lipsky feel compelled to expand upon it until Wallaces death 12 years later. I'm sure there's there's some clićhe to spout about why Lipsky sat so long on this story, but it feels ever the notion of timing, and good fortune on Lipskys part.",negative
The End of the Tour,"Rarely am I enlightened by a film in the way I was by this one. Not that I was lectured or taught something, but that I had a visceral response to what I had experienced on screen that I wouldn't be able to explain but to ask you to recall a song or a book or a show that invited you to pour your soul into it and in return reminded you of what it was like to have one. I was reminded that films can do this.I don't expect everyone to like it to the degree that I did because I can only base my strong inclination towards this movie on the connection I personally made with it which was emotional rather than intellectual, although the film is rich and lingering in its intellect as well, and of course; I recognize what makes this film profound, which I'll try to explain.This is a talky film from director James Ponsoldt, who I'd now have to rank as one of my favorite contemporary directors after this and another I've seen and loved, The Spectacular Now. This director isn't one you'd normally find on a list ranking among the greatest working today because he's not about style and doesn't appeal to the ego as much as other contemporaries such as Wes Anderson and David Fincher do (in addition to many others, not to single them out). No, Ponsoldt is subtle and reserves his ego. He is unimposing on the lives of his characters and candid about what his films are trying to do and say, not hiding beneath film rhetoric or allegory or the impression of a representational work. And what's great about this is how his films point out that you don't need intricate sets or perfectly symmetrical shots to create beauty. This film has some of the most beautiful shots I've seen (the shot of them walking in the snow, the shot of the normally- withdrawn Wallace dancing), all the more so because of their subtlety, giving the feeling that the beauty was discovered and not created by the director.But the beauty is often created by the actors. Ponsoldt trusts his actors and puts his efforts towards making the characters come alive before our eyes. I was under the fantastic impression that I was witnessing a completely real human soul with Segel's performance. He felt so real, so three dimensional. I understand him, even though I am not him. This is more magical to me than sweeping camera movements or extravagant art direction. I didn't realize when watching the film that the dialogue is all based on, if not directly taken from, the tapes journalist (and protagonist) David Lipsky (Eisenberg) recorded of his interviewee, universally acclaimed novelist David Foster Wallace (Segel). The dialogue is rich with insight into the character's thought processes and their observations on life (but mostly those of Wallace). I was riveted at every moment the two were talking, feeling as though being revealed before me were the truths of life. The thrill of being a fly on the wall. And it's not just the words containing the wisdom of the thoughtful and complicated Wallace, but the delivery via the actors and the way in which the many hours of tape are edited to allow Wallace's ideas and observations to resonate. Even beyond Wallace's ideas, the film cuts to the core and observes Wallace as a human being, not different for his brilliance but the same for his humanness.The film is about so many things it would be overwhelming to attempt list all of them. Its ideas, however many, are all-encompassing of what it means to exist, which is, beyond the desire for fame and ego-boosts, to want to be understood. The film observes how the inner-worlds of all people are so uniquely complicated and pays tribute to that wonder. I'll be relating my experiences to this film in time to come.",positive
Grace of Monaco,"I hope Hollywood would stop using famous and well-known actors to embody famous actors whose lives they pay homage to. As a viewer, my perception becomes too skewed with trying to remember who the homage is for and how well the actor is performing. I would love to imagine the honored person's life being played out in the big screen, if Hollywood doesn't mind. In my opinion, a less known or unknown look-alike would do that. Nicole Kidman is a beautiful actor but I couldn't imagine nor remember Princess Grace. Also, Nicole Kidman does NOT have Grace Kelly's facial bone structure nor the look in her eyes that made Grace Kelly so famous and loved. Now Tim Roth who played the role of Prince Rainier was just frustrating. Disappointing.",negative
Grace of Monaco,"Hahahaha I wonder why people are so comparing this movie with the real life of princess Grace, this is a movie of course not 100% of it depicts 100% real life story of a person. However this movie is excellent to realize one time event of life yup the event where France tried to overtake Monaco but indeed Grace managed to save the whole country and became awesome magnificent princess and mother of 2 for this movie. Nicole Kidman acting wonderfully well which showed great struggle between staying in a foreign literally different culture with her liberal ""freedom to speak"" culture hometown, she obviously succeed showing her emotions and grace as the old nobility where ""divorce"" was taboo at that time. Tim Roth as prince Reiner showing great chemistry with her while not losing his excellent skill of acting. Most of the actors in this movie are great cast with wonderful scenery and setting. The director succeed bringing the best of the actors' skill and kept me watching this movie until the end without a hint of boringness. I don't really know about the history of Grace Kelly and her family that well just knew her as a beautiful actress and a princess who loved her family dearly but through this movie I really admire her more since she could survive the bad phase of her life and conflicts even though it's not the end of her problems yet she continued her role model as a wonderful princess, wive, and mother.",positive
Million Dollar Arm,"Feel good, fun film, very predictable but still manages to hold attention thanks to its Indian flavor and the self-discovery some of the characters go through, particularly Jon Hamm.Jon is a sports agent down to his last throw of dice when he convinces a Chinese entrepreneur (Tzi Ma) to fund a search for new baseball pitcher from India's vast pool of cricket bowlers, setting it up as a talent hunt, criss-crossing the country. After many a hiccup, they finally narrow it down to 2 candidates, Suraj and Madhur and whisk them, along with Pitobash (a wanna be baseball coach, translator) to the USA to get them to train, get ready for a tryout in a very tight deadline. Things don't go exactly as planned and Jon at one point complains about having signed up for a talent contest, not to become a primary care-giver. His business partner, Aasif (remember him from Ghost Town ?) and tenant, Lake Bell, are the ones helping keep things on track, while Alan Arkin and Bill Paxton as the baseball scout and coach, try to help with their wise counsel, while Darshan Jariwala plays a cameo. This is a film that doesn't really go deep but keeps things moving while skimming through what the characters are going through. The adjustment issues – Jon's to India and then later for the Indian trio in America are humorously and quickly told. The relationship between Jon and Lake – beginning with a broken down washing machine, then Skype and later at home is crucial to the plot. And most fascinating of all is watching Jon's character, the deal hungry, self-centered sports agent, try and figure out what life is about – of course, with a few helpful nudges from friendsSport movies usually suffer from predictable endings and this one is no exception. It drags a bit in the second half too but the music score by A R Rahman helps gloss over that. It's a true story apparently but one, surprisingly not too many Indians are aware of, so in that sense, the chief objective of doing the talent hunt, to popularize baseball in India, doesn't really seem to have worked. Unfortunately, going by the low key promotion, release and the small crowds, even the film wont help do that hereMore at ApurvBollywood at blogspot",negative
Million Dollar Arm,"OK, I admit that you could probably predict the course of the movie just from seeing the trailer. However, this movie makes you forget about its predictability. The acting was superb, you really feel for the characters and what they are going through. You want them to succeed and surpass the adversities. With that being said, this movie will make you laugh, cry, and smile. It's just one of those feel good movies. In fact, the entire theatre audibly laughed and cheered on the boys. This is the first time I've ever seen a theatre audience so engaged in a movie. I recommend this movie for everyone. If you're looking for a feel good, charming movie, this is it!",positive
Tracks,"I haven't read the book so my movie watching wasn't tainted or supported by that memory. It could have been a really good movie but it was let down by a number of things that I found so irritating, while I watched it, that they drove me crazy! If I hadn't paid money for St George Open Air, I would have left. It is a terrible movie and I felt embarrassed being Australian if this were ever promoted to foreigners. The acting of the main character is horrible. She has the same two expressions throughout the entire movie. Pouty and more pouty. - Cinematography: there is raving about this in other reviews? Jeez, you know what you see? Camels feet then a wide fly in shot to, guess what? More camels feet. Rinse and repeat for the duration. Over and over and over. Camels feet - sky - camels feet - sky ... YAWN. Like a children's show. - At one point she loses her compass and follows the camel tracks backwards to the compass, but then ... you guessed it, she can't find her way back the camels and gets lost. What the? Next, the camels wander off but now she can't find them. Suddenly she can't see camel tracks or what? Who knows. You are left to guess at what might cause the next pouty face. Poor story telling. - Appears to be a blue screen of Uluru. - The movie, in general, totally lacked the colour and depth of the amazing desert and plant life that exists out there. It was clearly filmed on a very low budget in a very small area. It does not showcase the country. Anyone that says it showcases the outback, needs to actually go there themselves and not armchair review. - Not a traveloge, more like pictures from going round and round a large basin. - Narration would have helped the incessantly annoying pouty look.As for what the book may contain, this movie did not make me want to read it. The character conveyed in the movie was not pleasant or likable and there's no way I'd want to relive anything resembling this experience ever again. Tragically disappointing for all concerned.

Tracks,"After reading the book ""Tracks"", I found it difficult to imagine anyone being able to transfer it properly to cinema. Well, it took them years to do it, but thankfully they've achieved what seemed almost impossible. I saw ""Tracks"" yesterday and I found it truly moving. It's a beautiful film - not just in its transporting cinematography and landscapes, but beautiful for its truthfulness, its honesty. ""Tracks"" is both sublimely poetic and ruggedly authentic - it's emotionally raw. I didn't find one false note in the movie - no melodrama or stereotype characters that you see in most Hollywood films. Mia Wasikowska's performance demonstrates that old line from Keats, ""Beauty is truth, truth beauty"" - it's a great performance - the epitome of soulful. The journey is as much her character's internal coming to terms with herself and the world, as it is the external journey, but nothing is spoon-fed to the audience. The film is psychological and spiritual and the landscapes and the actions reflect the central character's shedding of burdens and confronting herself in a naked environment - it's universal, but profoundly personal. One reviewer described it as ""achingly beautiful"", having now seen ""Tracks"", I feel that's an apt description. I think director John Curran and everyone involved in making the film has pulled off an extremely challenging project and have created something of lasting value. Congratulations.",positive
Churchill,"On the basis that other reviewers have very adequately covered the glaring objections to this film I will keep this brief.In an action packed life of 80 years involving 2 world wars and one other significant war (The Boer War), a momentous political career, a life filled with both failure as well phenomenal achievements, that the filmmakers should think it necessary to MAKE UP a story about Churchill seems like the pinnacle of perversity. It just defies any logic hitherto known to mankind.""Poetic license"" is nothing new in movie making. However this movie is more like a ""license to kill"", kill a man's reputation, kill the concept of history, and kill the truth. The preservation of actual history in the light of revisionism is difficult enough without the general public being exposed to downright lies to further confuse and deceive them.I give this movie a 1 as a protest, in the probably forlorn hope that if enough people do the same to all movies that mess around with history, movie makers will get the message and steer their movies in a way that treats people and history responsibly.",negative
Churchill,"This film may make a good story but it doesn't make good history.It is true to say that the casualties on the first day in Normandy equalled those on the first day of the Battle of the Somme.However it is difficult to give much credence to the notion of the film.Churchill would have been aware of the threat posed by the V rockets and the prospect that if nothing were done eventually the whole of Europe would have been overrun by Stalin's Soviet army.Also by this time Churchill had very little say in things and he was aware of this.He was not senile,which the film implies,but he was haunted by depression,which the film chooses not to mention.All told this is a film which is totally unworthy of the great man's memory.",positive
Ayla: The Daughter of War,"Firstly, ""Oscar nominee of Turkey"" was a tag to attract Turkish audience. And i think it worked.Turkish soldiers who went on a mission for the Korean war were dramatic piece of history. None of us give enough credit for those spared for securing Turkey's position in modern Western World and NATO. But we know these soldiers proved both fearless and humanitarian during their duty. Was it a wise choice to send them and how it resulted? Here is not the place to answer. But we can say this movie was quite numb to the politics of 1950s and took just what it needed from those days.Based on a real story that we heard on TV before, scenario was the strong point of the movie. But instead of giving it the depth and character development it deserved, script plunged into silly sentimentality at all. Ismail Hacioglu, Ali Atay and even Cetin Tekindor failed to deliver something special from their selves. To make things worse like TV series seen on TRT TV like ""Diriliş: Ertugrul"" there were absurd and unrealistic fight scenes, Turkish Airlines and Hyundai ads. There was an irrelevant jump to the 1999 earthquake and scenario felt disconnected.Cinematography was not bad, there were beautiful shots and high quality. The real footage at the end was charming.Overall; another extravagant and shallow Turkish blockbuster film made a lot of fuss but nothing gained.",negative

The Birth of a Nation,"I typically love historical films. Having a bachelors degree in history and an enormous home library consisting of many historical books from all periods in American and World history, I have a fond knack for this particular subject.Unfortunately 2016's ""Birth of A Nation"" mostly disappoints. This film feels more like a made for TV movie than a big budget film. The dialogue felt contrived and the movie was plagued with too many clichés. The film also ignores the darker side of the slave rebellion, in which women and children became innocent victims, along with the plantation owners.Birth of a Nation basically paints Nat Turner has an unquestionable hero, yet the real Nat Turner - if you've ever read any history - probably wouldn't be considered as a hero by the vast majority of modern people, considering some of his questionable actions during the rebellion that left women and children slaughtered.There wasn't really much of an impact on me by the end of the film, and I think the film mostly fails to give the viewer a clear or unique message. In the end, the film mostly feels like a waste of resources. Historical films should be better than this!",negative
The Birth of a Nation,"Great film. Finally, a story of the slave who fought back. What is exceptionally great is that Nat Parker didn't tone down anything about the era or the obstacles thereof. American slavery was complex at best. Any type of slavery or oppression is complex. The characters were complex as was the main character. I quite enjoy Nat Parker and Armie Hammer on their own, but after this film - WOW. Powerful. It's not for the faint of heart or for those who want a ""washed out"" story. I've read a few of the comments here - and for those of you who understood context and the severity of the human condition for blacks during this time - it goes without saying that Nat Turner was well within his right to fight for his life (and therefore, the following paragraphs are not for you).For those of you who regard this film as ""propaganda"" or ""racist crap"", I am not surprised. Your real dismay is that the story is live for the entire world to see. Tough. If you push anyone too far - even a slave - then you get pushed back. Considering the treatment of blacks during that period, why would you dismiss his pain or that of any other ""slave""? Naysayers of this film are idiots and quite comical. I gather that you'd prefer it when the racist whites - of that era and this - had the upper hand and everyone else cowered. Tough. Naysayers aren't upset with the film - they are upset with the truth. To that I say lastly - tough.Continuous and unsuccessful attempts to dismiss this film helps it gain momentum. Thanks! America's past produced this story - the man - the legend. When I watch stories of the native Indians - I see pain and I understand the uprisings. When I watched Braveheart - I understood their pain and their uprising - and I'd assume, naysayers, that I wouldn't be able to find your ignorant comments under Braveheart.If you'd dare to call the main character a ""terrorist"" - please let me stop laughing first. Aw, poor bullies (naysayers). You're not happy unless you're the bully. Bullies get theirs in the end though. Whites slave-masters killed and abused WAY more slaves than blacks (and that was before, during and after Nat Turner's insurrection). But, you knew that naysayers. So you can attempt to twist history all day long - God knows the truth. That's enough for me. Conclusion: See the film if you can handle the truth. If you can't... well...

A United Kingdom,"I lived in Botswana for twenty-five odd years and enjoyed every single moment of it, almost certainly due in large measure to Seretse's enlightened politics and the genuine and natural warmth of the Botswana people. I knew both main characters quite well. Seretse was a very approachable man, even as president, and it was a pleasure to spend some time in his company. He was a man well loved by everyone, black and white. In fact, in Botswana one scarcely thought in those terms. As a politician he had huge charisma and was a great orator. He was also a born leader. I remember well being told by insiders that government Ministers who were in trouble for minor abuse of office or the like, would tremble in fear outside his office when they were to be 'carpeted'.Ruth was an extraordinarily capable woman and even in her later years had more stamina than almost anyone I have known. She was at work in her office in Gaborone from early morning to the end of the day, patron of the Red Cross, Botswana Council of Women etc etc. Contrary, however, to one reviewer's criticism, Rosalind Pike's portrayal was quite accurate. She was not a strident campaigner but a very effective mover who enjoyed a social life and had many friends. In her widowhood she received constant visits from senior members of the tribe and government and was widely loved and respected by her people. She was most certainly ""Mohumagadi"" - Mother of the Nation.This film portrays their personalities pretty accurately and the characterisation of the actors is extraordinarily true to life. Both David Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike were absolutely convincing. The quality of the acting very quickly overcame my initial niggling concern that the physical likenesses were not quite there. The photography of Botswana was outstanding and the familiar views of Serowe from the Palapye 'road' and the scenes in the kgotla were quite emotional for me; I unexpectedly found I had a lump in my throat.I can understand that, for others, the film may not have the immediacy it has for me, perhaps, but previous criticisms of 'cold' and 'unemotional' - No! Leaving aside my personal interest, it deserved to be the opener for the London Film Festival. Maybe not a total ""blockbuster"" but an unusual and great film nonetheless. Very close to fact.",positive

And after watching this today, I can bet you a 1000 bucks, that 10 mins in and you'll even forget RK is in there.If there's anyone who can play Sanjay dutt better than sanjay dutt, is Ranbir Kapoor, and i'm not even exaggerating. Kapoor portrayed many aspects of Sanjay's life, in such a beautiful way, that it actually feels like watching 6 different movies in a go. 
The father-son bond, is the pillar this film stands on, and i'm pretty sure every son out there, is gonna connect with this at some level and shed some tears. Paresh Rawal, did more than justice to the role of a great and noble man, Mr. Sunil Dutt.The sheer amount of dedication that went into making this excellence, is hard to neglect. Everything, from direction to camerawork reflects the zealousness and precision of what Hirani stands for.It took more than 3 years for all this to cook up, given that, a typical Bollywood film wraps up in a mere 3 months (keeping in mind the example of Race 3, 80 days in the shooting, and we all know how it turned out), one can only admire Rajkumar Hirani's endearment towards film making. As far as Bollywood goes, it's all commercialised nowadays, films are made just in the essence of making money, but, it gives me hope, when I know, there's a person out there like Rajkumar, whose work over the years proves that in this herd of money grabbers, he cares. Cares enough, to dedicate his life and time into making something extraordinary each and every juncture.
And Sanju is no different, it's the perfect example of a Raju film, a collab of drama, emotions, laughter, stirred with philosophy and full of Life. 
And for all those haters out there, I know you're reading this (with a grim face), and cursing around, however - 'Kuch Toh Log Kahenge'",positive
Heaven Is for Real,"I went to see this movie with great anticipation after reading the very well written book by Pastor Todd Burpo a couple of years ago. In fact, I went to see it the very first weekend it was in the cinema. However, after having read ""The Client"" many, many years ago and then seeing the movie on the silver screen, I was very disappointed with what Hollywood can do to a book when they try to turn it into a movie, so I had a bit of apprehension, too, when ""Heaven is for Real"" started playing. About halfway through the movie, I wanted to get up and leave. The screenwriters left about 75% of the book out of the film entirely. The film wasn't centered around Colton Burpo and his incredible glimpse of Heaven, but rather it was largely about his father, Todd, and the struggles he encountered in dealing with young Coltons' revelations. Even the way Colton initially divulged his experience to his parents was different from the book. It seemed to me that the screenwriters wanted to dramatize the movie and create some suspense where there shouldn't have been any in the depicted struggles between Todd and his wife. Do yourself a favor and read the book instead. You will be sadly disappointed with the film if you've read the book beforehand.",negative
Heaven Is for Real,"I hate the way people pull apart movies trying to determine an underlying message that is being given to us. Why can't you just accept a movie for what it is, why do you have to pick it apart. Not every person who rates this as great is religious but a lot of you are branding this movie as a bible beating religious crowds movie when that is not so. I loved this movie because i think it speaks to each and every one of us, to me it gives me hope that there is something wonderful out there besides the chaos of the world we live in, where all people do is fight, and cheat and lie and hate, where we steal from one another, kill one another etc. If this brings hope, if some people believe that this is real then let them do so. If you choose not to like it or believe then don't. As a species we should all be living our lives better than what we do, we take everything for granted and we have become greedy and self absorbed, everything is about what you can get for yourself. And as for the person who said every experience like what the kid had has always been linked to flat lining, then your wrong, thats not always the case.",positive
The Fifth Estate,"THE FIFTH ESTATE is based on two books, both written by people who had personal and legal disputes with WikiLeaks.These are personally biased sources and are now outdated by three years. They tell only one side of the story.These authors had an interest in portraying Julian Assange as dishonest or manipulative for competitive, personal and legal reasons.It is hard to imagine how a film which aims to dramatize only their version of events could genuinely aspire to being fair or accurate.The film does not tell the story Julian Assange or WikiLeaks staff such as Sarah Harrison, Joseph Farrell or Kristinn Hrafnsson would tell. Hopefully, soon, their story too can be told.",negative
The Fifth Estate,"I truly went to the theater expecting a quality film but was less than satisfied. Complex scenes. Many difficult exchanges of dialog and an ever so frustrating case of a multitude of much too quick flashes of computer crap. Stick to the true story would help. The confusion was so common that I looked at my wife wishing we had a ""DVR"" so as to rewind to repeat the scenes. I came to the end of the film just as confused with any sense of appreciation of what I just sat through. There way too many loose ends and questions that left me in deep irritation with the conclusion. I can not recommend this movie. I did come away with a somewhat bit of praise for the lead actors and their attempt to make the best of a lacking film filled with flaws. I sadly can not endorse the film for it's many flaws.",positive
Devil's Knot,"First off, I never gave much thought to the controversy surrounding the West Memphis Three. I was always around bands who protested their sentencing and read about the objections to their trials, but never gave it any more thought than that. I never watched or reviewed any of the ""Paradise Lost"" documentaries so I didn't feel like I had the right to take a side on the subject. All I knew was three little boys were murdered and it was a horrible tragedy.In 1993, three young boys go into the woods of a small town in West Memphis, Arkansas. After their bodies are found in the river, the entire region is turned upside down as the murderer is tracked down. Three teenage locals accused of being Satanists are suspects in the killings. Have the authorities found the killers or is there more to the story that we've never heard?When I saw a movie was being made based on the murders at Robin Hood Hill in West Memphis, Arkansas, I didn't even entertain seeing it. Not that I'm an unfeeling human being. I just try to put my focus on certain types of films and stick within those parameters because of time constraints. My mind was changed when I found out Scott Derrickson co- wrote and executive produced ""Devil's Knot.""Scott Derrickson is a Hollywood director who shares many of the same Christian beliefs I do. It just so happens he wrote and directed what is in my opinion one of the finest examples of a supernatural horror film in 2013 - ""Sinister."" He also directed ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose,"" ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" remake, ""Hellraiser: Inferno,"" and the upcoming ""Deliver Us from Evil."" Recently, Derrickson announced he's attached to helm the upcoming ""Doctor Strange"" movie for Marvel and Disney. Needless to say, I have a deep respect for his work and anything he puts his name on.Director Atom Egoyan's ""Devil's Knot"" isn't meant to break any new ground in the investigations of the West Memphis killings. I see it as a tool to expose and tell the story to new people who might not be interested in watching documentaries or reading pages of case studies. It's an easy way to get people educated about one of the most infamous murder trials in American history.""Devil's Knot"" encouraged me to do some research on the killings. As soon as the credits rolled on screen, I hit the internet and compared what I'd seen to the actual evidence and professional conjecture I found. It's safe to say Egoyan's movie doesn't embellish much and sticks to the facts.I was very impressed by the cast assembled for the indie film. ""Devil's Knot"" boasts Oscar winners Reese Witherspoon and Colin Firth as the two lead characters. Supporting actors include Stephen Moyer, Bruce Greenwood, Elias Koteas, and Alessandro Nivola. It's obvious they all took the movie seriously and put their heart and souls into their performance.""Devil's Knot"" was never rated for the U.S. and contains disturbing images, language, and nudity. The crime scene photographs and sequences were enough to make me cringe and look away at points and I'm a horror film fanatic. It's just something about knowing this was based on true events that made me uneasy watching those scenes. The only nudity is of the bodies of the three murder victims. Trust me, there's nothing gratifying or attractive in what we are shown. It's purely used to display the severity of the perverse and sick nature of the crimes.If you're uneducated on the events surrounding the murders at Robin Hood Hill in West Memphis, Arkansas, I highly recommend you seeing ""Devil's Knot."" If you've seen all the ""Paradise Lost"" documentaries, chances are you'll feel like you're seeing a basic retread of the information already shared in those films. According to my research, it seems to be the perfect opportunity to get educated about the tragic murders and the three boys accused of the crimes.",negative
Devil's Knot,"In 1996, HBO produced a documentary, ""Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills"", about the much-publicized murder case of three pre-teen boys, Stevie Branch, Michael Moore, and Christopher Byers, who were murdered in the wooded creeks called Robin Hood Hills near West Memphis, Arkansas. The local authorities were convinced the murders were enacted by three older male teens, Damien Echols, Jessie Misskelley, Jr., and Jason Baldwin. According to the present film and the HBO documentaries, the local authorities targeted the older teens as suspects in a kind of modern-day witch-hunt because of their interest in the occult, horror films, and Heavy Metal music. Echols was often seen wearing black clothing, an affront to the predominant Christian community of West Memphis. He later admitted to reading about Aleister Crowley but asserted he had never read any of Crowley's actual writings.The case against the three teens hinged primarily on the notion that the murders were committed as a kind of sacrifice in a satanic ritual. Also, dubious testimony, particularly that of Vicki Hutcheson and her son Aaron, was later recanted. Hutcheson claimed initially that she had seen the three teens involved in Satanic rituals and that Damien Eckles had bragged about committing the murders at the event. She later said she had been coerced by police to offer false evidence, fearing authorities might take away her son. Her son Aaron in a video-taped interview said he had seen the actual murders, but then later when he was older withdrew his testimony claiming he knew nothing about the crimes. Other evidence, such as the possible involvement of an African-American who ended up in the ladies' room and smeared blood on the walls at Bojangles Restaurant the night of the murders was never adequately followed up on. No actual physical evidence linked the boys with the murders. Their prosecution was mainly based on circumstantial evidence concerning their interest in the occult.Twenty years after the convictions of the so-called ""West Memphis Three"" and 17 years after the HBO Documentary ""Paradise Lost"", the film ""the Devil's Knot"" based on the book of the same name was released, starring Colin Firth as Ron Lax, a private investigator who became interested in the case, and Reese Witherspoon as Pamela Hobbs, the mother of victim Stevie Branch. First off, the film is beautifully shot. The lush swampy areas portraying the Robin Hood Hills appear almost like photos you might see in a postcard. The night shots are particularly beautiful, although simultaneously horrific as the setting for the brutal murders.Critics claimed the film didn't add anything new to the understanding of the case, but I don't believe this was the filmmakers' intentions. The point of the film I believe was simply to tell the story in a dramatic/narrative format rather than a documentary. (HBO produced three documentaries in all about the case and probably assisted in the revelation about the poor police investigation, the witch-hunt sensibilities towards members of their community interested in the occult, and the dubious testimonies which led eventually to the release of the West Memphis Three.) Apart from whether or not audiences will believe the West Memphis Three are guilty or innocent, much of the film is about the complexity of such cases. Unless a defendant truthfully confesses to a crime, many questions and strange circumstances surround most cases. In many instances, the whole truth may be nearly unobtainable, such as questions which still surround the JFK Assassination.An excellent and underrated film. The main reasons ""The Devil's Knot"" works as well as it does is because of the fine acting, particularly Witherspoon, Firth, and an honorable mention to James Hamrick as Damien Echols, the wonderful direction, and also because of the film's point of view. The film shows both sides of the case. The local authorities were pressured by the community to find the three teens guilty since a rift between conservative Christians and those interested in the occult was growing wider. In the film, one character states that those interested in the occult were bound to become enmeshed in a crime case sooner or later. Of course, the most informative details can be found in the three HBO documentaries, ""Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills"" (1996), ""Paradise Lost 2: Revelations"" (2000), and ""Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory"" (2011).",positive
Race,"They say those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. I guess this motto is the reason Hollywood continues to make historical figure movies at least once a year. This weekend, the life of track legend Jesse Owens comes to the silver screen in the movie entitled Race. While the Oscars may eat up these kinds of movies, they sometimes get overcredited with being the best movie over the year. So once more I dive into my local theater to review the latest in cinematic productions. Let's get to it then. When it comes to historical biographies such as Race, you look for a portrayal that elicits pride, passion, and other emotions that will inspire the audience. And once more Hollywood manages to bring all of that to bear with cinematic magic. Race is packed with well edited sequences that show the struggles Owens faced in his day as he trained to become the champion. The racial fervor of the times is brought in full force with extras intensely screaming with furious scowls painting their faces. Captains and financers of the Nazi regime are even more chilling, as they radiated the menacing energy we've come to know from history, adding suspense to the film. The emotion it brings will truly unnerve some people, and I'm sure some group will get offended by the portrayal of some Race in this movie (despite the inspirational theme in this movie).But the negativity is only one side of the coin, and Race does an even better job with their more lighthearted moments. The training sessions are just the ice breaker to preaching the morals of hard work and determination. Once at the meets, things get turned up a notch with blaring music and beautiful shots raise your emotions to new heights. With each shot of the gun, each stride across the track, I felt roped into Owens world. And the finale well lets just say the morals they preach would be grand for today's society could stand to learn from. Of course being based on actual events, this suspense can be missing if you know Owens accomplishments already, which is unfortunate in these types of movies. Yet even the best editor can only do so much and we switch our focus to the actors now. Stephan James gets two thumbs up from this reviewer for his portrayal of Owens. He was able to capture the work ethic of Jesse, delivering powerful lines to motivate the audience, but not to cross the line into cheesiness and overdramatic presentation. In addition he adds a nice comedic edge that balances his character out into a new light. Jason Sudeikis also did his role justice playing Larry Snyder, the coach of our Olympian. Rarely do you see Sudeikis in a serious role, so it was refreshing to see him tackle this part. He has emotional fervor, bringing fire to the screen as he defends his morals and encourages his athletes to give it his all. Sure the screaming rants were a little over done, but all in all it worked for me. However, don't think his comedy has been drained away, Sudeikis still brings his comedic timing to the picnic and reigned his ridiculousness in for this film. These two have great chemistry and together really sold the story. Yet with all the good I've mentioned, we should probably talk about some of the limitations to this film. The first is of course the predictability of this story. YES I know when it comes to historical biographies you have only so much to work with, but it still slightly takes away from the suspense and mystery. A second limitation was the lack of seeing his relationship with his teammates that could have led to some interesting substories and character building. Yes we did see some of this near the end, and it was probably more important to portray the pressure placed on his shoulders, but still I would have liked to see a little more. As such there were a few moments that could have been left out of the movie to either make the run time shorter or make room for some other plot lines. Outside of that though, it is quite a fun and entertaining film. Overall, Race does it job to illustrate the past and inspire you to accomplish your dreams. The phenomenal editing and great casting truly preach the morals and lessons that history has to offer us. Yet it is a simplistic movie that lacks a lot of special effects are uniqueness to require a theater visit. As for the accuracy of this film, I can't say as I need to revisit his biography at some point. Historical fanatics are going to enjoy this the most, but those who appreciate good acting should check this one out. My one hope is that this movie doesn't add further fuel to the fire and cause another fight on social media or some other avenue. My scores for this film are:Biography/Drama/Sport: 7.5-.8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0",negative
Race,"Rewriting historical facts and twisting them for leftist propaganda purposes, this biased crap would make Jesse Owens rolling in his grave, as he was better treated in Nazi Germany than in the US. Adolf Hitler treated Jesse Owens better than his own President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) and that shameful fact is one that CANNOT change no matter how many money are invested into brainwashing people with shitty movies like this and will always be there to haunt the US and leftists worldwide.",positive
The Railway Man,Moving drama based on the WWII experiences of Eric Lomax a Prisoner of War forced to work on a railway in Burma following the fall of Singapore to the Japanese.Lomax is played in two time-lines by Jeremy Irvine in the war and Colin Firth in his older years.He and his colleagues endure severe torture at the hands of their Japanese soldier captors forcing severe post traumatic stress disorder long after the war has ended.Lomax is a railway geek hence the title of the film. His demons come back to haunt him once he finds love with Patti (a rather boring Nicole Kidman) and the identity of one of his torturers is revealed as still being alive by wartime friend Finlay (Swedish Stellan Skarsgard). After travelling back to the site of his capture he finds forgiveness to the Japanese 'translator' soldier.The story is very interesting and emotional but the trouble with Colin Firth films I find is he plays pretty much the same character in all of them. A broody stiff upper lip Englishman. The film has a documentary feel like an episode of Michael Portillos Railway Journeys but on the whole provides a worthy film to watch.,negative
The Railway Man,"I read the short storyline of the film before viewing and it had intrigued me. I came into it with an open mind - at first romance and then the inescapable drama. The acting by Firth was amazing. I was mesmerized. It may be slow (to some of a lesser attention span) at first, but eased into a psychological drama that holds on tight and will not release until the finale. Spectacular cinematography, the scenes are beautiful and real. It is a wake up call to those who have not/do not understand the great span of WWII - brings much needed insight into the history of this particular banker's war. Ultimately, this film beautifully portrays the ultimate power of forgiveness. Which brought tears to my eyes, in the panic and hysteria that the world now feels due to war and terror, it is good to know that there is some shred of humanity that exists and has hope to exist in the future.",positive
Super 30,"I am writing this review again.
More than ten times my reviews (which got more than 500 likes) got deleted cos the fellas associated with this lousy film cannot respect opinions.
The lead actor is famous as a narcissist in real life. He shamelessly endorsed fairness creams. No.wonder he is aft my review.Coming back to the film, this film is loaded with melodrama n cliches. The acting n direction is abysmal. The lead actor did not even come close in resembling the real life guy.
The film's screenplay n editing is an incoherent mess. When you're making a biopic, you have to respect what actually happened. The real life person is accused of deceit, fraud n fined for not appearing in a courtroom. Basically this film has scrubbed away aspects of the real person's life.
Too much melodrama, too much fake n laughable stuff.",negative
Super 30,"The movie is gripping and absolutely scintillating. Not the typical Bollywood masala film though. The film makes you cry, laugh, feel delighted and helpless at the state of affairs in our society. The direction is great and except for 15-20 minutes in the second half, where the film is a bit slow, there is never a dull moment.Casting is fantastic as it is and Hrithik Roshan has once again proven that he is arguably the best actor among all the superstars of Bollywood. Pankaj Tripathi has again delivered a great performance in his limited role.All in all a must watch movie. After all it is rare to see a superstar delivering a content driven film.",positive
Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House,"From the very beginning, in order to understand everything, you do have to pay close attention to each scene and dialogue. While the cutting in most areas of the movie is very precise and fine for the tone, there were a couple bits that seemed an odd transition. I found the story shown quite intriguing, though I have not looked in detail in the real-life story. The conclusion felt a bit anti-climatic, but it is an okay ending.I would consider this movie watchable if you enjoy a tense and a semi-complicated plot structure for a movie. I would even say it can be re-watched occasionally, though there is little humour displayed.",negative
Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House,"Mark Felt (Liam Neeson) is the Associate Director of the FBI as the right-hand man of the legendary Hoover. He's considered the G-Men's G-Man. After Hoover's death, L. Patrick Gray is appointed the acting director over Felt despite his loyal 30 years career. His wife Audrey (Diane Lane) suggests resigning. They are still struggling with their estranged daughter Joan who had run away a year earlier. It's 1972 and there's a break-in at the Watergate. Felt is ordered to limit his investigation and he would become the infamous whistle blower Deep Throat.This could work as a companion piece to All The President's Men. Oddly enough, both extreme sides of the political spectrum would consider Felt a villain. One would consider him a traitor. The other would consider him a jackbooted militaristic police. Neither would find this movie fair and balanced. On the other hand, some today would find this very fitting. Neeson is a perfect sincere self-righteous FBI agent. This is one version of the man and allows a bit of insight. That is more than enough.",positive
Pele: Birth of a Legend,"I want to state first that I do really like Pélé, he is one of the best athletes in history, not only in his athletic performance but also in his conduct outside the pitch.His compelling personality is well displayed and I cannot speak with certainty about his background, but I suspect that while it was challenging it was perhaps not quite as bad as it is displayed at times.My main problem with the movie is the display of the national teams aside from the brazilians. It was at this time and unlike the depiction of the movie well known that Brazil was a good team, perhaps not the favorites to win, but by no means a complete underdog. The favorites to win were West Germany, France and the Soviet Union. Sweden who is antagonisticly depicted was a nation with many players at the very end of their career and though the population was excited at their nations participation and that for the first time (for the swedes) professional players playing in clubs abroad would be permitted to play for the national team. So people were hopeful that with homefield advantage and the addition of a handful of worldclass professionals though perhaps past their prime(Niels Liedholm 36 at the time and Gunnar Gren 38) that maybe possibly Sweden could win.So the primary factual error here is that Brazil was by no means colossal underdogs and the Swedes were not as massively favored as depicted and certainly not as arrogant and demeaning as they are shown. Though there is some truth in their strategy in the final game, the swedes did hope to try and score an early goal hoping the brazilians would be unable to recover.(According to Niels Liedholm).I also find it unfortunate that while racism is horrible and was certainly present even amongst my own swedish ancestors. It is very unfortunate that this media never depicted some of the really inspiring moments of people in this tournament. Because in the end Pélé have stated that the swedish king at the time went down to meet the players on both sides and shook everybodys hand and chatted with them regardless of what they looked like. For many people just like the king football have no color and whilst Péle has had to deal with his fair share of racism he has seldom dwelt on the negative, but almost always uplifted the positive.For my parents who vividly remember this tournament and who have always held Pélé in very high regard as both a footballer and a person. It was rather difficult to swallow the depiction of his opponents(our national team in particular) and that of the tournament as a whole which is perhaps one of the most memorable world cups in history with Pélé the 17-year old wunderkind and Just Fontaine who set a record of scoring goals that to this day stands.",negative
Pele: Birth of a Legend,"I was invited to the world premier of this film at the TriBeCa Film Festival, in New York. I say invited, as if my life is some sort of glamorous affair. In reality, a mate at work couldn't make it, and he knew I'd have no actual plans, so I eagerly obliged.Just before the movie started, the 350 or so people in the audience got what they wanted, as the man himself stood up and raised his hand to the instagram happy crowd. Just knowing Pele was in the audience gave the room a little extra energy.Perhaps a little naive, I knew a little about Pele's playing career but little of the man and, the journey to what he became. The film follows his early years with friends at home, up until he becomes 17 and plays for Brazil in the 1958 World Cup in Sweden. There's enough humour, big laughs, drama, and passion in the film that will translate to fans familiar with the legend and those who may have only heard of him.The real treat, were the applause, and cheering from the audience when the on-screen Pele scored. His hand went up in recognition and the cheers got louder. I was pleased that despite the film keeping my attention he may have nodded off, he's knocking on a bit.I waited outside afterward and managed to get a signed Santos shirt from him, which kinda gave me goose pimples, and rammed home the magnitude of who this man was, and what he had done for the game. My dad would have been proud. Sadly the shirt is the guys from work, so I'm currently deciding whether to buy a replica shirt and say I didn't get it, or beginning to practice the man's signature!

Christine,"Christine (2016/I) was directed by Antonio Campos. Rebecca Hall plays Christine Chubbuck, a TV reporter in Sarasota, Florida. This is a fictionalized biography of Ms. Chubbuck. If you check Wikipedia, you'll know that much of what we see actually happened.Christine Chubbuck was a person with depression, or possibly bipolar illness. She was well educated and financially comfortable, but her interpersonal life was in shambles. In the film, her behavior was strange and sometimes bizarre. People keep asking her, ""Are you OK?"" She always assures them that she's OK, and they believe her. Even if they don't fully believe her, they have their own problems, and they move on to other matters.Rebecca Hall is an excellent actor. She resembles Christine Chubbuck physically. (That's probably one of the reasons she got the part.) She makes us believe in Christine and her problems, which is no easy task. (People who don't have mental illness find it hard to fake.) This is a difficult movie to watch, but I felt that the acting was strong, and the message was important. I wish the producers had rolled a statement before the credits saying, ""If you, or someone you know, feels and acts like Christine, call this hotline.""We saw the movie at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester NY. It will work very well on the small screen.",negative
Christine,"Most people who have ever heard of Christine Chubbuck already know how her story ends; She's been attributed to glimpsing into the future of television journalism with her final statement, the story turning into a morbid urban legend in the over forty years since the incident occurred. I admit, the first time I heard the story almost ten years ago, it sounded so bizarre, I almost couldn't believe it.Christine sets out to humanize Christine Chubbuck, and elicit empathy from an audience that might already see her as someone who is monstrous. Yet, somehow, the movie accomplishes it's goal, giving her humanity that was lost in the headlines. Much of that credit is due to Rebecca Hall who transformed herself completely, throwing herself into the role so thoroughly that it's almost frightening.The first time we see Christine she is filming herself doing a mock interview, and then later on, we see Christine examining every little gesture, picking herself apart in order to remake herself into something better to gain that elusive feeling of perfection, yet no matter how many times she's assured by Jean Reed (Maria Dizzia), the only person at WZRB that could probably be considered a friend, there's still that look of dissatisfaction with herself etched on her face.It's been written that Christine Chubbuck used to give puppet shows to mentally challenged children so the screenwriter incorporated that into the film, but it's utilized as little glimpses of what she's thinking: 'Be Bold, Be Brave' she tells them, a fairly innocuous phrase, but for the viewer who knows what's to come later on, it has chilling connotations.The moment that made Christine Chubbuck famous is shown in all of it's brutal and devastating impact. The film even shows her mother watching as it all unfolds. I don't know if Christine Chubbuck's mother, Peg, was actually watching the day Christine did what she did, but the possibility of that actually occurring, is heartbreaking.It's a testament to the filmmakers that, though Christine can often come across as incredibly difficult and unlikable, the audience still has a great deal of empathy for her. Yes, she has fights with her boss about 'blood and guts' television, and her mother about the state of her life, but it's carefully contrasted with moments of quiet desperation, like the sequence when the head news anchor, George (Michael C. Hall), takes her to a transactional analysis meeting where they play a game of 'Yes, but"" and Christine slowly reveals the things that she feels make her life impossible to live.Overall, Christine is a portrait of a woman desperately trying to make something of herself but because of a chemical imbalance, she can't seem to sync with the people and world around her. Anchored by Rebecca Hall who gives an Oscar-worthy turn, Christine is also supported by an excellent supporting cast (Maria Dizzia and J. Smith Cameron in particular), strong direction and an incisive script. Highly recommended.",positive
The Lady in the Van,"Dame Maggie Smith and Alec Jennings are perfectly cast and directed in this amusing, moving portrayal of an irascible old lady's relationship with the timid writer who kindly offered her temporary refuge in his drive - but where she stayed for 15 years. It is a breathtakingly stunning performance from Smith and a brilliant performance by Jennings. The script is warm, insightful and witty, with the clever device of having two Alans - the writer who observes and the man who lives and interacts with the world outside. All the supporting cast are wonderful too. It's a must see movie, particularly for anyone who has cared for an elderly parent, or watched a parent care for their grandparent. Funny, moving and brilliant, it is a joy.",negative
The Lady in the Van,"The most notable features of Alan Bennett's writing are his honesty and wry, gentle humour. Despite some plot embellishments the authenticity of his ambivalence towards his mother and Miss Shepherd and the mixture of guilt, exasperation and pity which governed his relationships with these very different women, is beautifully conveyed. Maggie Smith's brilliance lies in her ability to suggest the mental illness which destroyed Margaret/Mary's life and still clouds her mind combined with her shrewd determination to survive while retaining some shreds of dignity and independence. She senses Alan's inability to turn her away and he, in turn, seems to recognise a sensitive, traumatised soul in the stinking, obstinate vagrant. Alex Jennings captures the essence of Alan Bennett, his fastidiousness, his high moral standards and his relentless pursuit of truth in his writing. The superb script and talented cast give a vivid portrayal of this period of the writer's life and the charm of his Camden neighborhood.",positive

All movies, whether artistic or commercial, should be viewed as an independent work. I have not read the book but I am sure it was an extraordinary story and to bring it to screen would be a challenge. I am glad the director did it skilfully, not focusing on the abuse of the victim but on her thoughts and feelings. The perpetrator has tried various means to make her give up the hope on freedom, but the human spirit just cannot be kept captive. As humans, we all long for freedom, this is engraved into the deepest part of our soul and nothing can change that, that is why we write books, poems ,composed symphonies ,build monuments and even free a nation. Some shots of the movie let the audience perceive the world through the victim's eyes, and even her thoughts and dreams, you can clearly see although there is so little that she can see, all these glimpse of the world have gradually built up her inner strength. The drastic weight loss of the actress adds a level of realism for the movie and her nakedness make a lot of audience quiver in fear to imagine how much abuse she has taken.",positive
Philomena,"As several critics have observed, this wonderful film, just shown at TIFF, is destined to become this year's King's Speech (which began its Oscar run in Toronto too, though Philomena has already picked up accolades in Venice). Both British films have strongly emotional undercurrents leavened by wry humour, feature outstanding performances from the leads and are based on true stories.Judi Dench, as the Irish woman whose out-of-wedlock son is taken from her by Catholic nuns and sold to a rich American couple in the 1950's, has never been better. She imbues the role with a mix of wisdom (after all, as she reminds us repeatedly, she was nurse for 30 years) and naiveté that would seem to be impossible were it not so deftly handled. While the cynical atheist portrayed by Steve Coogan rarely misses an opportunity to poke fun at her, more often than not she enjoys the last laugh.Despite the consummate acting, and Frears' slick directing, the greatest treat of the film is Steve Coogan's screenplay. Given its subject matter, the story could easily have veered into melodrama, but just when it is on the verge of doing so Coogan pulls us back from the edge. Thankfully, Coogan himself is there to convey precisely the proper blend of sarcasm and compassion.",negative
Philomena,"My wife talked me into going, I wanted to see Captain Philips but she was adamant this time. We both grew up in Ireland and I didn't want to see another one of those movies focused on stereotypes, the marketing blob types like the Quiet Man and Ryan's Daughter...stereotypical nonsense that lampoon our history and our culture. Steve Coogan and Judy Dench, especially Judy got it just right from the very start. They were smart, witty, serious and most of all, Judy was 'Irish' They really got the spirit of an Irish mom, that cocktail of guilt, generosity, inferiority and a heart to care for the entire world spot on. Dench in the hotel thanking everybody for being 'so nice' and getting who her son was as a child as others were today trying to 'break the news' to her...she wasn't just a step ahead, she was years ahead. Really excellent, really well done. Beautiful!",positive
The 33,"I really tried to like this but it was a hopeless battle. Poor effects, strange casting and a very long, dull, monotonous script made this more of a chore than a pleasure. I quite enjoyed Everest recently and was hoping this would be of the same. Sadly this was a long drawn out mess. The subject matter while interesting and dramatic was not utilised and you felt nothing for the miners. Although you know before hand that there were no fatalities among the group the writers do nothing to push you into thinking they were in mortal danger. When the end finally came there was no sense of relief of feeling of jubilation the movie just fell flat. If you're expecting something good here move along mediocre at best",negative
The 33,"With its empowering story, visuals and acting, this film brings another true survival story to life. A group of thirty three gold miners go to work in the underlying mountains of Chile when their lives quickly turn upside down. Stranded by the collapse of the rocks, the men are forced to work together, struggle for food, stay optimistic despite their life threatening condition. With every second so crucial, the intensity of the film leaves the audience on the edge of their seats.Watching this film made me feel the pain of the miners, the anxiety of the families and the stress of the rescue team. I could personally feel the struggle from every side of the story. This is an amazing aspect of the film, especially because it is based on a true story. What better way to gain awareness than to make individuals feel the experience for themselves. I felt like throwing up throughout the whole movie and that just shows how amazingly the filmmakers depicted this horrifyingly true story of the innocent men who were stranded and their struggle to survive. The filmmakers have created a film that makes the audience feel as though they are experiencing the struggle rather than just watching it. I felt as if I was starving and becoming dehydrated just by watching. It's what makes the movie feel so real. The persuasive acting contributes to the empowering movie, especially Antonio Banderas whose performance as the leader, Mario was so believable. It's a role completely different from what he usually plays and he made me believe he was a Chilean miner. Usually films based on tragic events feel depressing but this film feels empowering and comedic in certain scenes. I enjoyed that. The film didn't make the best impression at first but, it became very engaging and strong towards the end. I give a lot of credit to its great ending because, in my opinion, an ending can really make or break a movie. I give the movie four out of five stars and recommend it for people between the ages of 13 and 18. Adults will enjoy it as well. Reviewed by Harmony M., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, age 16",positive
Testament of Youth,"I desperately wanted to see this film, since I love all the actors and find Vera Brittain's story so incredible and heartfelt, regardless of the fact that it would have been similar to many stories after the war. This really is a story about love, friendship and loss. The fact that it was based on someone's memoir made it all that more real and devastating, considering that could happen to anyone( if a new war was to begin) and has and is, in certain parts of the world, happening to someone right now.They haven't sugar coated anything in this film, and even though I've gone from being cheerful to completely distraught, I wouldn't change anything about it.If you want to watch a film that is real, explicit in the right way, but without gore or an irrational amount of romance, and with the perfect cast and acting, that has beautifully reflected this brave woman's story...................... Look no further!",negative
Testament of Youth,"I first read ""Testament of Youth"" during university and was captivated by the emotionally moving real-life story of love and loss during war. The memoir spurred me on to read more about Vera Brittain, particularly during the World War I period that is the setting of ""Testament of Youth."" Having read her diary ""Chronicle of Youth"" and ""Letters from a Lost Generation"" long before watching this film, I had formed a strong attachment to Vera Brittain almost as if she was a personal friend. Reading her words, it is very easy for anyone, particularly a young, studious person to relate to her and the blossoming romance she describes between herself and her first love, Roland Leighton. As such, I had extremely high expectations for this film, and was skeptical that Alicia Vikander and Kit Harington would be ""my"" Vera and Roland--I had such a fixed idea of them in my head. Fortunately Alicia and Kit's performances met my expectations. They had wonderful chemistry and the relationship as portrayed captured the essence of Vera and Roland: the intelligent, witty banter, sweet/innocent flirtatiousness, passion and angst. This relationship is at the heart of the memoir and is the driving force for much of what occurs during and after its commencement, so it was very important for this relationship to be portrayed accurately and to be emotionally moving for the audience, which it certainly was for me. Supporting characters played by Taron Egerton (Edward) and Colin Morgan (Victor) were also wonderfully portrayed, which was a relief as the relationships with her brother and friend are extremely important in the memoir as well, and just as emotionally moving as the romance between Vera and Roland. As far as the other aspects of the film are concerned, the stirring scenes at the hospital where Vera volunteers as a nurse are gripping and faithfully portray the tumultuous wartime experiences that Vera describes in her memoir.The highlight for me was the poetry of Roland which is interwoven during key moments in the film. This is a lovely element to the story that I found very touching and it provides a beautiful, emotional backdrop for key scenes. I really hope this film spurs those who haven't read the memoir/have never heard of Vera Brittain to go on and read ""Testament of Youth."" The book certainly lingered in my mind for quite some time after I had first read it, and the film likewise recaptured those feelings for me.",positive
Ip Man 3,"Like other Chinese movies, you see the beginning and know the ending. A hero representing the Chinese martial arts have to fight against other fighters and he always wins (like a superman).I expected a better movie but I was aware that I had wasted my time to come to theatre to see it. It seems that the director never wants to change their mind to bring this kind of movie goes out of Asia. The main character faces to fighters from low level to high level (level 1 - 2 - 3 - 5). The way he lives looks like the way of a perfect person that no one else could be better! And that's all about kung fu Chinese movies of all time.Not sure how this movie could come up to 8.0 (1k reviews) but I guess that 1k Chinese users tried to vote it up :)",negative
Ip Man 3,"I will try to keep this spoiler free. Donnie Yen returns for Ip Man 3, and despite being produced by the same team, the theme that is explored... is that much deeper. Ip Man focuses on ""Survival"", Ip Man 2 focuses on Everyday Life and Making a Living, while Ip Man 3 focuses on ""Life"" itself.The audience will need to pay attention to details to enjoy the movie fully, starting from the first scene, and really understand how the first scene relates to the whole story. So... REMEMBER the first scene! (The Butterfly Scene)There are subtle hints hidden in the move, be it Bruce Lee's quote of ""Be Like Water"" or ""One-Inch Punch"" where viewers really need to pay attention to the story and choreography to understand.Ip Man 1 and 2 focuses on grounded action, and realistic choreography. Ip Man 3 has that, but added another layer of beauty to the movie, thanks to Yuen Woo Ping(Matrix, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon)'s choreography. The details of every fight scene can be enjoyed and explored. While many think that Ip Man 3 will be just a martial arts exhibition, but the team managed to bring in a layer of emotion we have not seen in 1 and 2. Donnie's Ip Man is now a much more grounded, humble and just that neighborhood family guy we all love. Donnie Yen's performance here is nothing sort of amazing.Lynn Hung's performance is also outstanding.All in all, the movie may not please all critics and fans who ONLY loves hard-hitting action, but if you are looking at an Ip Man movie with Great action, great humour and that sense of touch with a love story, then Ip Man 3 is the best in the series.",positive
Borg vs. McEnroe,"In full disclosure, I am a tennis player and as a boy I idolized McEnroe. I admired Borg a great deal as well. What made this match and all of their matches so great and so riveting was their completely opposing approaches to the game. Borg was the greatest baseliner to play the game. It was nearly impossible to get get the ball by him. His steadiness and zen-like approach to the game gave birth to many baseliners in his wake, most notably someone like Andre Aggasi. McEnroe was was the first ever punk rock athelete. No player in history had shown so much anger and rage, but mostly so much desire to win. It was raw rock n roll. It was a bit of a paradox because though he was a punk rocker in his attitude and in his passion, his game was a throwback to Rod Laver. He was an artist on the court. On any given point you might see topspin forehands, slice backhands, drop shots, lobs, breath taking volleys, and backhand overheads. He had a complete game. While Borg was content to outhit his opponents, McEnroe was eager to cut the points short. He would take every opportunity to come into the net and display his artistry. Of course none of this is apparent in the film. The problem with sports films is that most actors are not atheletes. So a director has to be inventive in his camera work to cover the fact that his actors don't know how to play. A rally with Borg might go 15 Strokes. Tennis is about court position. For McEnroe to beat Borg he had to chose his spots. When is the right time to approach the net? Where do you hit the ball when you are there? Shia was quoted as saying that he despised tennis and he hopes to never play again. He clearly chose this roll, not to impress us with his tennis skills, but because he wanted to play McEnroe the man. This film unfortunately climaxes with the finals match at Wimbledon, normally something I would enjoy because after all this film is about tennis, but it is shot so horribly that you never see Borg hitting back 10-15 groundstrokes. You never see his unquie at the time, 2 handed backhand Vs Mac's classical one handed. You never see Borg trying to pass Mac at the net. You never see the tennis artistry of McEnroe at all in this film. The way it is shot you really only see the the players heads and quick 2 stroke rallies which is like going to see Miles Davis play Mary had a Little Lamb for 2 hours. I feel bad for tennis players because they will feel cheated like I did by this film, but I feel worse the non-tennis fans because they will walk away from this film and completely miss how revolutionary and inspiring these two great athletes are. They might just shrug and say ""what's the big deal?""That is a crime.",negative
Borg vs. McEnroe,"It's the summer of 1980 and Björn Borg (Sverrir Gudnason) is the top tennis player in the world, dominating the sport both on and off the court. A powerful and rigorously disciplined player, there is only one obstacle in his pursuit of a record-breaking fifth Wimbledon championship: the highly talented but ferociously abrasive young American, John McEnroe (a perfectly cast Shia LaBeouf). With three days until the tournament begins, Borg trains religiously in his lavish Monaco home, aided by his coach and mentor Lennart (Stellan Skarsgård) and girlfriend Mariana (Tuva Novotny). But McEnroe's explosive confidence and wrecking-ball persona continue to infiltrate Borg's ice-cool and normally unshakable temperament. With each man the antithesis of the other, both players delve into their formative memories as the climactic tournament draws near and anticipation reaches fever pitch. Visceral and breathlessly tense, the match itself - regarded as one of the greatest of all time - would mark the pinnacle of the 'Fire and Ice' rivalry between Borg and McEnroe; an exhilarating battle of personalities that set the world of tennis alight.",positive

Maudie,"There is quote by Kurt Vonnegut that comes to mind when I think of Maudie, the latest film based on the real life and times of an artist. ""Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possibly can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something."" That may sound like a backhanded compliment but if Maud Lewis was portrayed accurately in the film, I doubt she'll mind. To her painting wasn't a source of ego or pride. It was something she just did - to make herself happy - and if it made others happy all the better.The film picks up with Maudie, played with understated sensitivity by Sally Hawkins, as she struggles and fails to earn the respect of her family. Despite her severe arthritis, Maudie answers an advert for a live-in maid and runs away. She moves in with and eventually marries the crotchety Everett Lewis (Hawke), a fishmonger who manages to put on a grim smile but once over the film's 40+ year time span. After a time living in Everett's dimly lit squalor, Maudie relights her passion for painting using abandoned cork board and the walls of her new home to paint continuously.The true-life Maudie was eventually considered Canada's most popular and prolific folk artist; though one could hardly tell given the solitude that follows Maudie throughout her life. In the film, she remains isolated, largely due to her debilitating arthritis and painful shyness around strangers. There's one awkward scene early on where Maud struggles to shuffle out of a doorway and stick her head out long enough to compliment a woman's shoes. In that moment we realize her deep desire to be both accepted and left alone.The film aptly compliment's the artist's own frailties and unconventionality with a strikingly brittle and unconventional love story. Maud's warmth towards Everett is sincere and unconditional. She sees in him, a beautiful person - an outcast like her who has been made wild by the cruelties of life but nevertheless deserves her love. As open as Maudie is to the inner-beauties of a warm sunset, Everett remains as cold and brutal as a winter storm. Yet every time he ""puts a foot down,"" he wordlessly capitulates. He grumbles and erupts in objectively despicable behavior but Maud always seems to convince him that he's capable of love and being loved.The film continues down this path of bittersweet co-dependence and as the relationship develops, we see the results of Maud's patience and virtue. Thanks to the remarkably assured cinematography of Guy Godfree, the film crackles with natural beauty and warmth of a cozy hearth. There are some truly breathtaking natural vistas on display here, which despite their expanse manage to feel intimate and idyllic.As a film Maudie is certainly within the ranks of Mr. Turner (2014), My Left Foot (1989) and Lust for Life (1956). Much like those films, Maudie centers on the life of a tortured artist whose personal story tells something truly meaningful about the human condition. It also has a truly award-worthy performance by Sally Hawkins who is at this point in a class of her own.",negative
Maudie,"When you are compelled to write a review, and you realise this is your first ever review of a film, you then understand the impact that a true classic has.Sally Hawkins, Ethan Hawke, well done! If you want to sit down to a less than fast, but utterly embracing film about life's journey, and how individuals are valued, how they react to outside pressures and put their whole world at risk, then this is the film for you .Simply.. Brilliant.",positive
Queen of the Desert,"This film was an attractive costume drama which would not have been out of place on Masterpiece Theater, but anyone familiar with Gertrude Bell's achievements and who has read the book 'Desert Queen', will be disappointed at how much was left out. Yes, she was born to a wealthy family, had a brilliant mind, earned a first class degree at Oxford - even attending Oxford was a rarity for a woman at that time. She mixed in the best society being very well connected socially, and also enjoyed the company of many intellectuals of the day. Yes, she fell in love with Henry Cadogan and mourned his death for seven years. She had been prevented from marrying him by her overly possessive parents on some very flimsy grounds - he was a gambler and had no fortune, when they could have easily set up a trust fund for her which he could not touch. Her parents apparently even opened her mail to ensure that she was not being led astray. Her dutiful devotion and love for her parents may have caused her later infatuations and unrequited love for the wrong men. Her friendship with the married Doughty Wiley was shown, as was her iffy working relationship with T. E. Lawrence who supported her while being quite catty behind her back, but her later unrequited love for Henry Fitzsimmons, who used her but refused flat out to marry her, was not. Nor was her long and very close friendship with King Faisal of Iraq, which began when he was Prince and whom she had been instrumental in supporting on the throne. As Faisal's wife and family remained in Mecca and Gertrude became his close adviser, many suspected that they were lovers.Her years of round the world tours to get over Henry's death were left out. Eventually she began her journeys through the middle east and gained the knowledge which put her in the center of things in WWI as a source of information about the Arab tribes, and supporter and close adviser to King Faisal. She was present at the Paris Peace Conference when the winners, desperate to get their hands on the oil, divided up the middle east between them, largely reneging on the promises to allow the Arabs their own kingdom and instead installing puppet kingdoms under British and French mandates.The film ended with a very brief meeting with Faisal and his brother Abdullah, and an epilogue about the creation of Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia where Gertrude Bell had helped define the borders and choose the rulers. But there was much more to the story. After the heady success of helping to create the modern middle eastern kingdoms, being appointed Oriental Secretary awarded the CBE, and being Faisal's right hand woman, called upon every day not only for advice, but companionship, games, tennis, Gertrude found herself becoming less and less important as her task had ended. It probably did not help that she was a woman and had trodden on quite a few toes on the way up. Men would have felt threatened by her and wives would have been jealous. She concentrated her efforts on her writing and establishing the Baghdad Museum, but her life had become empty and no doubt she felt unwanted and useless. Faisal saw less of her and spent more time in Europe 'taking the cures'. Her family fortune disappeared in the post war changing times and she was reduced to living alone if not in poverty, but 'straightened circumstances'. In 1926 she died of an overdose of sleeping pills, which was ruled an accident.Other than leaving half the story out, the other serious flaw was the miscasting of Faisal and Abdullah and their very brief appearance at the close of the film. The two actors should have switched parts. Abdullah, the great grandson of today's King of Jordan, was short and round faced, Faisal was tall, thin, charismatic and extremely handsome. His leadership of the Arab revolt was the reason for the allied win over the Turks. From the film one would think she had only met with Faisal for one minute. Showing more of her relationship with Faisal would have perked up the film enormously. Overall, this topic should have been a Masterpiece Theater miniseries running for at least six hours.",negative
Queen of the Desert,"A film worth seeing, explains the birth of present middle east. A visionary feast and both Nicole Kidman and James Franco's acting is superb.Most critics didn't give it a thumbs up but for me it was a beautiful film, maybe because the lead was a woman who changed the course of history! For anyone who doesn't know anything about the middle east should see it just for history and Gertrude Bells significance in history.... The photography is exhilarating and get to see the desert and the oasis in their beauty. The movie might lack historical details but it focuses on Gertrude Bells life, so that is understandable. But at least for people who never knew what or how the middles east came about and what she did it is an eye opener. A must see file for me!",positive
Goodbye Christopher Robin,"Whenever I'm judging a biopic film, I always see if it passes my test of having that ""spark"" for why it needed to be made into a live-action portrayal of the events (or maybe should have just been a documentary). For the first 2/3 of ""Goodbye Christopher Robin"", it didn't (or just barely) passed that test. Fortunately, the final act really redeems it by adding in some emotion that truly felt real.For a basic plot summary, this film tells the story of how author A.A. Milne (Domhnall Gleeson) conceived his Winnie The Pooh books by watching the playtime of his son Christopher Robin (Will Tilston). The movie extends that lens, however, by continuing past the publication of the books and focusing on the struggles of an adolescent Christopher (Alex Lawther) and how much he resented being ""the real Christopher Robin"".Like I said above, the first 2/3 of ""Goodbye Christopher Robin"" were ""just okay"", and that is at best. At times it felt a bit emotionless and plodding, and I wondered if perhaps this story wasn't quite exciting enough to be worthy of a live-action biopic. Perhaps a well-constructed documentary would do on the subject? It just didn't seem to offer one single really interesting thing that wasn't either already shown in the trailer or couldn't be guessed by common sense for how reality transpires.But then, in quite a turnaround, the film really focuses in on the struggles of Christopher Robin post-Pooh, and that's where things really pick up steam (especially when Lawther's performances as Robin begin). This is where the film breaks from being just a ""straight Pooh origin story"" (of which it is passable at best) to being a deeper examination of emotional themes between individuals. These are the scenes in the film where I really felt like I cared about the people on screen, instead of just being told a story I basically already knew.In terms of acting, things often feel a bit stilted at certain points. Both Gleeson and Robbie (playing Christopher's mother) are great actors, but they perhaps seem a bit odd for their respective roles here. Robbie's character shined much as as a ""young mother"" and declined as the film went on, whereas I felt Gleeson's performance actually stepped up a notch as he portrayed an older father. In a lot of ways, though, the cinematography steals the show here, what with all the wonderful shots of the English countryside as well the noir, if you will, of London of that time period.Like most children, I went through a Winnie the Pooh phase, and that's obviously why a film like this appeals to so many viewers. This one will never be an out-and-out classic, but it can still be enjoyed, especially by those who prefer a more straightforward approach to biopics. The last portions of the film really make up for the paint-by-numbers approach in the early goings, too.",negative
Goodbye Christopher Robin,"REVIEW - GOODBYE CHRISTOPHER ROBIN Honestly didn't know what to expect when I went to see this film. As its based (loosely) around the creation of the Winnie The Poo stories I thought it was going to be a children's film but.......The film itself is actually and surprising very good, touching on the family dynamic of the upper classes during the 1930s to 1940s.Very stand offish parents who seem to care about their social standing rather than their son (Christopher Robin) and how this impacts on all of their lives. Looking at how one person can force the hand of another, in this case forcing father and son to actually spend time together and bond. Lessons can be learnt from this film, no matter how much you work, your children want you.Thoroughly enjoyable film on many levels. Rating 10 out of 10",positive
Love & Mercy,"Unfortunately, genius and mental illness sometimes go hand-in-hand. Too often, the kind of genius that represents truly original thought is so unusual that it's perceived as being ""crazy"", but when we're talking about a literal, clinically-defined mental or emotional impairment, the issue becomes whether the mental illness is the cause or the result of the sick person's genius. It's a kind of chicken-egg question, but no matter which came first, mental illness hurts. It hurts the person suffering from it and those who care about him or her and, left untreated (or poorly treated), it can destroy those interpersonal relationships and, of course, the person who is ill – genius and all. This was the problem, and nearly the fate, of Brian Wilson, founder of The Beach Boys. Wilson's struggle is the focus of the innovative and insightful biopic ""Love & Mercy"" (PG-13, 2:01).Part of the problem in describing this movie is that the term ""biopic"" applies only in the loosest sense. This film is not a valentine to the Beach Boys, or even a chronicle of all the important events in the life of Wilson himself. The story's unusual structure is meant to convey a single major issue in his life – an ongoing struggle with mental illness. The plot revolves around two pivotal periods in Wilson's personal history – the late 1960s and the late 1980s – when his illness began to have a significant effect on his life, and, later, when the treatment he received was exposed as more harmful than helpful and Wilson was able to start receiving proper care. Constructed as it is, the film's creative team decided to have two actors play Wilson – Paul Dano for the earlier portion of the story and John Cusack for the later part. Those separate periods in Wilson's life unfold throughout the movie, which skillfully alternates between scenes from each, similar to the way ""The Godfather, Part II"" tells its tale, but without the sense that the earlier scenes are flashbacks. Both stories are told chronologically and as if they are happening simultaneously, both bringing Wilson's life to points of crisis and ultimately, to redemption.The late 1960s' Brian Wilson was a young genius, at the height of his powers. A few well-chosen scenes (displayed as if they're bits of genuine archival footage) show The Beach Boys at their most popular – clean-cut California kids cranking out hit after feel-good hit. By the late 60s, most of their biggest hits are behind them and Wilson is trying to move the band in new directions, gaining inspiration from his natural musical talent, innate creativity, some illicit drugs, and the voices and music that he hears in his head. The main focus in the late 60s scenes is the production of the classic album ""Pet Sounds"", which was critically acclaimed (and is now considered one of the greatest albums of all time), but was dispassionately received by many Beach Boys fans due to its radical departure from the band's signature upbeat songs. Except for a few scenes in which we see the band create ""Good Vibrations"", the focus is not so much on the music as on the man. It's a very human story which is both more personal and more relatable than a traditional biopic.The late 1980s' Brian Wilson is a broken man being rebuilt by the radical 24-hour therapy of his psychiatrist and legal guardian, Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti). There are bits of dialog to let us know how Wilson got to this point and how much Landy did to bring him back from the brink, but most of what we see in these portions of the story is the complete control that Landy exercises over his patient's daily life and personal affairs. Landy, or those on his staff, follow Wilson everywhere he goes. We can tell by the way Wilson talks and acts that he needs some level of supervision. What isn't as clear is whether his need for Landy's care has more to do with Wilson's actual mental state, the huge amount of medication Landy has Wilson taking or the near complete physical, mental and emotional dependence that Landy has caused Wilson to have on him. This is the situation that Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks) walks into. She's a former model who is now selling cars. She and Brian meet when he comes to buy a Cadillac from the dealership where she works. In spite of Wilson's off-beat way of talking, Melinda is drawn to his sweet and fragile disposition and it's obvious that Wilson is immediately attracted to her too. As the two grow closer and Landy allows her, as he says ""unprecedented access"" to Wilson's life, she sees Landy's manipulations for what they are and feels compelled to help, regardless of the cost.Those who can watch ""Love & Mercy"" without being distracted by the unconventional story-telling style are likely to find it both enlightening and enjoyable. The film provides rare insights into mental illness and shines a light on the need for the families and friends of such patients to remain active and attentive regarding their loved one's care. Beach Boys fans, and really, all music fans, will enjoy seeing the creative process behind one of the most important influences in the history of American popular music. And those who like a good romance or human drama will get that too. Last but not least, movie fans will appreciate the outstanding performances and will likely hope, as I do, that they are remembered come the next awards season. However, the film has a few too many slow moments, it could have done a better job of filling in some of the obvious gaps in the story, and the prevailing tone of the film is a little depressing, but its compelling story told in such an original way with such great actors outweighs its few imperfections.

Love & Mercy,"Anyone who knows me knows my favorite band is The Beach Boys, and my favorite musician is their leader, Brian Wilson. I first got deep into their music last November when I heard their album SMiLE, an album which wasn't officially released until 45 years after its conception and recording. It was worth the wait, as I consider it the best album I've ever heard.I found out that a biopic of Wilson was in the works, and would be screening at SXSW with Wilson in attendance. I knew I had to go and see this film. The experience is one that will stick with me for the rest of my life as one of the most emotionally powerful events I have been a part of.Love and Mercy is the story of The Beach Boys' founder Brian Wilson. The film chronicles his rise to fame in the 1960's and the his decline into mental illness, and his escape from the control of his therapist in the 1980's.Paul Dano plays Wilson in the 1960's, and John Cusack plays him in the 1980's. It also stars Elizabeth Banks as Wilson's future wife, Melinda Ledbetter, and Paul Giamatti as his therapist, Eugene Landy.Paul Dano exudes the boyish look of young Wilson perfectly. He relearned how to play piano for the role, and sings much of the music in the film.His performance is hard to watch at times because of how depressing it is seeing him devolve from an energetic, fun young man into a tortured, drained artist. Dano handles the role with passion and care, and his performance never feels forced or fake.When Wilson begins to suffer a panic attack, anyone who's had one will feel deeply for him. When he starts to have physical symptoms of depression after years of physical and mental abuse from his father and disapproval of his musical direction from fellow band mate Mike Love, Dano portrays the hurt that comes from those events with subtle facial expressions and natural transition.John Cusack looks less like Wilson physically, but his performance may be even more complex. His Wilson has been to the bottom, and he brilliantly portrays how challenging it is to rebuild your life after going through mental and physical anguish.Elizabeth Banks has a great departure from her more well known comedic film roles, and as Ledbetter, she shows her strength and respect for the man she loves through actions and subtle expressions instead of overt, over the top dialog.Paul Giamatti has the most campy role in the film as Eugene Landy, but this is unfortunately how Landy was in real life. He was as violent and controlling over Wilson's life as the movie portrays, so his abusive, manipulative, angering performance is highly accurate.One of the best things about Love and Mercy is that it doesn't exaggerate or make up events to make the film more interesting. The filmmakers trust the strength of its source material is interesting enough to make for a great story.The storytelling structure of the movie is interesting and risky. The film jumps from the 60's to the 80's without warning, and it works. The slightly askew technique allows the audience to experience the downfall and uprising of Wilson's life simultaneously, and allows the movie to end on a happy note.One complaint people have is that the film skips over the 1970's, Wilson's most tumultuous period in which he weighed 300 pounds and spent the majority of three years in bed, crippled by depression and drug addiction. However, this allows the audience to examine the reasons for his downfall and redemption instead of indulging in the horrible escapism Wilson turned to.Beach Boys fans will appreciate the movie more than the average film-goer. Mike Love in hats, dancing, and mentioning ""the formula""? Check. Drug tent and piano in the sandbox in Wilson's living room? Check. The infamous ""Fire"" session? Check. Everything is on point, from the scarily accurate wardrobe down to recreating the ""Sloop John B."" and ""Surf's Up"" promo videos shot for shot. It's these moments that show the film was made by fans with an attention for detail.Almost every song on the album Pet Sounds is featured in the film somewhere. Seeing Wilson's unorthodox recording techniques is such a pleasure for music nerds.Cinematographer Robert Yeoman, best known for creating the look of Wes Anderson's films, blends stylistic tone with realistic camera work, creating a sense of false nostalgia that is surreal yet inviting and intense.Composer Atticus Ross works wonders with the score, using a great wealth of Wilson's music in different ways and choosing songs that fit with the emotional tone of the scene brilliantly. Hearing the instrumental version of ""Don't Talk"" play as Wilson takes LSD for the first time is haunting. Witnessing the song ""Til' I Die"" play over a surreal, Kubrickian scene in which Wilson has an epiphany made me cry because of the powerful combination of imagery and music.The film is being released on June 5, to capitalize on The Beach Boys music being a staple of the summer, but it feels more like a Thanksgiving release to me. The cinematography, acting, script, and score are all Oscar worthy in my opinion, but the film may get lost in the race to other contenders, which is a shame.Love and Mercy is an awesome, unorthodox biopic that takes risks with form and narrative that has strong performances, script, cinematography, and of course, an amazing soundtrack. It will expose young people to the brilliance of Wilson's music and give older fans an insight into why Wilson is the poster boy for using creativity as an escape and an outlet from the pain of life and mental illness.And seriously, listen to the album SMiLE.",positive
Thank You for Your Service,"I picked this up by happenstance at my local library - and enjoyed it more than I expected.
It's intelligent (despite some soldier antics at the beginning). It never becomes maudlin or overbearing in portraying PTSD. Also it is a fine performance from the main actor Miles Teller.
This film grows on you grows on you as its story progresses.
It successfully depicts the lasting after affects of war on the young soldiers who go to battle, in this case Iraq. I have also read that those who re-deploy are the ones most susceptible to lasting psychic damage.",negative

Stockholm,"There's something so amazing about a film that can keep you on your toes with it's fast-paced action and consistently funny antics as ""Stockholm"" does. Despite being a known true story of the origin of Stockholm Syndrome, the film was able to make me excited to see what happened next as it captivated me through well-written dialogue and incredible characterization of the few main characters. After watching this film and mediating on it for a while, I was struck by the fact that director Robert Budreau was able to perfectly capture the essence of the syndrome, even making me root for the captor, Lars Nystrom (Ethan Hawke), as the film progressed. I found it so interesting that the Budreau was able to do this with every detail, right down to the music. The music was easy to listen to being upbeat and chill, completely counteractive to the action on the screen but perfectly fitting to the character of Nystrom. The cinematography used in the film also helped develop this reaction as each scene was filmed to masterfully capture the emotion meant to be felt using dark versus light lighting and muted versus bright colors as they developed throughout the film, paralleling the unfolding character of Nystrom. This film was interesting and all in all wonderful to watch; I highly suggest you take the time to see it.",negative
Stockholm,"Stockholm can be described as a fun and comedic film, covering a dark subject matter in order to show its audience how human beings cope with stressful, life threatening situations. The film is based on the Swedish bank heist, and hostage situation, that would later inspire the coining of the phrase ""Stockholm syndrome,"" which describes the phenomenon of a hostage forming a bond with their captor. Of the many things the film does well, what stands above the rest is the films ability to make the audience realize how someone might actually succumb to Stockholm syndrome. The main anti-hero of the story, Lars (Ethan Hawke), shows early on that all he really wants is to get his buddy, Gunnar (Mark Strong), out of jail. You the audience member even find yourself sympathizing with him as over the course of the film he goes out of his way to care for his hostages including letting one of them, Bianca (Noomi Rapace), use the telephone to call her family. The comedy in the film comes across quite well, at some points I found myself audibly laughing, and allows the audience to establish a better connection with Lars. Apart from the story, the 70's aesthetics were executed perfectly with a very pleasing color pallet focusing on shades of orange and teal, wonderful b-roll of a 70's Stockholm, and a few Bob Dylan songs thrown in for good measure. It was very enjoyable to watch and had my interest peaked right from the get-go.",positive
The Zookeeper's Wife,"WARNING, CONTAINS SPOILERSI went in not expecting much and I got exactly what I expected... I would have probably even had a better experience staring at a black screen for two hours, eating my popcorn.This movie lacked pretty much everything a movie needs. To say it was a slow pace would be too much credit, there was no pace at all, it dragged itself on with no direction, nothing happening, utterly boring.So many silly goofs going on, like feeding pigs with garbage from the ghetto... garbage from a ghetto? What garbage, they'd eat everything till the very last scrap. Or another idiotic scene near the end of the movie where Lutz makes Rys lock his mother up, after they just walked through the tunnel... that would take you back to the broken down door in like 1 minute... Why would Lutz even bother at all to find out how many Jews escaped through the zoo, what does it matter at that point? The war was over, all any Nazi would be interested in at that stage was to get the hell out of there.Watching this movie to me was certainly the biggest waste of time and money in several years.",negative
The Zookeeper's Wife,"Firstly, I'm quite shocked by the negative reviews. This film stands up next to classics, in particular Schindler's List, to depict the horror of the Jewish suffering and violation in Eastern Europe in WW2. It is not so graphic but shows the lengths non-Jewish people went to, to save their fellow human beings. Intensely poignant and heartbreaking at times. Yes it's not all about zoo animals but that's not really the point. A tale worth telling, and very well told.",positive

"McFarland, USA","I had read the story of Jim White and the McFarland cross country team long before the movie came out. I was glad to see it made into a feature film, but Disney's heavy hands keep it from being fully satisfying.Most of the actors playing larger roles acquit themselves well. Yes, Kevin Costner is his overly familiar world-weary self, but there's always a certain charm in seeing him inhabit that role. Many of the young men portraying McFarland's runners are both charming and believable, and some of the quirky townspeople (such as the mother of three runners and the owner of the local variety store) add nice depth to the story.In addition, the scenery is interesting, from the running trails to the fields where the McFarland runners pick crops.One real turnoff was when, repeatedly, opposing runners were shown talking smack before the start of races, and opposing coaches made snarky comments about the McFarland team. I've coached youth sports for many years and am accustomed to seeing much better sportsmanship than that. The movie makers apparently needed to set up cartoonish villains so that the audience would root even harder for the good guys.Another clunker came at the first race, the ""Palo Alto Invitational."" The race director was surprised when McFarland showed up - but if it was an ""invitational,"" then either they'd been invited (so he shouldn't have been surprised) or they hadn't been (in which case they had no business going to the race).This was a generally pleasant two hours, and it was good to know that the basic heartwarming events took place in real life. Could have been better (or at least less bad in some parts), but it was OK. I recommend you find the story ""Running for Their Lives"" by Gary Smith, the captivating real-life tale of Jim White and McFarland (told as only the brilliant Smith could).",negative
"McFarland, USA","After a million years as an IMDb member I'm finally inspired to write a review. This movie is guileless and sweet in the most beautiful way. Not heavy-handed, no huge buildup over the races (in all aspects of the word), but rather huge focus on interpersonal relationships and the judgments every human makes about one another. There's also huge pride in the small working towns I've personally driven through on my way to somewhere else, and the seemingly small people whose backs we live off of. There is so much heart here. I'm surprised this is a Disney movie.Anyway, I believe love drives us. And this is such an affirmation of the different types of love and relationships that can push us in the best ways and help us achieve greatness. I'm so deeply pleased to have seen this film. Every one of us has a moment or period when we are down for the count. We don't always handle it with grace. That doesn't mean we are without grace.",positive
Truth,"I see a lot of glowing reviews on here, but I feel they have more to do with people's own view of what they want journalism to be. At the end of the day, the movie reveals no ""truth"" and fails to lay out clearly why the accusations against Bush did not stick. At the end of the day, it was poor journalistic practice for such renowned reporters.As far as movie-making is concerned - it didn't do much to build drama. In my opinion, Turth was slow, under-developed and preachy.There was the added irony that it kept pronouncing how ""the truth matters,"" but the protagonists fell short of meeting their own standard. Hard to feel bad for the characters when faced with such blatant hypocrisy.I chose to watch this hoping it was a ""new-era"" All the President's Men. It wasn't anywhere close. Go back and enjoy the original.",negative
Truth,"""Absolute truth is a very rare and dangerous commodity in the context of professional journalism."" Hunter S. Thompson Every journalism student should see Truth, a true version of a true event that included liberal CBS; liberal anchor, Dan Rather (Robert Redford); and liberal producer for 60 minutes, Mary Mapes (Cate Blanchett). The latter two sacrificed their jobs possibly for the ideal of bringing down George W. Bush in his campaign to become president for the second time.The journalists thought they had a story about Bush slacking in his National Guard tour, but what they had was forged documents that eventually cost them their jobs and credibility. Mapes was the prime agent of the fiasco, pushing to get a story on 60 Minutes when it was too close to deadline and more substantiation was needed for the source and his documents.First-time director and seasoned-writer James Vanderbilt takes an almost cool approach, not quite as weighty as All the President's Men or as frenetic; the journalists young and old struggle with the profession's verity: Vet your stories and your sources until they bleed truth. Mapes and her vigilantes are up against a deadline, so more verifying of documents and sources is not possible. Thus, they should not have run with the story, but they did. Dan Rather, for all his experience as CBS news anchor, should not have trusted in Mapes' research, but he did.Most of all they should not have trusted Lt. Colonel Bill Burkett (Stacy Keach), who provided the documents purporting to show Bush's slacking. Because Burkett was a known liar and fervent Kerry supporter, no one should have trusted him before corroborating his information. Journalism students, beware of cutting corners on the road to truth. The film is an excellent primer on best practices.Truth is a classy, almost unbiased rendition of a true story, an entertaining thriller filled with first-rate actors. If there is one flaw, I submit for your consideration that the film is too reverent of Mapes and Rather, who made a blunder unworthy of their status and experience. They are more heroic than they deserve.

Jobs,"Whoever thought the Kutcher could play Steve Jobs needs their head examined! He makes the movie so difficult to watch (where was the director for God's sake!).But the problems don't end there. Jobs' life is only partially portrayed, so if you only know about Jobs being at Apple--that is still pretty much all you know about him. Engineers are portrayed, as they typically are in ""Hollywood"" films--nerdy enough to be uncool.Where is the story??!! Most people will be lost, there is not much continuity, and you are left at the end wondering why you came to the movie. You didn't learn anything new about Jobs, you are not sure what the point was, and yet you spent two painful hours trying to get something out of this film.It's a shame this movie was so awful.",negative
Jobs,"This movie easily ranks among the movies I most disagree with the critics on.Why they HATE it?BIASIt's painfully obvious that their was a ""Kutcher bias."" The last thing nerds and GROUP-THINK-CRITICS are going to be open to is a model-turned-actor taking on the role of one of the most accomplished men of his generation, esp. so soon after his death.Not only did he nail the role, but he took the responsibility so seriously, and did such a great job, that he actually paid homage to the much deserving Jobs.ALL BIAS.I admit. I was bias too......until I saw how much Kutcher embodied Jobs. I couldn't believe he could do it. I didn't think he had it in him. I was wrong.This is coming from a cinephile EXTREMELY sensitive to poor acting, and yet Kutcher sold me--hook, line, and sinker. Not only did Kutcher nail the role, but it was a DAMN GOOD MOVIE.I've seen it twice now, and I look forward to the next time. It is inspiring, and it engenders that sense of magic and possibilities so few movies do.It is just a great, gripping, story. I was ""in it"" every step of the way. I didn't see Kutcher.

Loving Pablo,"This film tells the life of Pablo Escobar and his mistress Virginia.The story is captivating because it is intense and suspenseful. There is a constant threat of danger to all the characters involved. Many people lose their lives, yet fortunately the film is not too graphically gory. I feel sorry for the characters, and what happened to them.",negative
Loving Pablo,"Loving Pablo has certainly moments of guilty pleasure but leaves an empty feeling when reaching the end. This is the story of the rise and fall of Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar. The very clever pairing of Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz as the strongly larger-than-life couple gave this production a shot at the international box office before it will go to smaller screens. Very much action-packed, Loving Pablo marks a turn towards the mainstream for Fernando Leon de Aranoa, the Spanish writer-director best known for social and political dramas. 
What ends up holding the film down to its level of superficial glitz is being adapted from Vallejo's novel/memoir Loving Pablo, Hating Escobar. The story is told almost on that basis and that's the min limit.",positive

This is proselytizing, pure and simple. This ""film"" doesn't elevate anything that it tries to. It tries to find salvation from its shortcomings.

The Man Who Knew Infinity,"Anyone who rates this movie under the 7 is insensible in my opinion. I watched 22 movies last 2.5 months at the cinema like Suicide Squad, Tarzan and Jason Bourne, all nice movies, but The Man Who Knew Infinity was the best one. Its different than the common action movies because the storyline is truly happened, it's educational and full of emotion. There are a lot of details telling the story of Ramanujan, about the culture from England and from India and from pieces of the history. With pieces of humor and great actors the movie was for my amazing. I think many people can learn from a movie like this.I recommend this movie to everyone who is interested in a beautiful story which is truly happened years ago.",negative
The Man Who Knew Infinity,"An important film; cleverly mixing a love story with the equally deep themes of moral obligations on privilege to raise those without. At first I was concerned I would not be able to disassociate Dev Patel from the role on Marigold Hotel, but after a few lines which sounded too contemporary, he improved significantly. Jeremy Irons was captivating and the other roles adequately developed. The direction, pace, setting, wardrobe, story, score -all hold the attention.When I watched it, at the end, the audience applauded. In fact at the end of it, one wishes it could last longer - craving more.",positive
The Grandmaster,"Sadly speaking, ""The Grandmaster"" does not get a grand score from me.Before this film, 3 movies have been made about Ip Man, with the first two by Donnie Yen. Like it or not, first movers always have an advantage. The prequel of Ip Man - ""A Legeng is Born - Ip Man"" - did pretty well, featuring a Wing Chun practitioner Dennis To. But, in my opinion, all these 3 movies did not sufficiently capture aspects of the Man's life stories that many fans are looking for - his philosophy about Wing Chun, how he took up Wing Chun, and, of course, his mentor-ship of Bruce Lee.""The Grandmaster"", in my opinion, missed this golden opportunity to satisfy the thirst of martial arts fans on these aspects.For one, I am surprised to see that the script chose to focus on something other than Wing Chun - the so-called ""64 forms"", a kind of martial art - and revolve around the relationship between Man and Gong Er (Zhang Ziyi), with a rather strange majority of screen time placed on Er. In fact, I strongly suspected that the ""Grandmaster"" in the film is actually Gong Er and not Ip Man (and perhaps this film will be so successful in this respect that there will be another film on Gong Er?)I believe audeince is in for the story behind Ip Man, Wing Chun and Bruce Lee, not ""64 forms"" or the fictitious Gong Er. It is clearly focus misplaced.The fighting sequence is a major disappointment as well. Fighting sequence is barely 5 moves in total, with the camera zooming in on to the hands or legs and, which is my pet peeve, the overuse of slow motion and special effects that obscure the real beauty of the moves. I am not sure whether these effects are specially chosen to mask the fact that Tony Leung is not a martial artist, but applying these on veterans such as Zhang Ziyi - who has learn some martial arts before - is a waste of talents.Taking a step back, I suspect that the producers and director seemed to want to break away from the proved formula of story-telling about Ip Man and Wing Chun, and took risk in the script and even cinematography. However, I see traces of Zhang Yimou in the technique, which I neither am opposed to nor strongly encouraged. However, I think the director OVERDID on the special and visual effects, because, in my opinion, he may have wanted every scene and frame to be visually stunning. While there are many scenes (including the special effects) that are indeed very captivating - e.g. those at the train station involving the duel of Gong Er and San - these effects quickly became a major muddling distraction for me, to an extent that I felt like the film has overrun in length in its appeal to audience.I prefer a film that takes care of its basics well, before venturing into the visual/special effects (what I consider icing on the cake). In any story involving Ip Man, the basics should be the man, his family, his time and his Wing Chun.Finally, the film applied another technique often seen in Zhang Yimou's films - the somewhat emotionally derived script with somewhat wooden expressions on its casts, with a hope to create an ambiance of mystery and helplessness (e.g. in a time that saw China fell into the hands of the Japanese during World War II). Personally, this technique is a waste of the acting talents of the likes of Tony Leung and Zhang Ziyi.""The Grandmaster"" is clearly a focus misplaced.I had higher hopes for anything Ip Man and Wing Chun.",negative
The Grandmaster,"THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE INTERNATIONAL CUT, NOT THE 'HARVEY WEINSTEIN' American VERSION:It was finally time for the great iconoclastic Hong Kong director to turn to martial arts in his intense and atmospheric telling of the great grandmaster teacher, Ip man, and he doesn't disappoint.Wong Kar-wai brings the poetic beauty of his ""In the Mood for Love"" to this Chinese action genre and executes it with a precise rhythmic heightening reminiscent of Sam Peckinpah at his best, while bringing out the experience of living through the Japanese invasion of China during WWII.The cast is magnificent, especially Tony Leung as the Ip man and Ziyi Zhang as Gong Er who perfectly embodies a kung-fu mistress trying to avenge her father.A Wong masterpiece to put on a level with his finest work!PS: One particular reviewer earlier criticized the editing of this film which, to me, smacks of putting down the film for not being more conventional. Sometimes it is difficult to put aside expectations of what one wants a film to be in favor of what the actual film on the screen is. ""The Grandmaster"" is, in fact, brilliantly edited. Wong is, if nothing else, a perfectionist in taking years to mold his assembled footage into his own personal rhythmic poem, idiosyncratically emphasizing downbeats and rests as precise as a great composer. What you see here is Wong Kar-wai's personal vision, take it or leave it. I wouldn't change a frame, or a single edit. It strikes me as a perfect diamond by this exceptional, if eccentric, cinema artist.",positive

Several of the comments that took offense to the movie should go back and try to see the background behind this to assess its veracity.As for the actual movie in term of script and acting My actual rating is 7.

Behind The Candelabra,"This movie about Liberace's relationship with Thorson is wonderfully acted by Douglas and Damon, effectively filmed, well written, and, for me, not especially enjoyable. I found Damon's powerlessness in the relationship depressing, and while Douglas makes Liberace seem pretty likable, his actions are insufferably egocentric and inconsiderate. Since the book this was based on was written by a jilted lover, it may or may not reflect much truth, but it's still a depressing story.It's hard to know how real any of this is. The plastic surgeon is so disturbing looking that it's hard to believe anyone would go under his knife (the single image I could find of him through google did not look nearly as freakish) and even though Douglas does a great job of nuancing Liberace into a real person in spite of his quirky voice and mannerisms, parts of the movie seem rather cartoonish. It's nice we've reached a point where major Hollywood actors will take a chance on material like this; it's a movie that doesn't shy away from sex the way earlier movies about gay people did. But I just never could get into it.",negative
Behind The Candelabra,"Congrats to HBO for having the guts to produce a script which mainstream studios refused to consider. ""Behind The Candelabra"" gives us a story about Liberace's personal life, from the POV of his one time lover, ""blond Adonis"" Scott Thorson. The plot spans some ten years, from 1977 to Liberace's death in 1987.Aside from his public persona, Liberace (Michael Douglas) comes across as egotistical, daring, self-absorbed, and to some extent old-fashioned in his values and beliefs. Scott Thorson (Matt Damon) comes across as passive, a tad lazy, and lacking in foresight and intellect. The plot's first half presents us with a love story. In the second half, reality sets in. One gets the feeling that though there may have been love between the two, Scott is just one more object for Liberace to collect, which was easy for him given his wealth. That kind of material relationship speaks poorly of both men.This film has a big cast, and some well-known names. Rob Lowe is terrific as a humorously bizarre plastic surgeon. Debbie Reynolds, as Lee's elderly mother, is so good that she is unrecognizable. Nearly all of the actors give fine performances. Michael Douglas especially deserves credit given that Liberace's mannerisms and image are so well known.Lavish custom costumes, detailed and elaborate production design, tons of subtle and not-so-subtle makeup all combine to add enormously to the story's credibility, as does the cinematography. Interior lighting makes Liberace's on-stage performances come alive. Music is, not unexpectedly, what Liberace liked, to some extent stuffy and old-fashioned.I was never a Liberace fan. But he was a much-beloved entertainer and talented pianist, who had a long show business career. That the Hollywood studios turned this script down tells us a great deal about Hollywood. The real hero in this film is not a character so much as it is HBO. Maybe there is hope that quality films can still be made, despite cowardly industry insiders.",positive
Mary Shelley,"I'm a sucker for artist biog movies.The storyline is interesting to keep you watching - well, keep me watching, anyway - as it runs through the events and experiences which supposedly contributed to the writing of Frankenstein. I don't know enough about her actual history to say how true or not is is but it seems feasible in a movie sort of way.One aspect of life at that time it does highlight is the (little) regard in which women and creative women were held.The stars are excellent. Douglas Booth in particular makes a text-book Shelly.So, what's wrong with it?Well, it generally lacks drive and it's not as gripping as you're probably entitled to think a movie about the creator of Frankenstein should be. There are masses of fantastic characters - Shelly, Byron, Godwin, Polidori - but their interactions are mundane. There is one tense scene where Shelly and Byron meet but it all just fizzles out and reverts to the mundaneness which had gone before.It's interesting as a possible biog and worth watching if you enjoy these types of movie but it just doesn't have the pizazz to make it stand out.",negative
Mary Shelley,"I affectionately commend Director Haifaa Al-Mansour's astute and tender depiction of the life of Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin (Mary Shelley), played by the talented Elle Fanning. I loved the entire cast. It was beautifully written. I have not watched a movie that has touched me so deeply in quite some time. It brought tears to my eyes and made me truly understand the novel Frankenstein at an even deeper level. I have a profound respect for the novel now, which was truly unconventional for the period. Mary Shelley creatively portrayed the feminist plight in the early 19th century by using a male character in the form of a monster. At the time, I doubt that anyone who read it when it was distributed without the name of the author took it as more than a horror story. She went from publisher to publisher and no one really got it or gave it a chance because she was a woman. I loved that they show the relationship between Mary and her father, who never truly abandons her, but grooms her and believes in her even though he does not always agree with her choices. It is a love story and a detailed memoir of Mary Shelley's plight as a woman living in that century. Anyone who has ever been young and in love should be touched. It is a reminder of that period in life when we are all trying to find ourselves despite religion, culture, and family beliefs. Al-Mansour shows the good, the bad and the ugly in people's characters through the various characters in the movie. She also shows that true love between people is them accepting each other for who they really are and standing by them despite their flaws. Frankenstein was created with the hopes and expectations that he would be the perfect human being. However, like all humans, he is inevitably flawed, and therefore unloved, and unwanted by those who cannot truly love unconditionally or see the beauty beyond the external appearance. I usually do not rate anything at a 9 but I was happily surprised by Al-Mansour's vision. I loved the originality and the risks she took in making this adaptation of Mary Shelley's journey from a child to a well-known and highly admired novelist. Again, I love that her father played such a vital role in providing her with the confidence, respect, and love that made her such a strong woman. While she had her mother's personality and fiery spirit, it was tempered by her father's belief in her abilities and his constant acknowledgement that she had a beautifully creative mind. Her father challenged her to be her very best.",positive
Hands of Stone,"For a biographical movie is good, mainly because, unlike to others in this genre, the actors speaks in the languages of the real people they portraits. But for a boxing movie, at times fails with the romantic drama scenes but mainly for the over egocentric personality of the main character, Roberto Durán. Also the script doesn't show the public enough matches. The highlights of the film, obviously, is Edgar Ramirez performance, but in my opinion, gives me a mixed perspective...in one hand, a confident and charismatic Durán, in the other hand, sadly, a man who blames his father for leaving his family and uses that as an excuse for his hate to U.S.A. is kinda annoying, also he thinks he's unstoppable even with his coach, Ray Arcel, played by Robert de Niro. Despite all this, the simple script is saved by some aspects. One is the costume design, because the movie occurs in many years, and the clothes tells us the time In which the characters live. The good technical aspects, like photography, sound mixing and editing, and film editing too, gives the film a better look. In overall, this movie is better enjoyed if you seek a mix between sports, drama and romance but not at its best.",negative
Hands of Stone,"Roberto Duran's (Edgar Ramirez) story goes beyond his rise, fall and comeback to the ring. Its shaped by the political turmoil in Panama during the 70's and the early 80's so when he confronts Sugar Ray Leonard (Usher), his stakes are as high as to carry along his nation's pride with him. His trainer Ray Arcel (DeNiro), shapes him from a bully in search for revenge, into a Champion who's at his best after he realizes dignity is much more than just winning the belt. Many have won fights but few fighters have won the respect of their foes as did Duran and Sugar Ray back in the days. True heroes with Hands Of Stone and Hearts of Gold.",positive
A Walk in the Woods,"i was excited to see this film, the trailer looked good, but as is always the case nowadays. all the best bits are in the trailer. spoiler alerts!! i was bored watching this film, and the Redford and Nolte casting was wrong, as they were both 70 odd , but in the book they are in their 40's!. Also Katz in the book is very annoying, totally unlikeable, whereas , Nolte is a lovable rogue in the film, i saw Robert Redford was executive producer, so he may have paid for the film, hence he got star billing, even though he looked nothing like bill bryson, no beard, no paunch. this film would be fine on a Sunday afternoon TV film, i wouldn't recommend this film to anybody, and especially not bryson fans",negative
A Walk in the Woods,"I have NOT read the book...So the little 'incorrect' things or the little incongruities don't mean a thing to me. This movie is a delight to watch unfold. And soooo funny! I loved the contrast between Redford and Nolte, they really complimented each other; loved the unexpected people, and outrageous incidents. It was interesting to learn about the trail and trail-hiking--the hikers seem a special group of people. And it was interesting to learn about the problems of the forests, although I wonder what can be done about it (nothing stopped the American Chestnut blight). The scenery was beautiful--I would have liked even more shots. Best of all, however, was the hilarity. We all were holding our sides! Nolte was grand. Redford was elegant and refined. Emma Thompson is wonderful in every part she plays. And Mary Steenburgen is still so beautiful. It was good to see them all!",positive
A Prayer Before Dawn,"Great cinematography. Realistic prison drama. Fighting sequences OK.
Background story non-existent, IMO main character or story not interesting and you dont get to know the main protagonist at all, viewer is left to his own conclusions.
Lots of loose ends, no development between characters, despite years of incarceration in small quarters together, random shallow conversations.
Title of movie is meaningless in context of pictured events, simply a made up ""catchy"" title.
Story premise, ""fighting for his freedom"", is false. 
Freedom from prison by fighting not a possibility in story, gets easy treatment and transfer/short sentence for being ""farang""/western. 
Freedom from drugs not shown in any way as a goal for the character.
Fighting for his life by being transferred to ""softer"" accommodations away from the gangs could be a purpose, but not sufficiently shown in movie and is attacked by gang anyway after transfer. 
Dads appearance seems made up and only put in to give the real Billy Moore a cameo. 
All in all great cinematography, shot in a style that gives you the feeling of being there, story is rubbish - waste of time.",negative
A Prayer Before Dawn,"A Prayer Before Dawn touches upon almost every grand subject of life. Love, lust, hate, deep anxiety and the willingness to survive. Even though he does is with minimal dialogue, Joe Cole's performance is one of the greatest I've ever seen. So raw. So full of energy and all different kinds of emotions. This film was a proper hit to the gut. Punt intended. Bravo.",positive
Stronger,"Jeff Bauman is an amazing and nice guy who went through the hell of losing both his legs in the Boston Marathon bombing of 2013, and became a huge inspiration to the people of this (Boston) area, the nation and the world. His book captured his experience with gratitude, a down to earth likable personality, and humor. None of those qualities made it into the movie, which unfortunately does him a huge disservice. The biggest problem is that virtually everyone in this pic is hugely unlikable. Hollywood also thinks that Lenny Clarke has to be in every Boston movie. There's no sense of the bigger story of the bombing and how the community truly rallied around the injured. Bauman moves back in with his alcoholic mother -- a second floor apartment, with stairs, with no modifications made for a double amputee -- and everybody goes on like nothing happened. Just not accurate. I understood that the point is that reality wasn't as inspirational as it seemed, but they depicted Bauman having an angry flashback/violent outburst when he appeared at the Bruins game to wave the flag just weeks after the bombing. Watch the video of the real event and see the pure joy on his face that boosted a whole city. It was lousy how they changed that. A few graphic scenes just not necessary. I also don't get why Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez was given a cameo when nobody else was, he was really out of place. The man who saved his life, Carlos Arredondo, is himself an amazing man and an inspirational activist who was portrayed as a sad sack whom Bauman had no desire to meet. This was also not true. On the whole I was disappointed by how ungrateful (or lazy!) Bauman was made to look, when gratitude and spirit came across so forcefully in the book. So I'm glad the movie is doing well, I'm glad people like it, and I hope it makes a lot of money. But read his book to get the real, much more amazing and inspiring story. Bauman will need financial support for the rest of his life.",negative
Stronger,"One of the pleasantries of frequenting movies in the theater : when you go in maybe expecting a decent Gyllenhall performance in what will probably be another sappy true life story and.... Its one of the best faakkin movies of the year (as a Bostonian would say)! David Gordon Green exceeds any expectations by pulling no punches, but at the same time crafting a tender and difficult love story (this could probably be on a double bill with the Big Sick, kind of the reverse side of that maybe). Also Tatiana Maslany shows why she will be around for a while (one hopes) post Orphan Black, and Clancy Brown reminds us why hes still a national treasure in about ten minutes of screen time (as Jeff Bauman's father).It's raw, it doesn't pull away, but the filmmaking has a perfect kind of dramatic (and at times surprisingly comedy) touch that never goes too far, never draws out tears like a manipulative bastard. It's wonderful in that encouraging sense that while Bauman helped to ultimately inspire those simply by, you know, not just not dying but that he didn't give up, this director, who might be unique among his peers as a kind of art-house journeyman if that makes sense, crafts another film loaded to the brim with deeply emotional performances that resonate because of Gyllenhall but also everyone else around him. This is a film rich with an atmosphere that is that Boston in certain movies (The Fighter is another) where it feels like you're there.Stronger is a case of a filmmaker and cast and entire production going beyond the lines of the usual by taking it down to the level of the basic, and yet it has and wrestles with truly existential problems: if one is still alive, perhaps by a little luck but also from the help of someone else, how do you cope with everyone calling you a hero when you feel like anything but? In other words, it shirks at phoniness, and carries the spirit of what I imagine is Bauman himself. Well well done!",positive
Gotti,"If Gotti were alive today he'd go after the whole cast and crew for making such a terrible film about him...this film had no structure, had nothing moving the film forward just parts of his live that are better in a documentary...I forced myself to watch the whole thing and was disappently the entire time...E from Entourage made a movie worse than Medellin if you know what I mean...I'd give this film -10 stars if I could",negative
Gotti,"The SAG cards of everyone involved in this movie should immediately be revoked. John Travolta should have tomaign a contract with moviegoers the world over that he will NEVER act in another movie. Ever.This movie was horrible - plain and simple. The storytelling was sloppy and disjointed. Travolta's portrayal of John Gotti was an embarrassment. If I were him, I'd be ashamed of that performance.John Gotti's story deserves Scorsese. It deserves DeNiro. It deserves actors and a director that knows the genre. It doesn't deserve John Travolta.",positive
The Man with the Iron Heart,"Good intentions. and a reasonable result. admirable job from Rosamunde Pike and Jason Clarke. and something missing. petr-varak review defines the basic problem - HHhH is a movie containing more two films more than two parts. the biography of Heydrich remains a sketch , correct but superficial, reminding a resume. and the second part seems be remind of ~Antropoid~, not a bad fact, useful to remind the events from Prague of 1943. but , having the same pieces and the same story and tools , it is difficult to ignore the similitudes, more inspired presented in the first film. remembering a docu-drama, it has the gift to be good start point for discover the life and the work of Reinhard Heydrich.",negative
The Man with the Iron Heart,"This film may not be perfect but its a solid effort and certainly of interest to those who have studied this period in history and the major players that shaped events as it were. Reinhard Heydrich was just such an individual and what this film does, where 'ANTHROPOID' among others failed, was to show Heydrich beyond just the heroism of the Czech resistance fighters who plotted to kill him for justifiable reasons. Heydrich was never really a political animal nor did he have any interest in the Nazis until his wife came along and convinced him to join. Had he not been cashiered from the Navy its quite likely history would've been written very differently and this movie shows us how these minor events led to the creation of a monster. My only complaint would be that it didn't tell us much about Heydrich's views towards Jews and his role in crafting the Final Solution, but other films like HBOs 'CONSPIRACY' will go along way towards shedding light on that question for interested viewers. The film's inherent weakness is trying to condense over 20 years of Heydrich's life into two hours while also explaining the plot that led to his assassination. That may have been a tall order for any director but at the same time this isn't a film meant for mass consumption. It's not a date movie nor a family affair but is only of interest to those who enjoy history. If you find the topic boring you'll undoubtedly give the movie a low rating but I think as far as this genre is concerned 'THE MAN WITH THE IRON HEART' is certainly a respectable entry in telling the story of one of history's greatest villains.",positive
Queen of Katwe,"This is exactly what you might expect from a true-life Disney sports movie about chess; good, but kinda basic. As someone who knows nothing about chess, the movie does the heavy-lifting so I could understand how to feel at each moment.

Queen of Katwe,Loved it well made and well acted. Teary in parts. It has been a while since a movie has had all the components of this movie. It captures how privileged we are in the west and out of pure will and following your passion you can come to be whom you really are against all odds.The actors portrayed the story with great depth and conviction. I loved the end and hope all true story's have the chance to show (Those that are still living) their real persons as I felt it adds a realness to the story and movie final. Well directed as well.There is a star in the making with actress Madina Nalwanga i am sure we will see allot more of her out standing performance.,positive
Holding the Man,"I really really liked this movie! It was a relentless and at times confronting experience, but proof positive that storytelling when it is steeped in such truth and such life experience, in the hands of brilliant storytellers results in exemplary cinema. Neil Armfield has long been a leading light in Australian theatre, and I had nearly forgotten his feature 'Candy' with Heath Ledger and Abbie Cornish, but was reminded of it, as I sat spellbound by the performances in 'Holding The Man' and its expert direction and attention to detail. Being in the audience for this movie, I felt safe in the hands of a master director. Ryan Corr, best known for the small screen like 'Packed to the Rafters' is a revelation; throwing himself head first into this leading role and intrepidly going where I suspect few actors might go. Craig Stott was a discovery for me, and although I struggled with some of the early scenes and wardrobe choices, his performance was realised as a truly moving and career making turn. Lots of great actors in supporting roles and cameos including the hilarious Kerry Walker in a blink and you'll miss it part. There's lots of humour, lots of pathos and lots of sexual activity which is thoughtfully and bravely brought to the screen. This is a must see experience, a story that needed to be told and has honoured the actor/writer Timothy Conigrave in so doing. Aussie filmmaking at its very finest.",negative
Holding the Man,"When you rate a film a 10, the review is harder because it usually means you are gushing with so much good news about the film, that you don't know where to begin.I'll just hit three points, and to be safe, I'M REPEATING MY SPOILER ALERT HERE. THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. 1. The casting is fantastic. The chemistry between Ryan and Craig is unlike anything I've ever seen in film, and I'm an oldie with an almost catalog knowledge of classic films. So, going back to the 1930s, I can't remember when I've seen two on-screen lovers who were more engaging and compelling. By the time the story ends, you feel like you gained and lost two great friends, so REAL is their relationship with each other. It translates over to a wonderful invitation to US, and we end up feeling lost when we lose them. (Yes, because this movie sticks with one well after one has seen it, I may be clouded by that glow, but, for now, that is my assessment of their chemistry.) 2. If you lived through the '80s and early '90s, as an adult, this film will resonate well and actually dredge up some horrifying memories of the time. If you have children in their 20s, it's even more oddly devastating to see (double spoiler alert here) two men being given a death sentence in their mid-twenties. (Triple spoiler alert here.) Although it takes years for the executioner to arrive, they are handed that death sentence at a very young age (25 - John; and 26 - Tim). To watch them have to cope with that as a couple, to see them thrown into such a nightmare at such a young age is tragic on an epic level. The day they get the bad news, they should be thinking about first jobs and maybe buying a car. It's astounding what they are instead handed. The grace with which they approach it is heartbreaking to watch.3. (Quadruple spoiler alert here.) Hearing Tim's voice at the end SLAYS. The constant stiff upper lip of both of their journeys is the thing that makes this film stick with you for hours or days after you see it. It's the dictionary definition of impressive. It impresses itself on you with its hard truths and horrid reality: Two people you grow to love leave you at the end of the film, and they do it bravely. It breaks your heart and leaves you with a strange longing.",positive
Woman in Gold,"During their occupation of Europe, the Nazis looted countless paintings. The paintings' rightful owners later spent years trying to reclaim them. A famous case was that of Maria Altmann, the daughter of a wealthy Jewish family in Vienna. Gustav Klimt painted a portrait of her aunt Adele, and the Nazis seized the painting after taking over Austria. Altmann's quest to reclaim the painting turned into a tug-of-war between the US and Austria in the late 1990s and early 2000s.Simon Curtis's ""Woman in Gold"" tells this story, starring Helen Mirren as Altmann and Ryan Reynolds as her lawyer. Part of what we see is how the lawyer - whose superiors at the law firm are REAL jerks - starts out isolated from his family history, but the trial reconnects him. I didn't even know about this story until the movie got released.Does the movie have any downside? Well, it's likely that Altmann's family made their wealth by paying slave wages, and the movie never addresses this. Of course, Hitler used the Jews' economic success to depict the Jews as money-grubbers, so this might not be the best place to address it.Overall, I recommend the movie. This is a part of history that no one should ever forget.",negative
Woman in Gold,"When I review a movie, I ask myself but one question: How entertaining is it? Of course, such a thing is always a matter of opinion and depends on an individual's personal background, personality, tastes, preferences, interests, experiences, and so forth. As a reviewer who likes all kinds of movies and hopes these reviews will be helpful to all kinds of moviegoers, I'm as objective and open-minded as I can be. Regardless of its genre, its subject matter or its background, all I expect from a movie is to enjoy it. This attitude allows me the freedom to like movies of any and all kinds, regardless of whether others think that I'm ""supposed"" to like them or not. Did the movie's comedy make me laugh, did its a drama draw me in and make me care, did its thrilling moments thrill me? Etc., etc. You get the point. I expect a film to entertain me – to make me FEEL something. But the best movies also inform, educate, enlighten and uplift. Oh, and bonus points for originality, creativity, and technical and artistic excellence. When you have the pleasure of seeing a film with all of those characteristics, it is a ""must see"". It is a treasure. It is art. ""Woman in Gold"" (PG-13, 1:49) is such a film.""Woman in Gold"" is based on the true story of Maria Altmann, who, as a young woman (played by Tatiana Maslany of ""Orphan Black"" fame) fled her beloved Austria as the Nazi noose was tightening around the necks of her Jewish countrymen. Encouraged by her family and with her new husband by her side, she left behind the people, places and possessions she loved. One of those possessions was a Gustav Klimt painting of her dear aunt Adele (Antje Traue), a painting which would soon be taken by the Nazis and, after World War II, end up in a Vienna art museum where it became so revered that one character calls it ""the Mona Lisa of Austria"".When Maria (played as an old woman by Dame Helen Mirren) loses her sister, she discovers some letters that, along with 1990s changes in Austrian law, make her think that she might reclaim what once belonged to her family. She enlists the help of Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds), a friend's son, to look into the matter for her. Randy is a young attorney who has just started a new job and whose wife (Katie Holmes) is concerned about the impact of a lengthy case on their growing family, but he becomes obsessed with Maria's cause. In Austria, Randy gains the assistance of a local journalist (Daniel Brühl), but this long and complicated bureaucratic and legal struggle may prove to be too much for any of them, or even all of them. If you ever start to think that this lengthy and emotionally taxing fight is merely about the extremely high value of the painting or even one woman's need for closure, you'll remember Maria ending a conversation about her motivations with ""and then there's justice."" ""Woman in Gold"" has something for everyone. It's an unusually dramatic history lesson, a riveting drama, an involving mystery, a fascinating legal thriller and a touching story of families and friendships. All members of the very talented cast bring their ""A game"", the writing is excellent and the editing is superb. All these factors come together in a narrative which transitions seamlessly between the story's present and its past, doing so as effectively as I've ever seen it done. The opening of the movie, a short scene involving the creation of the painting, effortlessly but effectively communicates how special the painting of the title really is. The film shows the plight of the Jews in Europe more personally than any film since ""Schindler's List"", but without being overwrought. It also sheds light on what it meant for a country to capitulate to the Nazis as well as the long-term effects of that chapter in history. Many scenes in the movie are dramatic and suspenseful, but the portion of the film in which Maria and her husband escape Austria is on par with the climactic scenes in Oscar-winning films like ""Argo"" and ""The Sound of Music"". Whichever genre or cubby hole that professional critics choose to place this movie in, it rises above most films to which it might be compared.Like a great painting, a great film is a joy and an honor to see for yourself. I hope that ""Woman in Gold"" is remembered when all those gold statuettes are handed out this next awards season. The worth of the movie is, in the end, only my opinion, but this film informed me, educated me, enlightened me, uplifted me, and, as a wonderful work of art, it entertained me. ""A+""",positive
Bleed for This,"I rated this movie as a 7, but I give it 8 for the first hour and 6 for the rest of the movie. The last hour could have had a better plot and focus more on the struggles of Pazienza. It is a good story of superation, mixed with some comedy and great performances by Miles Teller and Aaron Eckhart. For me the best part of the movie is the message that it is possible to overcome great challenges and get back to the top.",negative
Bleed for This,"This my first IMDb review after years of reading them, upon leaving the cinema though I thought this deserved it. Full marks for this movie, Miles Teller for his performance but most of all for Vinny Paz ( Pazienza ) who this biography is about. I saw this on a good size screen tonight with an enthusiastic audience, and we loved it. There were a lot of laughs throughout and a tension in the room, I really felt for this guy! Great performances from the whole cast and Miles Teller was on top form looking extremely buff. Nice to see Katey Segal looking fantastic as she always has . I wouldn't want to spoil this for anyone who hasn't seen it, although if you are a boxing fan you already know the story, just to say at the end of the film there was a round of applause, the Italians being the most vocal ha haI only wish there had been more ~ now I want to watch all this boxer's fightsRecommended!",positive
The Stanford Prison Experiment,"This film blew me away. I first saw it at the IFC Center in New York with an average expectation. The sound editing is the first thing you notice. It's crisp, clean, and wields its own power that is advantageous to the narrative. The narrative centers around the experiment that takes place at the Stanford University in the 70's. It follows the students who participate and how their lives immediately change for the worst. Now the film feels and looks like the era with great costumes and set work. Everything from the computers to the coffee mugs immerses you ever so deeper into the emotional toil that intensifies with each scene. A smart move I would like to mention from the casting directors is the fact they used actors from children's films and popular TV shows then start beating them up and messing with their characters' minds. For any millennial, they would instantly recognize the actors which gives the millennial a sense of familiarity with the characters, and at that sense feel more towards the behavior and mistreatment of those children actor's character. Overall, I was pleased with the film as it's theme and historical significance played in my mind throughout the whole day.",negative
The Stanford Prison Experiment,"The plot is based on a true story, blah blah blah. It's a good one as well! Not the amazing ingenious movie and certainly not the thriller that ""Das Experiment"" was... If you can find it at your local video store, go and get it and watch this instead! Don't get me wrong, the movie is a nice attempt, really interesting and raising all kinds of moral questions and dilemmas. The actors were true and professional all the way and overall, this is more than a movie for a pleasant afternoon... The science behind the experiment was kind of crappy, but I guess back then, psychologists were a bit on the rough side and not too cautious with experimental parameters, etc. Anyways, if you want the thrill and the tense, ""Das Experiment"" is what you should be looking for. This movie was unparalleled. Better yet, watch this one first and then ""Das Experiment""...",positive
Kill Your Darlings,"Well, how ironic that a film based on the giants of the Beat Generation, the literary revolution that cleaved the 20th Century in half, would collapse under the weight of a badly written, two dimensional, screenplay. There is no shortage of compelling story lines involving the writers who led this revolution; Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Lucien Carr, or William S. Burroughs (murdered his wife playing William Tell with a bow and arrow and got a way with it, oops).The storyline they chose was the murder committed by Lucien Carr where he stabbed and drown a former lover, David Kammerer. There should be plenty to work with here. But rather than focusing the 90 minutes of screen time on developing anything meaningful about the literary movement, the murder, the murderer, or the victim, we're instead shown snapshots of those things, plus Allen's mentally disturbed mother, Lucien's overly involved mother, a prank they commit at the library on the Columbia University campus, Jack Kerouac's complicated personal life, university stuff, other stuff, and then more stuff. The context in which this murder occurs, and the literary revolution, is everywhere, and nowhere. And in the end you could care less about any of them or what they did.I recall hearing a lot about this film while it was in production. The hype was intense because of the real life characters, what they did, and who was playing them. I do not recall the film ever being released. Perhaps it was. But it just seemed to disappear quietly and was forgotten. I saw something about it years later somewhere and thought to myself, ""Oh yeah, that. Wonder what happened to that film."" After purchasing the DVD and watching it, it is easy to see why it was smothered in its crib and buried in the backyard. Which is a shame because the story is there, some of the acting is quite good, but none of that can, or ever will, overcome bad writing. Which was kind of the point of the Beat Generation to begin with. If you can see it for free and have nothing better to do with 90 minutes of your life it won't kill you to watch it. It won't give you any enjoyment either.",negative
Kill Your Darlings,"I had the opportunity to see this movie at the Sundance film festival this year. Absolutely amazing. John Krokidas is a visionary. This is proof that there is an acting life for Daniel Radcliffe after Harry Potter. It is a thrilling and provocative must see. The film flows beautifully and keeps you entranced. This film pushes the limits to new depths that the industry is in desperate need of. I left the film feeling like my mind had been opened to a whole new level. I will watch this movie again and again. But keep in mind it is not for the faint of heart, it is very intense. If you want passion, betrayal, sex, drugs and as rock and roll as the 40's can get, this is your movie.",positive
Genius,"""Genius"" is the story of the great editor Maxwell Perkins and his relationship with Thomas Wolfe, author of Look Homeward Angel, You Can't Go Home Again, and other novels and stories.One thing before I start - the IMDb message board has to be the only place where people ADMIT they've never heard of Thomas Wolfe, much less read anything he wrote. I'm not sure I would be so forthcoming with that info. The cast is fantastic: Colin Firth as Perkins, Jude Law as Wolfe, Laura Linney as Mrs. Perkins, and Nicole Kidman as Aline Bernstein, who brings Wolfe's novel to Perkins in real life.Perkins is shown as a hard-working man, working with people like Fitzgerald and Hemingway and trying to balance his work with family, which consists of a wife and five daughters. He reads Wolfe's 300,000+ word novel and realizes the man is great genius - he also writes too many words. When he talks to Wolfe, he realizes why - he talks too many words, too. He's unmarried and having an affair with stage designer Aline Bernstein. It's a turbulent relationship that lasts around five years.His relationship with Perkins is turbulent too. At first Wolfe accepts Perkins' drastic cuts in his world; later on, he fights them. Nevertheless, Wolfe becomes a son to Perkins and Wolfe considers him his only friend.Jude Law and Nicole Kidman are unrecognizable in makeup, hair, and accent, and they both do terrific jobs. Law is a bombastic, exuberant, undisciplined Wolfe; Firth, who actually looks more like Thomas Wolfe than Law, is always excellent. Here he plays a restrained man who allows room for the temperaments of his various writers and attempts to be the voice of reason.Guy Pearce has a small role as F. Scott Fitzgerald. Something I read said he stole the movie. I love Guy Pearce, I would see him in anything (and have) but to me he wasn't Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald was a sweet-looking man, also a weak and drunken one, and Pearce did not portray that. Probably he did what the script and director dictated.I found this movie a good story that was not well-paced and on the talky side. I know today we're not used to movies with a lot of dialogue, but there's always room for sharp, witty dialogue as in ""All About Eve,"" for instance. This didn't have enough of that kind of writing and became tedious and sagged in spots.The end of the film is very touching. I recommend seeing this for the performances.",negative
Genius,"""O lost, and by the wind grieved, ghost, come back again."" ― Thomas Wolfe, Look Homeward, AngelMax Perkins (Colin Firth) was the genius Scribner's magazine editor, who helped Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Wolfe become iconic American writers. The watchable Genius, directed by Michael Grandage with a sure understanding of drama, is mostly Thomas Wolfe's (Jude Law) story. The taciturn Max provides the necessary guidance to make sure the book belongs to the writer while Max delivers ""good books into the hands of readers.""Although the film is engrossingly placed in Perkin's pv, Wolfe dominates through his exuberant personality and unending energy. While Firth plays Perkins as the conservative but imaginative editor, Law is the reason to see the film, a brilliant acting turn reminiscent of his over-the-top Dom Hemingway. Law simply has never been better than as Wolfe.The sepia look of the film is appropriate to the 1929 setting of NYC, and Nicole Kidman as his other muse, Aline Bernstein, is memorably smart and vulnerable when it comes to dealing with manic Wolfe. Although Laura Linney as Louise Perkins is lost in spotty, low energy appearances, her general good cheer carries nicely for a Perkins of whom the audience has grown fond.Because I am always seeking a biography that will show the creative labors of artists, Genius satisfies me when Perkins and Wolfe struggle over the manuscripts. After experiencing Genius, I have seen two sterling examples.",positive
Victoria & Abdul,"This is a biopic about the great great grandmother of our present Queen (""The Queen"" as far as Stephen Frears's earlier film starring Helen Mirren is concerned). It also features her great grandfather Edward VII, another real and in many ways important historical figure shown in such a non-positive light that it must be seen as a profoundly wrong and impertinent portrayal (unless what is shown here is really true, which seems far from plausible to the casual viewer).In fact, this film begins by declaring it is ""mostly"" telling a true story - in the context of a kind of jokey presentation style that scarcely inspires confidence. Indeed, at no time does this BBC offering directed by Frears really seek to inspire said confidence. Rather, it is cynically happy to spend half its time one step away from farce (albeit pointed and cruel farce), while parasitising on the well-known capacity of Dame Judi Dench to add gravitas and class to any role she takes on. This is indeed the case as Dench takes the heroine of our story through to her very deathbed of 1901, and to that epoch-making moment in the constant company of her real-life steadfast companion and Munshi (teacher) from Agra, Abdul Karim.Now this is clearly an amazing story, and - to be fair - Frears at no time strays from the remarkable truth that Victoria was truly a non-racist in an era of unthinking racism. Dench's portrayal of Her Majesty makes her a sympathetic and wise figure, even if she does get to utter a number of implausible-looking lines about how fed up of being Queen she really is, how lonely, how disappointed in her family, and indeed how self-loathing. Ali Fazal is the Moslem Karim, who comes to the rescue of his Empress, endlessly loyal, though also it seems plagued mercilessly by a sexually-transmitted disease! Does Her Majesty fancy him anyway, or is she just touched by his devotion and capacity to cut through the protocol to show real feeling? No stone is left unturned in this area, but it all remains pretty decorous and at times touching.In contrast, Frears has little mercy for the royal households at Windsor and the gorgeous Osborne House (Isle of Wight), or indeed for the aforementioned ""Bertie"" (the future Edward VII). The latter is portrayed very convincingly by Eddie Izzard in terms of looks, but far-from-plausibly in what the character says and does. When he meets Karim's fellow Indian servant, who has failed to make the same meteoric rise his colleague has managed and is now near death due to TB, he gets to hear an embittered and angry diatribe against the British Empire (you can just feel how much Frears loves every minute of that), before promising the would-be rebel that he is not going to make it out of the place alive! Did the future King really investigate such matters himself? Might he really be so angry and merciless and devious?Background reading makes it clear that a (surprisingly) great deal of what is shown in the film DID INDEED actually happen, or at least is very much in the spirit of what happened, so YET AGAIN we are left with a biopic showing real people doing (some) real things that very often fails to convince. And in this case quite a lot of the blame must be laid with Director Frears. Just for starters, he should follow the basic rule that - if one really insists on simplifying centuries of Empire involving countless millions of people down to a single cliché word or concept - it is necessary to choose between ""evil"" and ""ridiculous"" and not try hopelessly to suggest both at the same time! Likewise, comedy is comedy, farce is farce and a historical film is a historical film. Films do in fact have genres for a reason.As usual, a piece of this kind inspires a huge desire to read up further on its subject matter - which can only be a good thing. But it is also absurd in many ways that more pleasure and insight is gained from the reading than from the film inspiring that response in the first place! That said, Dame Judi really can do no wrong to my mind, and she does indeed achieve a pretty compelling portrayal of a monarch only now being revealed, not as a one-dimensional figure, but as someone who can be a genuine source of wonder in all her multi-stranded diversity. Perhaps that is reason enough to give ""Victoria and Abdul"" a watch, for all its imperfections?",negative
Victoria & Abdul,"As we crawl out of the (largely disappointing) summer movie season, the first of the serious award-contenders hoves into view. Victoria and Abdul tells the untold story of a hushed-up relationship between an aged Queen Victoria (Judi Dench, ""Philomina"", ""Spectre"") and her Indian servant, Abdul Kareem (Ali Fazal). Kareem is shipped to England from Agra to deliver a ceremonial coin to the Queen on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee, together with a grumbling 'stand-in tall guy' Mohammed (Adeel Akhtar, ""The Big Sick"", ""Four Lions""). Kareem finds the Queen as sour, depressed and acidic as her post-Albert reputation would have you imagine. But something clicks between the two, and pretty soon the perked-up queen is learning Urdu and all about the Koran, much to the horror of her successor Teddy, the Prince of Wales (a splendid Eddie Izzard, ""Oceans 13"") and the rest of the royal household, who try desperate measures to derail the relationship. This film is a complete delight. I went along without great expectations.... a worthy film I thought I should go and see to write a worthy review about. But I was entranced from beginning to end. It's probably best described as a comedy drama... always a difficult trick for a movie-maker to pull off. But here in the competent hands of director Stephen Frears (""Florence Foster Jenkins"") the comedy is both very, VERY funny, with the drama also being extremely moving. And crucially the transition between the two never feels forced. I've seen a few critical comments that the film's underlying topic - the subjugation of the Indian state and the queen's role in that, is a ""serious topic"" and not a suitable subject for a comedy like this. And of course, ""the Empire"" is a terrible legacy that the British people have around their necks in the same manner as Germans have their Nazi past and the American South have their history of slavery. But the film never really gets into these issues in any depth: Abdul's background, whilst sketchily drawn and feeling rather sanitised for the late 1800's, is one of a middle-class Indian with a decent colonial job: someone shown respect by his British managers. While the ""uprising"" of Muslims is mentioned - indeed it's a key part of the story - Victoria's lack of knowledge of such things, or indeed of all things to do with the country she is 'Empress' of, is made clear. The focus of the film is quite rightly on the understandable scandal (for the day) of the queen of England (and hence head of the Church of England) having a spiritual teacher (or ""Munshi"") who is neither white nor Christian. If there is a criticism to be made of the splendid script by Lee Hall (""War Horse"") it is that the racial references - and there are a few - feel rather over-sanitised given the tensions that erupt as the story unfolds. Above all, this is an acting tour de force for Dame Judi, reprising her role as the elderly queen from ""Mrs Brown"" which (shockingly!) is now 20 years old. I know its early in the season to be placing bets, before having seen any of the other major contenders, but Dench's ""insanity"" speech screams ""Oscar reel"" to me. Her performance is masterly from beginning to end. Rather overshadowed by Dench is the relative newcomer to western cinema Ali Fazal (he had a role in the ""Furious 7"" film). But his performance is almost as impressive, bringing the warmth and compassion to the supporting role that is so sorely needed if the overall balance of the film is to be maintained. The supporting cast is equally stellar with Olivia Williams (""An Education"", ""The Sixth Sense"") acidic as Baroness Churchill; Simon Callow (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"") as Puccini; Michael Gambon (""Harry Potter"") as Lord Salisbury and Tim Pigott-Smith as Henry Ponsonby, head of the royal household. This was Pigott-Smith's final live-action performance before his untimely death at the age of only 70 in April of this year: and it's sad to say that he really doesn't look well in this film. Also of note is Fenella Woolgar as lady's maid Miss Phipps, comical as a the quivering wreck holding the shortest straw in having to face up to her ferocious mistress.Another star of the show is the Scottish countryside, ravishingly photographed by Danny Cohen (""Florence Foster Jenkins"", ""Room"") with this film probably doing more for the Scottish Tourist Board than any paid for advertising could ever do!As the film comments it's ""Based on a True Story... Mostly"", and this tease of a caption both infuriates and intrigues in equal measure.  I may feel obliged to delve into the original source material by Shrabani Basu to learn more.  Overall this is a true delight of a film, perfectly balanced, brilliantly acted: I would say this is a ""must see"" for any older viewers over the age of 50 in need of a cinema outing that doesn't disappoint. This is everything that (for me) ""Viceroy's House"" should have been but wasn't. Highly recommended. (For the graphical version of this review, please visit www.bob-the- movie-man.com.

Florence Foster Jenkins,"Sometimes true love/friendship just tells the truth. I felt so sorry for Florence, ill with syphilis, probably tone deaf to her excruciating singing and so ""protected"" by her faithless husband and others in her generous employ, that she ended up making an utter fool of herself. How cruel to have to find out the truth at the scathing hands of the Post critic. I can't help but compare this ""based on actual events"" story with recent similarly true releases; Lion, A United Kingdom, Queen of Katwe, all worth spending the dollars and time to bring to the screen and a wider audience. I see this production as just creating a wider audience to laugh at Florence, not matter how you dress it up as her joy of life etc people are YouTubing to laugh at her horrendous recordings. My take home message from this: be kind, gentle etc but tell the truth, it's so much kinder in the long run.",negative
Florence Foster Jenkins,"Florence Foster Jenkins, to put it mildly, was a notoriously inept singer, often screeching her way through songs (a prime example being Queen of the Night's ""Der Halle Rache"") with no ear for intonation, tone, meaning of song/text or rhythm.It must not have been easy making Foster Jenkins somebody interesting or relatable, but 'Florence Foster Jenkins' manages to do so brilliantly. 'Florence Foster Jenkins' also does a much better job than most biopics to sticking close to the facts, having regard for historical accuracy, not leaving things rose-tinted and not having characters that are basically come and go vignettes.Admittedly, some characters are more developed and interesting than others and some have little screen time. However, this didn't come over as a huge problem in 'Florence Foster Jenkins' because everything else was so successful. The 40s period detail is evocative, sumptuous and extremely beautiful to look at, and the film is exquisitely photographed and tightly edited.The music is magnificent, with a score from Alexandre Desplat that fits superbly and sounds great on its own, Desplat's distinctively hypnotic style immediately recognisable. Also striking was how 'Florence Foster Jenkins' combined humour and pathos, it does so perfectly and both elements are brilliantly executed. The comedy is genuinely hilarious and the pathos masterfully moving. The direction does really well in making a potentially dull story dramatically engaging, warm and uplifting, one also admires Foster Jenkins' determination.Best of all is the acting. Meryl Streep's performance in the title role is a triumph, making her a compellingly real character and succeeds in intentionally singing badly despite that in real life Streep is a far better singer (almost anybody is, well apart from the TV talent show rejects). Hugh Grant's performance here is one of his best, perhaps his best since 'About a Boy' and he has rarely been more nuanced or sympathetic in a role very much removed from his usual romantic-comedy roles. Simon Helberg's supporting turn is spot-on, instead of being annoying or too effeminate Helberg is hilarious, suitably camp and loyal.Rebecca Ferguson similarly excels, David Haig relishes his deliciously shady and not too pantomimic role and Nina Arianda brings charm to a potentially shallow and irritating character. These roles are difficult to pull off but they are pulled off quite adeptly.In summary, entirely captivating. 10/10 Bethany Cox",positive
A Private War,"Greetings again from the darkness. Marie Colvin was a (seemingly) fearless war correspondent obsessed with giving a voice to those forgotten during war. Were she alive today, she could not have hand-picked a better filmmaker than Matthew Heineman to tell her story. Director Heineman was Oscar nominated for CARTEL LAND (2014) and, combined with his CITY OF GHOSTS (2017), gives him two of the best ever documentaries that show what the front lines are like in both international wars and the equally dangerous wars being fought over drug territories. Heineman has carried his own camera directly into the center of those storms, while Ms. Colvin took her pen and pad. Simpatico.Based on Marie Brenner's Vanity Fair article ""Marie Colvin's Private War"" (screenplay by Arash Amel), the film benefits from the extraordinary and courageous work of Ms. Colvin, and also a terrific performance from Rosamund Pike (words I've not previously written). Ms. Pike captures the extremes of Ms. Colvin's life - the atrocities of war and the self-prescribed treatment of her PTSD through vodka, and does so in a manner that always seems believable. She lets us in to a world most of us can't imagine.As a war correspondent for Britain's Sunday Times (since 1986), Ms. Colvin told the stories we'd rather not know. In her words, ""I saw it, so you don't have to."" The film begins with a stunning overhead view of 2012 war-ravaged Homs Syria (destruction courtesy of Assad's soldiers) - a place that starts the film and later ends the story. We then flash back to 2001 London so we can witness Marie in society and struggling with a personal relationship. She then chooses, against her editor's (Tom Hollander) guidance to cover Sri Lanka. It's a decision that cost her an eye, while also providing her recognition as the eye-patch wearing female war reporter.In 2003, a tip takes her to a previously undiscovered mass grave site in Fallujah. This is her first work alongside photographer Paul Conroy (played by Jamie Dornan). Having ""seen more war than most soldiers"", Ms. Colvin's severe alcoholism can't kill the nightmares, visions, and PTSD. After time in a clinic, she returns to work. We see her in 2009 Afghanistan and then pulling no punches when interviewing Libya's Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. During these assignments, we learn much about Ms. Colvin's personality and approach. She is rarely without a cigarette, admits to wearing Le Perla lingerie (and why), carries Martha Gellhorn's ""The Face of War"" as her field manual, and wins two British Foreign Journalist of the Year awards - though seeing her at the banquets is quite surreal.Hollander's subtle performance as news editor Sean Ryan is also quite impressive. He fears for her safety (and even questions her sanity) but is in constant conflict with the need to sell newspapers - something Ms. Colvin's stories certainly did. Stanley Tucci has a role as Tony Shaw, her love interest, but despite her words, we never believe he and his sailboat are ever more than a distraction from her obsession with the front lines. The final sequence in 2012 Homs Syria is stunning, as is her final interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN.Ms. Pike has altered her voice to mimic the deeper tone of Marie Colvin - her efforts confirmed in the final interview played at the film's end. It's quite a career boost for Ms. Pike, who has previously been known for playing ice queens in films like GONE GIRL. She captures the traumatized Marie, but also the obsession of someone whose DNA constantly drove her back to the stories that needed to be told.Director Heineman's unique perspective combined with the cinematography of 3 time Oscar winner Robert Richardson (a favorite of Scorcese, Tarantino, and Oliver Stone) delivers a realism of war that we rarely see on screen. Mr. Richardson also shot SALVADOR (1986) and PLATOON (1986) and his work here surpasses both. The film gives us a glimpse at the psychological effects of such reporting, and a feel for the constant stress of being surrounded by tragedy and danger. This is fitting tribute to a courageous and very skilled woman, although I do wish the men weren't constantly helping her out of trucks and jeeps.",negative

Battle of the Sexes,"I don't think so. This is typical of Hollywood these days, everything is seen through the lens of ""social justice"". This leads to historical revisionism. Along these lines, this film really misses the point. This was never intended to be a competitive tennis match, it was tennis exhibition that was practically staged. This included all the pre-match hype. All the drama surrounding the event was manufactured.Yes, the goal of the promoters was to grow women's tennis into a spectator sport in the television age, but it was also to grow the sport of tennis in general. This exhibition was a grand success for the sport, ratings went up across the board.This was the legacy of the 1972 exhibition. As far as the film goes, this message is muddled by all sorts of incidental nonsense and heavy handed political correctness.The cast is a mixed bag, Steve Carell is, once again outstanding. He is our finest comedic actor. Emma Stone as BJK is a flat out miscast. Her appearance and energy was way off.This was an opportunity for a quality cinematic treatment of a sport and cultural event that defined the times. Unfortunately , the legacy of this film will be in the trash bin of the dreary 2010s, a decade when art gave way to political correctness, identity politics and social ""justice"".",negative
Battle of the Sexes,"Here's a good test of someone's age.... ask the question ""Billie-Jean?"". Millennials will probably come back with ""Huh?""; those in their 30's or 40's might come back with ""Michael Jackson!""; those older than that will probably reply ""King!"".""Battle of the Sexes"" tells the true-life story of US tennis star Billie-Jean King (Emma Stone, ""La La Land""). The year is 1973 and Billie-Jean is riding high as the Number 1 female tennis player. She is a feminist; she is married (to hunk Larry - no not that one - King played by Austin Stowell (""Whiplash"", ""Bridge of Spies"")); ... and she is also attracted to women, not something she has yet acted on. That all changes when her path crosses with LA-hairdresser Marilyn (Andrea Riseborough, ""Birdman"", ""Oblivion"").But this is a side story: the main event is a bet made by aging ex-star Bobby Riggs (Steve Carell, ""Foxcatcher""); that - even at his age - as a man he could beat the leading female tennis player of the day.The film is gloriously retro, starting with the old-school 20th Century Fox production logo. And it contains breathtakingly sexist dialogue by writer Simon Beaufoy (""Everest"", ""The Full Monty""). Surely men couldn't have been so crass and outrageous in the 70's? Sorry ladies, but the answer is yes, and the film is testament to how far women's rights have come in 50 years. This is a tour de force in acting from both Emma Stone and Steve Carell, particularly the latter: a scene where Carell tries to re-engage with his estranged wife (Elisabeth Shue, ""Leaving Las Vegas"") is both nuanced and heart-breaking. Stone's performance is also praiseworthy, although it feels slightly less so as it is an impersonation of a (relatively) well-known figure: this is extremely well-studied though, right down to her strutting walk around the court which I had both forgotten and was immediately again reminded of. One of my favourite movie awards are the Screen Actor's Guild (SAG) ""cast"" awards that celebrate ensemble performances, and here is a film that should have been nominated (it unfortunately wasn't). Andrea Riseborough; Natalie Morales (as fellow tennis player Rosie Casals); comedian Sarah Silverman (""A Million Ways to Die in the West""), almost unrecognisable as the brash publicist Gladys Heldman; Bill Pullman as LTA head Jack Kramer; the great Alan Cumming (""The Good Wife"") as the team's flamboyant, gay, costume designer; Lewis Pullman as Riggs's son Larry; Jessica McNamee (magnetic eyes!) as King's Australian tennis nemesis Margaret Court. All bounce off the leads, and each other, just beautifully.Cinematography by Linus Sandgren (""La La Land"") and editing by Pamela Martin (""Little Miss Sunshine"") unite to deliver one of the most sexually charged haircuts you are ever likely to see on the screen. For those put off by this aspect of the storyline, the ""girl-on-girl action"" is pretty tastefully done and not overly graphic: it's mostly ""first-base"" stuff rather than ""third-base""!Directed with panache by the co-directors of the 2006 smash ""Little Miss Sunshine"" - Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris - all in all it's a delight, especially for older audiences who will get a blast of nostalgia from days when sports were still played at a slightly more leisurely pace... and definitely without the grunting.(For the graphical review please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or One Mann's Movies on Facebook.

Whiskey Tango Foxtrot,"This movie is totally worth a prime-time ticket and a big popcorn. Then get the DVD to show it to friends. No scenery/FX worth a BluRay. Some folks question changing the excellent title of the book on which it is based to: WHISKEY, TANGO, FOXTROT. That phrase may not be as well known as what it translates to (""What The Fsck,"") but wondering-then-figuring-it-out does get attention. The sales cycle Attention/Interest/Desire/Action is thus well served.I suspect that ""Foxtrot/Fsck"" in a movie title with Margot Robbie's character admitting she knows she's a ""15"" in AfPak and then ""usin' it"" in the trailers, sets an expectation that we'll see at least as much of her as we did in say, ""The Big Short"" or ""Wolf of Wallstreet"" and that sells tickets. Ms. Robbie has a lot of well deserved ""body confidence,"" which by itself did not sell me a ticket - but it didn't hurt either.Co-Producer Fey wants to tell tickets, yes, but she has told us a story and she wants us to see it. A 5-star business decision, say I. The movie shows what happens when you mix a stone-age culture with modern weapons from the POV of a New York Girl/Journalist. Neither book or movie have suggestions on what to do about AfPac. It does however help us understand what ""The Graveyard of Empires"" is all about.",negative
Whiskey Tango Foxtrot,"I am impressed. This is one of the few films which has inspired me to read the source material; the autobiography by the journalist Kim Baker..The film starts with comic moments as greenhorn middle-America Kim Baker (Tina Fey) arrives in a war zone. Then, the film darkens as it touches on the corruption of the expatriate community and the seduction of war reporting.Surprisingly, Tina Fey can act in a dramatic role. Being comic with a straight face, facing danger, fending off romeos, and falling in love. In the end, Kim Baker rediscovers herself and returns home.The film deals superficially with the horror faced by Afghan civilians and the root causes of the insurgency. However, this is the story of a white woman in a foreign land.Overall, the film was predictable but lightly touches the soul. Credit to the editor for walking the difficult line between entertainment and horror. The rest of the cast did a creditable job.",positive
All Eyez on Me,"This was the greatest blunder and disappointment in movie history.I don't want to get into the specifics of why the movie was bad. Just know that the scenes were choppy and didn't flow together, the story line was off, and it was widely inaccurate. Notorious seemed like a hit movie compared to this. One of the most saddest parts of this film, was the complete way they ignored his paranoid and prophetic part of Tupac. One of Tupac's defining traits toward the end of his life was his constant foreshadowing of his own death and his paranoia during his daily life. Songs like 'Only Fear of Death' and 'So Many Tears' are evident of this. He would rap about being reincarnated, coming back a ghost, and his funeral being empty. He would talk about being killed in his sleep and his complete distrust of all the people around him. This part was completely and utterly not discussed in this movie whatsoever and removes the most interesting part of Tupac out of the picture. That God inducing and and death side of him is what has immortalized him to this day to a prophetic level and it is not even mentioned in the movie.This movie has completely failed and this needs to be done over in another movie or perhaps a series.I would give it a one out of ten. Do not even go to the movies to support this motion picture.",negative
All Eyez on Me,"I just got done watching this movie on HBO and it had my attention through the entire thing. It was engaging, well acted and produced. I guess my expectations were not as high as other reviewers. I didn't expect angels to sing and have Tupac delivered unto me by Charlton Heston-like narration. I expected a biopic about a talented young artist who had a lot to offer who was killed when he was way too young. That's what this movie is about. The movie doesn't romanticize Tupac and the lead actor looks and acts so much like him it's eerie. They show Tupac was in part responsible for sowing the seeds of his own death. I remember that time and there was an incredible amount of anger and hate in Rap music, the East Coast vs West Coast rivalry and with the gangs. When Tupac was killed a lot of people thought, well, that's the thug life. This movie shows that Tupac, despite his prison stay and public posturing, wasn't really about that life at all. He was an artist, who had incredible talent, sensitivity and range. This movie captures that. I liked the movie and will watch it again. As for the haters I really don't know what they were expecting.",positive
Loving Vincent,"From the very first moments of the movie the way it looked hooked me up instantly. The transition between scenes were masterful in the opening part and Clint Mansell's wonderful score sent shivers down my spine.
Loving Vincent tells the story of the artist's death through flashbacks and an unplanned investigation a man found himself doing. The story is maybe not the star of the show, or the reason this movie gets hyped, but that does not make it anything less than brilliant, it is a very well told story, it was very moving and emotional. I literally heard some of the crowd in the theater sobbing by the end of it.
I absolutely loved the voice acting. And I don't think I really have to mention how brilliant the animation is, if you just watched the trailer you will know how is this thing because the looks of it can not be described.
To me this movie is a late appreciation of Van Gogh and his art that he has not seen in his life, and will forever be one of my all time favorites.",negative
Loving Vincent,"Absolutely beautiful, a total sensory experience! Over the years I have seen various movies about Vincent and read about his close relationship with his brother Theo. What I found amazing about this movie was the imaginative approach that was taken to unravel his life and work. So many details were revealed that I had no idea of, and put into such interesting context. The choice of actors was brilliant and we see how close they resemble the actual people during the credit roll at the end of the film - also highly imaginative. I love the rich colours, the Cerulean blue and bright yellows. Truly a starry night! Don't miss.",positive
The Tale,"This film did a wonderful job depicting what it's like to uncover childhood trauma as an adult. I love how she went back and forth between child and adult, starting with an idyllic memory and slowly realizing her prior understanding of her experience was faulty. I also loved how she occasionally asked the younger versions of people in her memory questions as an adult, holding a make-believe dialogue. Connection to her younger self was made clear in this film, an important aspect when considering childhood memories - distant but deeply felt. What an honest, artistic expression of one woman's experience with childhood trauma. Very (painfully but satisfactorily) relatable for people with a similar history.",negative
The Tale,"This is one of the most honest, disturbing yet beautiful explorations of a subject that is all too often over-simplified or dealt with extremely heavy-handily.The way that the abuse is discussed within the characters frozen in time in the main character's psyche, is profound and unflinchingly honest. The discussions in real-life between mother and daughter - painfully real.I will be thinking about this film for some time to come, it is an invitation to look much more closely at the stories we tell ourselves, especially with regards to ""love"".",positive

Anyone who says it wasn't necessary for making, it was. It's based off the book brain on fire: my month of madness. She was the 217th person ever to be diagnosed with this. We need more awareness.

The Front Runner,"Forget the seemingly stellar cast. You can't even hear them. I'm giving up on movies that don't meet the most basic technical criteria, i.e. decent sound that doesn't drown out all dialogues and actors who actually open their mouth when talking. The Frontrunner manages to deprive the viewer of both. It is the audio equivalent of the shakycam from ten years ago (like the 2nd and 3rd Jason Bourne movie): annoying and self destructive. Thanks but no thanks. Time is too precious to be wasted on films like this.",negative
The Front Runner,"When I checked out the reviews for THE FRONT RUNNER after walking out of the theater, I was surprised to find that it was being met with a generally mixed critical reception. That's not to say that THE FRONT RUNNER is some sort of masterpiece, but I definitely thought it was an interesting film, and one that feels rather timely in this day and age (for reasons that are quite obvious). Perhaps the best thing I can say about the film is that it manages to avoid the on-the-nose writing that plagued BLACKKKLANSMAN in more than a few scenes. Reitman smartly lets the film speak for itself, letting the audience draw their own connection between the events that torpedoed Senator Gary Hart's campaign over thirty years ago and similar events that have plagued other politicians over the last few years. If there's one consequence to such an approach, it's that Reitman presents a lot of ideas without ever taking a firm stand on them, failing to elaborate on ideas that almost demand further analysis - an approach that will certainly rub some the wrong way. That being said, there's a lot to enjoy here, from Hugh Jackman's great performance to Jason Reitman's directing (I quite liked the way he utilized the camera here) to Rob Simonsen's low-key electronic score to the rest of the supporting cast (with an affecting Vera Farmiga being the obvious standout). It even reminded me of a bit of I, TONYA in its analysis of the press (how would American history have been affected if not for their obsession over Hart's love life?).One more thing, though: it might have just been the theater I watched this in, but the sound mixing in this was atrocious. I want to watch this film again with subtitles just so that I can understand the other half of what the characters were saying.",positive
Masterminds,"The story line has great potential but it is not executed very well. Filming was well done but the acting is overdone. Location is varied but even in Mexico they depict all the actors as bubbling idiots The film depicts everyone as of low intelligence, the bad guys the FBI etc. Humour is stupid, more slapstick and in poor sexual taste than funny. Watching this film I felt that it was an insult to my intelligence. Zach Galifianakis's makeup was not realistic and with his southern accent it came across as very false. I'm not sure why southerners have to be depicted all the time as dumb. Owen Wilson was his usual boring self, same role he plays in all movies. If this had been produced with the some class it could have been very interest",negative
Masterminds,"I have watched 1000s of movies in recent years. I have not reviewed a single one. I had to review this title. I was shocked that this movie generated a 5.7 average. I have not laughed so hard in ages. It is not a super-smart type of humor, but gets the job done. If you're not super uptight you will love this movie. Truly a gem in the comedy genre as I have stopped watching comedies due to the stupidity of the humor. Here, it's not overdone. While sometimes childish, still executed with taste. Being based on a true story is what initially sold the movie; however, I believe the real heist was just an inspiration for the movie. Therefore, do not expect a true story feel to this movie, just a laugh out loud comedy.",positive
Pride,"Probably few things have divided the British people more in the last forty years than Margaret Thatcher's time as Conservative leader. The pivot point for that hatred/worship was the protracted dispute with the National Union of Mineworkers in 1984/85. Arthur Scargill led the miners in a fight to the death against pit closures and their way of life; Maggie Thatcher led the government and establishment that could never afford to lose that battle. Britain would have been a very very different place if history's dice had fallen differently.It would make a great movie. But ""Pride"" isn't it.Whilst based on a surprising true story and whilst the politics of the strike forms the backdrop to the story, politics itself doesn't really rear its head in the film (other than the rather one-sided perspective of the miners that they were 'right' and the Thatcher and police in general were 'evil'). Instead, this is really a study of the enormous prejudice and real physical danger faced by the gay and lesbian community in London and the country in general.George MacKay (""Sunshine on Leith"") plays ""Bromley"" (real name Joe) – a 20-year old (so therefore under-age at the time) who is a closet gay. He lives a normal suburban middle-class life with his unsuspecting parents whilst also supporting the LGSM ('Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners') action group. This is led by Mark Ashton (Ben Schnetzer, ""The Book Thief""), who drives forward the goal of raising financial aid for the striking miners' families. Helping him are his assorted friends including gay couple Jonathan and Gethin (Dominic West and the brilliant Andrew – ""Moriaty"" – Scott), Mike (Joseph Gilgun), Jeff (Freddie Fox) and Steph (Faye Marsay ""I'm the 'L' in LGSM!"").The irony is that the miners are generally speaking the most homophobic group that they could ever hope to find, so the union wants nothing to do with them or their money. Through necessity, the group focuses on one small Welsh village and on turning the community (their attitude that is!) to accept them and their gifts. Even this reduced scope proves to be an uphill struggle.Whilst this is first and foremost a 'comedy drama', a menacing presence in the film is the AIDS virus: this was a time before retroviruses, when being diagnosed HIV-positive was a short and dark path to the graveside. Yet at a time when thousands were dying of the disease, Jonathan has the alternative moniker of ""Number 2"" – the second person in the country to be diagnosed as HIV-positive but mysteriously still alive.The film is a tour de force of British acting talent. In particular (give or take the odd dodgy accent) the characters who make up the Welsh community are all superb: Paddy Considine (""Hot Fuzz"", ""The Bourne Ultimatum"") plays the open and reasonable envoy first sent to London to meet LGSM; Bill Nighy in a quiet and understated performance (yes, you heard me right) plays Cliff; Imelda Staunton plays the hilarious role of Hefina, leader of the committee group; Jessica Gunning is pitch-perfect as Sian – a tea lady with a feisty attitude and Maureen (Lisa Palfrey) is a delightfully unlikable homophobic miner's wife who stokes trouble with contemptuous glee. Finally, a good share of the comic lines go to the marvelous Menna Trussler as the bespectacled old dear Gwen.Both MacKay and Schnetzer head up the younger end of the cast admirably: I was very rude about Schnetzer's performance in my ""Book Thief"" review, but he is a revelation in this film. Andrew Scott is as magnetic as always, and Dominic West shines as the nearest to Simon Callow's memorable ""Four Wedding's"" character that we've seen, swapping ""Bloody Brigadoon"" Scottish dancing for lively disco-led moves.Matthew Warchus, better known as a Broadway director and a relative stranger to the film set, directs with verve and style. The comic timing delivered through the final edit is very sharp. And the pathos and tragedy is handled very sensitively but very powerfully: there were a number of ladies in the cinema I saw who were in floods of tears when the lights came up. (Also, as a further warning for tissue supplies to take into the cinema, if like me you have a Welsh other half then the combination of panoramic Welsh landscapes and (very moving) close harmony singing will trigger severe homeland-sickness: you can take the girl out of Wales, but ).This film came close to perfect. But I had a few issues with the (generally excellent) script by Stephen Beresford. The reason for Mark's dramatic change of heart in the middle of the film was rather poorly explained (if explained at all). And was it me or did one of Maureen's rabidly homophobic sons do a U-turn in appearing with the other miners at the (remarkably, historically correct) gay pride march at the end of the film? If so, this seems to be an unnecessary and Hollywood-style candy-coating too far.Above all, for me this is a film that both highlights how far we have come in thirty years in the area of gay rights and perhaps how far there still is to go. As a particularly touching example, seeing how difficult it was for the teenage Joe to come out to his parents in 1985 made me realise it is probably almost as hard today as it was then. Whilst levels of both expectation and acceptance are higher today, it is still a hard conversation to have ""Perhaps you'd like me to take you to the cinema to see a film Mum and Dad?"".(If you enjoyed this review, please see my other reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and sign up to ""Follow the Fad"".

Pride,"I have just watched this film and on a personal level it affected me greatly. I was a young gay man in 1984 and I and friends, travelled to both the 84 and 85 Pride marches in London. I remember the Miners support at the 85 and we were greatly touched at the time. The movie got the details exactly right, I and many of my gay friends were on lots of marches including the ones against Clause 28 the evil Tory piece of legislation that outlawed promotion of homosexuality in schools and publicly funded museums and art gallerias (among others).What I want to say about this film is that young gay and straight people should see it. It is immensely moving and funny. Just the right balance. I wept throughout and laughed because it brought to life my youth as I lived it in protest against that evil woman and her kind who dared to tell us how to live our lives, and who we couldn't legally love. It was scary times, AIDS, homophobia and arrest for protest.I probably can't be objective because of my involvement as a youth in gay protest, it brought raw emotions to recall how angry we young people were then. But more importantly for me it reminded me like it was only yesterday of the immense Pride we felt at fighting for our rights and anyone who was a victim of hatred and prejudice.All of the actors were a delight, and the portrayal of working class solidarity spot on and very emotional. I loved the fact that it had that British humour that is so peculiar to this country. The details were very true to the time, I recognised the clothes, the music and how tatty gay clubs were with peeling paint on the walls. It is a film that brings to life a time that has not been portrayed before, of protest, solidarity and how together we can change things.I'm glad that such a film can be made and successful in this country now as a mainstream film as well. Maybe that shows that the protest of our youth changed things. I can get married now if I wish and thanks to a Tory PM, who'd have thought it? So one big thank you to all involved for making this 50 something gay man remember so vividly, and in spite of the dark days portrayed, our youthful struggle and reminding us that we really did something wonderful and change things, as this film is proof positive that we did just by the fact that is got made.I hope that young gay people, who still cope with the same problems we did, isolated, alone, and scared can watch this film and gain strength from it and join the fight against prejudice still to be won.",positive
Belle,"Enjoyed it first when I watched the drama. After reading up on the true history later, I was a bit disappointed to see what a far cry the movie is from historical reality.Yes Lord Chief Justice Mansfield, Dido Elizabeth Belle as a mixed-race aristocrat, and John Davinier did exist in history. The problem is Lord Mansfield was a brave key figure in the Abolitionist Movement in his own right instead of a 'reluctant' reformer as portrayed in the movie!The true Dido in history was not only beautiful, but also well-versed in law and politics. She acted as Lord Mansfield's legal secretary inside the Kenwood residence...Unfortunately due to her mixed-race, she was never given the option to marry a man of equal nobility and intellect. She only married after Lord Mansfield, both her mentor and protector died. She did become Mrs. Davidier, but her husband was a French servant instead of an aspiring, abolitionist lawyer in the movie.If Dido lived in modern days, she would have become an highly accomplished barrister or Chief Justice herself. Instead she married someone who could hardly be her intellectual equal. She became home-maker with three children and died young in her early 40s.",negative
Belle,"I just saw an advance screening of BELLE--and I absolutely loved it. The dialog, directing, performances, costumes, locations, and cinematography were all fabulous. It's based on the mesmerizing and romantic true story of the beautiful, intelligent, mixed race daughter of an admiral, who was raised in Georgian England by her aristocratic great-uncle and his wife. The script hits all the right notes as Belle struggles to find her place in a society that doesn't quite accept her, and with the help of an idealistic young vicar's son (Sam Reid-- fantastic), influences an important anti-slavery case. Congratulations to director Amma Asante and writer Misan Sagay for bringing this story vividly to life on the screen. Gugu Mbatha-Raw was luminous as Dido Belle, and I think Tom Wilkinson gave the best role of his career. Both are Oscar-worthy performances. The film is highly recommended.",positive
The Old Man & the Gun,"Those of you who are Robert Redford fans - you won't be disappointed. Those of you who aren't Robert Redford fans - you won't be missing a whole lot.Like a lot of RR movies - it's a kinda, sorta entertaining film about a kinda, sorta interesting real-life event - in this case a career criminal who kept robbing banks into his 70s.Like a lot of Redford films, it's a comedy-drama. Sort of.Will you laugh out loud, cry, or even become particularly emotionally invested in the film at any time? Probably not, whether you're a Redford fan or not.Will you like it? That definitively depends on whether you're a Redford fan. If you are, you will walk away feeling you watched a movie that - while not particularly exciting or funny - is nonetheless a worthwhile effort as an artistic venture. If you're not into Redford - you will find it pretentious and slow with a somewhat inflated opinion of its own self-importance.",negative
The Old Man & the Gun,"When have you ever been able to sit back and watch a man commit a crime with a smile on his face and not even feel remotely bad for the people he is victimizing? Personally, I always watch heist movies and feel bad for the victims, regardless of how truly endangered they are. If your leading man or lady has good intentions, then it becomes easier to watch, but I've never quite had an experience like The Old Man and the Gun before. This is a film that takes its time telling the story at hand and there's hardly ever an exciting moment, but it never feels like it drags. This is (surprisingly) a true story that I believe everyone will get a kick out of and here's why.Following Forrest Tucker (Robert Redford) after he has escaped from prison, The Old Man and the Gun is really just about a man who doesn't have many years left in his life and simply wishes to do what makes him happy. Robbing banks in the most polite way that he possibly can, without ever harming anyone, and pretty much always getting away with it, the character of Forrest is absolutely perfect for the way this film portrays him. Whether he's in a high-speed chase to the sound of a calm country song or sitting in a diner with a woman whom he's trying to form a connection with, this is truly one of the most relaxing experiences I think I've ever had at the movies in quite some time.Robert Redford has always been a likable screen presence. Since his early days in movies like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid to even small roles in films like Pete's Dragon today, he has always had the charisma to charm his audience. This may very well be his final performance and if that's really the case, I believe he has gone out on a very high note. I don't believe this film isn't going to win any awards or really be nominated for all that much, but in terms of purely enjoying a character on-screen, The Old Man and the Gun delivers on everything you'd expect, and then some.Yes, as I said, this is a very calm film, so what's a calm experience without the much-needed elements. For a movie like this, you'd expect a slow score and music that will put you at ease, along with some solid comedy in the moments where he may be going a little too far for his particular characteristics. The film provides all of that and more. There were moments where I felt he was about to go out of character, but then the film either came up with a joke to make you feel comfortable about his choices or played a country song that was so on the nose that it makes you laugh. For as slow as this film is, it never once had me checking my watch. This 90-minute film flies by, even with its slow pace.In the end, The Old Man and the Gun is the type of film that's very hard to find a complaint about. It has a specific direction and it sticks with it throughout its entire duration. It's about a wanted gentleman who goes under the radar and robs banks, finds love and is continuously hunted by the police (namely a cop played by Casey Affleck, who is also extremely enjoyable in the movie). Look, if you're looking for a complex cops and robbers story, then I would look elsewhere, but if you just want to relax at the movies and have a good time, this is the perfect film for exactly that. The Old Man and the Gun comes highly recommended from me.",positive
The Wind Rises,"I'm going to pull out all the stops as I'm trying to verbalize how mightily impressed I am with ""Kaze tachinu"" (2013), or ""The Wind Rises"". Miyazaki has now been at the top of his game for well over thirty years, and his latest and apparently last film is remarkable in all the usual modi operandi – luxuriant use and understanding of colour, extraordinary level of detail in even the most mundane-seeming particulars that make the scenes come to life, fantastical sense of the relationship between dreams and imagination and reality, and how the story stems from the images and extends to the world of the creator, and ours. The film tells the story of Horikoshi Jiro, a genius whose enthusing search for perfection makes him descend the dream-path laid down in his youth. A story of determination, the film is also a profound meditation on the forces of nature: Tokyo destroyed in the earthquake and by fire, the aircraft in shreds and pieces. The influence and inspiration given to Jiro by what only he seems to be able to see around him makes him the visionary that he is. Airplanes, trains, ships, radiators. The path to advance technology, first by exposure, then by imagination and invention. To be either Achilles, twenty years behind, or the tortoise. Filmmaking is very much the same: seeing the unseen, imagining that which has not been imagined. This is not compromise or pampering to the lowest common denominator, but art that goes all the way beyond our wildest dreams and is still able to describe the indescribable so lucidly we become enraptured and immediately converted.All the Miyazakis I've seen have some incredulously indelible moments without compare. Here there are several, including the utterly beautiful dreams, especially the wind, the opening five minutes in full, the remarkable sound design during the dreams and the earthquake, the water, the rain, and the flight.And speak of the wind! It has personality, it's brilliant and as powerful as in ""Ran"" (1985), ""Zerkalo"" (1975) or ""The Wind"" (1928), in some ways even more so because it's animated in ways impossible to achieve in live action. And the love that uncharacteristically seems to evade and elude, as it does in Wong Kar-Wai's ""Fa yeung nin wa"" (2000). She paints, and the picturesque mise en scène and the atmosphere is comparable to ""Van Gogh"" (1991) and its languorous lushness. Then there's Thomas Mann's ""The Magic Mountain"" used by Castorp as an allegory for forgetting, yet the novel becomes real through Nahoko's illness and not as a token of forgetting but instead of never forgetting.And then there's the war. ""It flies like a dream"", the pilot says, thanking Jiro during the apparent climax of the film, and Miyazaki cuts to a scene of utter destruction, a cemetery of people, ideals, ideas and technology, a disaster not unlike the earthquake in the beginning, yet so tragically unlike.The name of the film comes from a quotation from Paul Valéry, but refers to Ghibli: the name of the studio but also the engine of the aircraft in ""Porco Rosso"" (1992). It's a real engine used in an Italian aircraft during World War II, designed by the Caproni seen in the film. In a way, then, this is as natural a conclusion to Miyazaki's career as one could imagine: a flight of imagination, carried by the most powerful wind, and a shared dream of great minds that we are lucky to be invited in.",negative
The Wind Rises,"The announcement of this film was a pleasant surprise after Ponyo and From Up on Poppy Hill, which both had simple, childish plots. Few films in Japan have tackled the lives of imperial period heroes; the ghosts of the 1960s urge people to denounce what really happened in that time and memorialize an imaginary anti-war movement, for example in this year's film ""Shounen H"". For Miyazaki to choose a subject like this showed that he was really going for a huge challenge. Miyazaki is of course anti-war and environmentalist. But Ghibli films are never negative. What sort of positive image of the Zero bomber inventor would Miyazaki produce?The result is astounding. As everyone has noted, this is not a children's movie. It's complex, so it doesn't have the epic sense of Miyazaki at his best, but history and adulthood are just as complex, and Miyazaki does justice to both. The film indeed stays positive throughout, by showing from start to finish how everyone wishes they themselves would behave, rewarding the viewer with virtue and beauty, but without being condescending about the hardships of real life. In a sense, the film is about the ""importance of dreams"", but it's also about what it means to be a dreamer in real life, and how our highest fantasies can be turned into beauty if we put our minds to it. The cartoon medium is put to full, extravagant use in dream sequences that merge right into the narrative. Certain elements at the end of the film leave the obvious unsaid in a peculiarly Japanese and fulfilling way. The most classic films of Japan, like the great works of Akira Kurosawa and Yasujiro Ozu, say something profound about the meaning of life, and Kaze Tachinu deserves a place among those ranks.",positive
A Street Cat Named Bob,"The perfect friendship between human and feline. Sometimes watching an uplifting film without the need of serious drama or constant character deaths is just what the doctor ordered...or in this case the veterinarian. Homeless, addicted to drugs and constantly high, busker James believes he has hit rock bottom. But when he stumbles across an injured ginger cat in his newly sheltered accomodation, his life changes forever...and for the better. The street cat named Bob is played by Bob who is the real Bob that is the street cat Bob...yeah. Undeniably, Bob is adorable and that is coming from someone who despises domesticated felines. However, beneath the cutesy exterior is an emotive story about second chances. Just when you think life couldn't get any worse, hope is just around the corner...in the shape of a cat. Now, addressing the subject of drug addiction and homelessness may have been brushed over slightly too much but there are scenes that tackle this and do evoke a sense of power. The problem I find with 'nice' films like these is that they are unmemorable. The chances of me remembering this in a week's time are slim, but it's entirely watchable and what I would class as a ""Sunday afternoon"" film. Luke Treadaway surprisingly holds the film on his shoulders as Bob sits on them. Various scenes were weak in the acting department but just take it with a pinch of salt, it's fine. It's the uplifting story and the fact it all happened that really provides the entertainment. Loved the POV camera shots of Bob's perspective as he rummages around a bush or attempts to catch a mouse, reminiscent of the old Tom & Jerry cartoons. The supporting cast members were weak and I would've liked more attention aimed towards James' backstory. However, aside from the predictabilities, this is an enjoyable watch and, if anything, has heightened my love for cats. I no longer despise them...I just dislike them.",negative
A Street Cat Named Bob,"As an avid cat lover I was always going to enjoy this movie. And as a person who myself suffered an addiction, and am in recovery, I totally related to the Lead Character in every way. Whilst dealing with the subject of addiction is a very difficult issue to cover, I thought this movie covered it well. Highlighting the lead character's isolation,, detachment from the outside World and people in general........and the redemption he found by meeting Bob, a wandering cat, who just happened to enter his life.The touching story line that involved the developing relationship between him and Bob was beautifully told. The cat made him smile again, gave him a reason to live. His social skills with people were not good but with the cat, he became stronger and happier as each day passed.This was a wonderfully uplifting film I related to on so many levels. Excellent acting, and Bob the cat. was the best of them !",positive

The Walk,"The Walk (2015) *** (out of 4) The incredible true story of high-wire walker Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who got to live his dream of crossing the Twin Towers in 1974.THE WALK was first brought to the screen in the Oscar-winning documentary MAN ON WIRE but obviously director Robert Zemeckis saw something in the story that made him want to turn it into a feature. THE WALK was released to Luke warm reviews and it ended up dying a rather painful death at the box office but I'm going to guess that it won't be forgotten but instead fine a good cult audience somewhere down the road.The story itself is something of complete wonder and there's no question that the documentary did a much better job at telling it. With that said, even thought the documentary is the better of the two films, this feature still offers up some impressive visuals and performances that makes it worth seeing. I didn't get to see the film in 3D so I can't comment on that but I thought Zemeckis did a wonderful job at making the viewer see and feel how high up Petit was.The scenes certainly have a very claustrophobic feel to them and you can't help but panic yourself just wondering what you would do in a situation like that. Just reading or hearing about the story will make you wonder how a human could do it but this film gives you a great feel and idea of the terror that it would cause in most people. Gordon-Levitt gives a very good performance in the role of Petit and I especially liked how the movie didn't back down from him at times not being so likable. I thought the actor did a remarkable job getting into the role and you had no problem believing that he was the real guy.THE WALK does contain some flaws and that includes it running on a bit too much. Everyone going into the movie knows the story so there's a rush to get to the actual walk in the movie. I thought the early stuff dragged on a bit too much and I think some editing probably would have helped things. However, once we actually get to the walk itself there's no question that the magic takes over and that alone makes the film worth sitting through.",negative
The Walk,"Robert Zemeckis continue's to be of the best director's in Hollywood. He has made a beautiful movie and even though you know what happens, he keeps you gripping your armrests and holding your breath until the very end. Joseph Gordon-Levitt shines in this role along with the rest of the cast.I suppose this review is also for the people who were in New York during 9/11. As a survivor of 9/11, I couldn't help but cry at the end of the movie. Seeing the Twin Towers rising in all their glory, basking in the sunset and reminding us of their beauty that so many of us took for granted, brought back so many emotions for me. They were like old friends saying hello and goodbye one last time.Thank you Zemeckis for telling a great story, making a beautiful movie and bringing back old friends to life!If possible, go see it in IMAX!

The acting is well done, the story line is easy to follow and i must say there were more then a few times i got dust in my eyes and they watered.

Thought sure we would have been given that during the credits....or somewhere.The only negative was that we chuckled at the way the guys were made to look ""older"" at the Hall of Fame performance.

I've never been into musicals...ever...my favorite up to this point was ""The Sound of Music,"" which inspired me to get into the film industry in the first place, yet, we found ourselves seat dancing and bopping in our seats. We really enjoyed the interpersonal approach of having the characters each expressing their takes and their understanding of each situation, which brought a lot of comedic character moments to the storyline and subplots. But the the thing that impressed us the most, was the decision to make the film NOT feel like a musical. No-one busted out in song at the wrong time...and the singing moments felt completely unforced. It was like watching a living biographical film. Great Directing job by Clint Eastwood.Lastly, we didn't realize how many great hits Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons had.

"Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot","//Revelation Film Festival Review//Joaquin Phoenix delivers another extraordinary performance bringing to life the true story of John Callahan, a man who finds his calling as a cartoonist following a devastating car accident that left him a quadriplegic. Unfortunately, for all of Phoenix's best efforts, he's let down by a disjointed narrative that jumps all over the place leaving the film feeling jumbled and confused.Compounding the disappointment is the knowledge that it's the first film from veteran indie filmmaker Gus Van Sant (Good Will Hunting, Milk) following his disastrous The Sea of Trees. Despite being made with sincere and genuine intentions, Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot seems to been made in the same blender as Van Sant's previous mess. Maybe he's loosing his touch?",negative
"Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot","Joaquin Pheonix and Jonah Hill give stand out performances in this amazing movie. Struggling to find anything these days to watch that even rates as value, this movie ticks all the boxes. The ending took me by surprise as the story is based on a true story and that made it even more worthwhile.
Although there have been countless films made about alcoholics, their recovery and AA, this was different. This felt as if the viewer was there, not watching a movie with actors. Standout performance was Joaquin Pheonix. I have always thought he was a great actor but in this his is nothing short of brilliant.",positive
Colonia,"If one were to judge ""Colonia"" purely on face value, it would be an average film. It jumps around a bit, doesn't have a clear narrative, and doesn't really even have all that much resolution. When you consider that it is based on true events, however, it needs to be judged in that capacity. With that in mind, ""Colonia"" becomes a much more experience considering they had to keep somewhat on track with the real life events.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Lena (Emma Watson) & Daniel (Daniel Bruhl), two young adults who happen to get caught up in General Pinochet's military coup of Chile (both were protesting against that very action). Daniel is sent away to some sort of cultish camp (Colonia Dignidad) which is led by the brutal and enigmatic Paul Schafer (Michael Nyqvist). Lena volunteers for the women's section of the cult/camp, experiencing similar horrors of her own in order to track Daniel down and hope to come up with an escape plan.Probably the biggest ""knock"" I'd have on this film is that parts of it really don't make sense (and really don't even try to). In film-making convention, that is kind of a no-no. You never really understand the motivations behind some of the characters or the things that happen.At the same time, though, that is a large part of why this movie can be quite effective when looked through a different lens...that of reality. One of the characters, a fellow cult member to Lena, utters a quote along the lines of ""don't try to make sense of this place...you never will"". That's what the viewer has to do when watching this movie, too. Instead of dissecting it, this is one of those movies where you just have to sit back and allow yourself to think ""this was actually a real place"". Once you see what happened inside the walls of the cult, that thought alone will make you shudder.It helps, of course, that the acting is mostly spot-on. Watson is perfect, as usual (it's too bad she is taking a bit of a sabbatical these days, as her work is always stellar), and Schafer's character is legitimately creepy. Plus, there is just an air of weirdness and mystery surrounding the entire project that gives it a great sense of foreboding and tension.Overall, I enjoyed watching ""Colonia"" as much for its uniqueness and ""true story"" nature (especially one I had never heard of before) as anything else. Like I said, if you critique it on ""script cohesiveness"" alone it might come up lacking, but once you let the gravitas of its real-life events sink in I think it will move you to care about the characters and their situations.",negative
Colonia,"Stumbled across this title. Looked interesting. Gave it a shot and was pleased with what I watched. Not knowing a single thing about the movie or the real history behind it, I went into this thinking it was going to be about something totally different. I was even surprised when at the beginning I saw the name ""Emma Watson"". I knew good things were gonna happen. So as it unfolded, I thought it was gonna be some political thriller where the boyfriend gets kidnapped by the army goons and then he has to escape. Imagine my surprise when it took a turn to Chilean/Deutschland Jonestown!!! Didn't see that coming! The old hag nazi b!tch was excellent. You just knew right away that you wanted her to get clubbed over the head with a blunt object. Thanks Emma for granting my wish. I didn't care for the love story, but it drove the film. Anyhow, I don't want to give anything away, just suffice to say - this is worth your time watching!",positive
Concussion,"Concussion has to be the worst edited film I've ever seen. In the first scene, Will Smith's lines of dialogue cut awkwardly across each other just as the camera inexplicably jumps from different angles. Much of the story is very hard to follow, such as showing the death of one NFL player and then discussing another, not approaching the on-screen death until about 20 minutes later. The death of Mike Webster is very confusing, as it shows him tasering himself (which Webster used as his only method of achieving sleep) and then cuts to his body on the operating table, implying heavily that the taser caused his death and contradicting the entire movie. Not to mention that the 2 hour movie feels more like 3, courtesy of sluggish pacing and unnecessary scenes. The story would have been better off having Omalu and his wife already married at the start, allowing for almost 10 minutes to cut footage right there.Will Smith is the only reason to watch this movie. His accept is a large part of why he is able to disappear into Bennet Omalu, because you will watch him on screen and yet not see the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Sometimes you want to just say ""yes Will, good acting, well done"" such as an overdone scene where he smashes the wall and rocks back and forth like a child. Surprisingly, it is the subtle nuances that make Smith's performances, and its the wannabe Oscar scenes that leave a foul taste.In the supporting cast, Albert Brooks and Alec Baldwin cancel each other out as they both clamour for screen time. Were one to lose, it should have been Brooks who comes across as a very inconsistent character and contributes very little. Alec Baldwin has a few nice moments but nothing to stand out, as does the infinitely under-appreciated Adewale Akkinouye-Agbaje. David Morse is the one who really stands out in his few scenes as Mike Webster. Mike O'Malley's caricature Daniel exists only to fluff up conflict and comes across as the embodiment of evil rather than having any legitimate protest.There's nothing subtle about the way the story is seeking to be shut down. Peter Landesman scripted Kill the Messenger, and it should never have surprised me that he's using so many of the same elements here. FBI agents show up, ostensibly in cahoots with the NFL (which never happened in real life). The main character's wife is stalked. They dig up dirt on main characters to discredit them. And then there's the final redemption, involving a speech to a quiet audience. He did them better in Kill the Messenger, whereas here (especially because they are largely fictitious) they come across as silly.Concussion tells an interesting story, but there's nothing gripping about it. Put it on in the background, but don't rush out to see it.",negative
Concussion,"I am a survivor of playing on high school concussions. I finally quit playing by so many positive family influences in my life. I grew up playing Texas football, the ""American Dream"". I received my final football concussion in 2000 and discontinued playing football. Troy Aikman was the only one anyone talked about at this time regarding concussions and everyone thought he was fine. What they didn't talk about which this movie does a great job is pointing out all the players that died or had violent disruptive behavior due to post conclusion syndrome. I rated this movie a 10 because there will be millions of dollars spent to make the movie go away. It's important for every parent in America to understand what football can do to your kids. Football is a great sport but their can be serious life consequences that can come from it. Football 2000 years later will be looked at as Roman Gladiators once were. I loved every minute of my experience with football growing up. But the reality is the overwhelming effects this sport causes to our brains. It was once said to me that if the brain injury could be seen on the outside of your body it wouldn't even be a question if football would still be a sport. However, it's not and that's why it's unspoken. I very much support this movie and I am glad that Sony Pictures (only non nfl contract) took the liberty to show people what this sport's health effects can have on young kids and adults. Hope you enjoy my real-life review. I feel lucky to be alive. Lucky that I was surrounded by people that could think there was more to life then the ""American Dream"". God Bless",positive
Lords of Chaos,"We all know the story, and now it was put on film. It made Oystein a very likable if not fake persona, the film is brutally honest about how Varg thought Euronymous was fake and only wanted attention, while in the same breath Varg went to the media seeking the attention. The casting for Varg was questionable at first but I thought Cohen brought a good perspective on the narcissism of Varg after watching it twice now. It made all of this seem very possible and realistic which was admirable on Jonas's part. Everyone was called out, no one was spared. The violence is gruesome and the most realistic I've seen in a while. It was funny, violent and had a sex scene, it's got alot of layers to it that BM fans would consider ""gay"" and pointless, but then again as the director says ""If black metal fans are against everything why would they be for this film?"" Touche.",negative
Lords of Chaos,"Some really disturbing scenes in this piece, based loosely on the tragedy. Not for the faint hearted, some good acting and very lifelike gore.
Not a bad film by any means!",positive
Big Eyes,"I was stuck with this movie because it was the only one that fit my schedule. I knew nothing of the plot. The beginning credits run. Amy Adams! Always a great actress. Tim Burton the director. This could be good! A good beginning to the movie. The time period is portrayed in realistic fashion. The heroine, a painter, has a difficult life. She leaves her husband. A courageous move for the time period.She has to start from scratch in a new city. She meets a fellow painter. He appears to be her soul mate. He is an interesting character. He promotes her career. They get married. Interesting process. Colorful supporting characters, including Terrance Stamp.The story stalls along the way. The punch to the story is the heroine's resentment that her husband takes credit for her paintings. She creates the paintings for him. He claims them as his own. Although he is presented as a strong-willed character, she does not have the guts to tell him to stop. She hides the secret for years. Even from her daughter! (yawn ...) Will she get the guts to stop the fraud? I could not have cared less by the time the issue was resolved. Near the end, there is a big court scene with her husband suddenly acting like he is in ""Trial and Error,"" the comedy with Jeff Daniels and Michael Richards. Although I am sure the writers thought the court scene was clever and funny, the audience I was with sat in stunned silence. When she outs her husband in the national news, her daughter is proud. We are supposed to be emotionally invested. I was bored beyond all belief. I felt manipulated. In the end, the heroine is not a sympathetic character. The supporting actors are more interesting. Would never want to see this movie again. Good style. Good characters. No plot for the characters to shine.",negative
Big Eyes,"The Warhol quote is making fun of its ghastliness and the invisible hand of the market. An odd choice to start on by mocking its own subject. As well I sense a subconscious undercurrent reflecting his own brand.But the key to Tim Burton has always been Disney not Gothic. Here is finally a proper Gothic work in being everything but, with its colorful San Francisco and Hawaii; Waltz through structures of mental control, abuse in power, serial plagiarizing, is a Gothic monster.There would be inheritances in stories like this.But it's about speech as well and how if you don't say it it'll never be said, begging the tragedy how painting isn't enough. Her eyes don't just see but can't not see. They gaze the heightened details of the world. Then would be susceptible to larger than life psychologies which would entice her in love. A Gothic torture how love controls her. Then when images can't be hers, she chooses numbers. Numerology in the pop 60s make her almost a chosen one for backing the zeitgeist: late 20th century advanced statistics would forecast and streamline every single industry. Her drawings very much forecasted the medium of anime, which rivals all of world cinema. By her own devices left unchecked might've lead to some great garage start-up, Mac, PC... Keane. In all seriousness societal mechanics denying her ability to grow in art reminds me of Burton himself trapped in the machine of his brand.Credit. Silence. Eyes. Its elements fuse a true fright. ""Mother, I know..."" Few will know the soul-crushing abuse of others taking credit for their work.Usually, a woman so pretty would not be a Tim Burton outsider but the spark of her ghoulish secret drawings make her as him. Oddest. The whole film is about these demonic traumatized orphans happening in its background. A battlefield seems to be the anger as the commodification of western privilege. But against the abstract expressionist backdrop it's a valid contrary.Most beautiful is it's this Tim Burton art film where performers are allowed to act not pose, even though it abuses green screen (its artifice you could say is Warholian at least...); much is said about the overacting, where Waltz has to strut around and make a great show of it, but he's being watched by Burton and Keane's; eyes so big warrant big visions.",positive
Kill the Messenger,"Jeremy Renner did a great job playing the Gary Webb character. It is sad to see that our own government can do such horrible thing to its own people. It does not seem like to this date that anyone have been held accountable to such action even after the truth have been revealed.That fact that the government can so easily cover up any articles that it does not like is troubling. It makes it hard to distinguish the U.S. journalism as oppose to the Putin's controlled news media or the Chinese government news reports. The final thing I find troubling is how on earth can someone commit a suicide by shooting themselves in the head ""twice""? That alone seems a bit suspicious.",negative
Kill the Messenger,"I drove 140 miles, round trip, in foreboding weather, to attend the nearest U.S. opening.It was well worth it.First some context.I've freelanced for decades, including during a war, successfully exposed major governmental corruption, weathered concerted retaliation and have been regularly appalled at the weakness of corporate, bureaucratic and political weasels who abandoned ideals, professionalism and integrity, ""going along to get along."" I was aware of Webb's writing and vilification at the time they occurred, in the late '90s, but for over 50 years I had a front row seat for even pre-Nixonian ""drug wars"" through the ""crack epidemic,"" genocidal American imperialism, and the treatment of many other reporters who dared challenge the status quo, who had the courage to painfully examine the quaint and naive notion of collective national decency.Webb's story, so artfully recounted and performed, was unfortunately true. He was accused of distorting the actuality of Reagan-era hypocrisy, but his reporting was accurate. He never accused the CIA of intentionally destroying the social fabric of minority communities, but made it clear that Harlem and Watts and Chicago's South Side were victims of ""collateral damage,"" the inevitable consequences of the abandonment of any pretense of morality ostensibly possessed by the Reagan administration.Indeed, spurred by new information about the practice of questionable property seizures, Webb had once again picked at the scab covering the decade-old, gangrenous infestation of our government, later well described by Robert Parry in his October 2004 Salon piece, ""How Kerry exposed the Contra-cocaine scandal."" To get the story, Webb had exposed himself to blood curdling danger, both at his own home in the U.S. and on the scene, in Central America.Perhaps the worst betrayal of public trust by this film is depicted in recapitulation of the collective response of the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, after being pressured by the CIA and the State Department. The papers' responded with hyperactive involvement in the personal destruction of Webb's reporting, reputation and life. Previously. the same papers, pressured by Reagan administration officials, buried Senator John Kerry's investigation, and shared subsequent malfeasance in their facilitating the Bush/Cheney administration's illegal and genocidal invasion and occupation of Iraq.The NY Times and Post had some odious history themselves. Reporters Ray Bonner and Alma Guillermoprieto were reassigned to boring beats after their courageous exposure of the incredibly savage El Mozote Massacre in El Salvador.There, the U.S. trained, funded and armed Atlacatl Battalion murdered almost a thousand peasants, largely neutral evangelical Protestants, and mostly women and children, on December 11, 1981. Stanley Miesler's El Mozote Case Study, published in the Columbia Journalism Review, exhaustively documented their fates.This film captured all those similar disgraceful elements. It needs to be seen by a wider audience just as it would be wise to make ""Dr. Strangelove"" part of a core curriculum in the formal education of American adolescents.",positive
42,"42 is a movie about that particular black man, who entered the league for the very first time, challenged everyone, including his teammates and won. Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) became the pioneer athlete to stand alongside the white sportsmen on the field when segregation & racial discrimination was a ""rule"" in United States. However, film does not actually follow the whole story of Jackie, it more tells a story of racial revolution in baseball, which escalated after one bold decision of Brooklyn Dodgers executive - Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford). Branch was the first manager to hire a black man, a talented black man who ran fast, who could catch any ball and who could bring hundreds of black spectators to the field. And since every of them, regardless their skin color paid money to see Robinson playing, this new transfer to the team could be successful.Brian Helgeland wrote a pretty interesting and engaging script, with really good dialogues (well, he has a great experience of it from LA Confidential and Mystic River). Even though there is no much tension in the movie, it still makes you enjoy every minute of it. At first I was not comfortable with the idea of racial discrimination, because I've seen so many good movies on this topic, and it just makes me feel bored. Most of them look like each other much. I believe that any film that regards this topic, shall be very much emotional, which helps director to deliver a message successfully. The last film that affected on me, and for sure on every person, was The Help - a masterful presentation of historic segregation. But 42 does not arise rave emotions, it instead provokes great satisfaction. That is why 42 is an above average film.Picking totally unfamiliar actor, Chadwick Boseman, for lead role, which actually presents the whole idea of the movie, is a risky choice by director. But Jackie was exactly as it should be. Chad delivers a passionate, evolving character who struggles with his emotions and almost every person surrounding him. His convincing performance is really worth to call potentially one of the best performances this year.And Harrison Ford, it's been years I've not seen him acting well. In fact, the portrait of Branch Rickey is one of the best performances he'd ever had. Even though Mr. Ford gets older, he can make Brooklyn Dodgers story unbelievably interesting.As for the rest of cast, everyone is good. Maybe not the best actors you can imagine, but they make a good team and there is nothing we can reject about their performances.",negative
42,"I'm a middle-aged black man now and sometimes I wonder if young people get it.I was born in Richmond, VA, and I'm 1 (ONE) generation removed from segregation. It is because of this that I was FLOORED by the performance of these young actors. Chadwick Boseman & Nicole Beharie did a magnificent job portraying the grace and courage of the Robinsons.I couldn't have done it. Boseman has an UNCANNY resemblance to Jackie, and his performance was so visceral that it proved to me that I couldn't have done it.I wouldn't have had the courage to stand up to racism by NOT fighting back. I wouldn't have had the patience to bide my time until folks decided it was time to see me as being more than sub-human. I absolutely wouldn't have taken the risk of playing a game while people threatened my wife and child.When Jackie finally got angry enough to smash his bat against a wall, that was the ONLY thing I could relate to - then to realize he had to go back out there because it was about MORE than just him - I was flabbergasted by his courage.This is more than a film about baseball. The nuances like watching people in second class seating still turning out to support Robinson in full-on ""Sunday church service"" dress was poignant to me.This movie ain't just about Jackie.My mom is from New York, and she was 7 years old when Jackie joined the Dodgers. She remembers this clearly.It's obvious why you (as I did) would take your kids to see this film as it shows what happened and how far we've come. For me, it shows what other people did FOR ME that I was incapable of doing for myself.This film has some corny parts to it - like most films of this ilk, it sanitizes some things and does tie a nice bow on some issues glossed over in the retelling.....that doesn't mean it's not a darned good film.I'm pretty cynical these days. It's not often that I watch a film with a lump in my throat the whole time. I am indebted to the young actors who portrayed the people of my grandparents' generation with style, class and urgency.I will own this film when it becomes available and that date can't come soon enough.",positive
The Butler,"The actors in this movie were fantastic, however the ""rewriting of history"" was terrible.The Butler's real name is Eugene Allen. Here is where the movie rewrote history: he did NOT have a son who died in Vietnam, he did NOT have a son who became a Black Panther, his mother was NO raped by a white cotton field manager, and his father was NOT murdered by the same white man.So if you take this ""made up"" stories out of this movie, you have a much different movie. What a disservice to Eugene Allen. You would think that this story could have been a true story, at the very least the opening header should make a statement that this is a FICTIONAL movie.",negative
The Butler,"Go see this movie..It shook me to my core..As a white person I've never been more ashamed in my life..And saddened.. We are in the midst of racial struggle for equal rights right now..I sat in a packed theater with all white old people and you could've heard a pin drop.. It felt like a Forest Gump movie but with the racial history of our country as the topic.. and it was NOT a pretty picture. Thank you for doing this movie Lee, it is something we all need to see as Americans and we all have to face that we still have MAJOR racial bigotry. It must NOT be tolerated! I am white, 63 yrs old, born in Miami Fl and living in LA. Please go see this and then go about being an agent of change..we need to move on to better things and stamp out racism in America..it has NO place here..and we should all be ashamed of it's existence and allowing it to persist..

No need to worry, the depiction of each by the superb John C Reilly and Steve Coogan was immaculate; sometimes you could think you were watching the originals. Matched by true authenticity and camera work, this is the best film I have seen for years. It will be very interesting to see if it receives the awards it richly deserves as it does not fit the usual description of recent Oscars etc",positive
Eddie the Eagle,"I remember Eddie the Eagle as a joke, a laughing stock, incessantly pilloried by the gutter press and sneered-at by the mainstream media alike. This film made me realise just how wrong I was.Those shots peering down from the top of the ramp at the tiny people in the distance barely hint at the terror, standing up there and knowing that when you set off, there is only one way down. They don't so much fall, as plummet.I enjoyed the humour and the music, but most of all the story ... just ... worked. I know it's dramatised, it's not a documentary. Doesn't matter. It was something unique, truly special. And the film captures the essence of Eddie's '15 minutes of fame' in a remarkably positive and upbeat way. A true Olympian.",negative
Eddie the Eagle,With a nice touch of humor you cannot come away from this movie without feeling a sense of accomplishment regardless of the actual outcome. The movie inspires you to reflect on any challenge we may have faced on our own lives and inspires us to actually rethink how we may have handled it or behaved differently. Taron Edgerton played a very believable character giving the audience a real sense at who Eddie Edwards really was and how he lived his youth through perseverance and fortitude by simply not giving up. The film cleverly portrays this very quickly through a brief introduction into Eddies childhood. The story is written well and the story really gives us a sense of who Eddie is and the drive to fulfill a promise to himself. Hugh Jackman brings a humorous side to the film with just enough serious touch that you do not loose sight of the significant effort that was made by Eddie Edwards. I was glad to be invited to a early preview and hope that all who see this film enjoy it as much as I did.,positive
Selma,"The unforgettable true story chronicles the tumultuous three-month period in 1965, when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. led a dangerous campaign to secure equal voting rights in the face of violent opposition. The epic march from Selma to Montgomery culminated in President Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965, one of the most significant victories for the civil rights movement.Director Ava DuVernay's ""Selma"" tells the story of how the revered leader and visionary Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr and his brothers and sisters in the movement prompted change that forever altered history.Yeah. Only this is a history re-write.And it's not a very good movie. Nor is it main stream. It caters to the far left and black audience which means it won't make any money. And the fact that this movie was made despite it's eventual monetary loss to the studio. Isn't enough for the likes of Al Sharpton. This movies screens like a TV film.",negative
Selma,"Many times, films of a historical nature are hard to appreciate, as in most cases one knows the story and the outcome. All our lives we have read, heard of and some even experienced the efforts of Dr. Martin Luther King. There are many hours of footage, countless recounts of his modus operandi and volumes of writings that give insight into his minds. However, this film delves deeper than the King Jr. of Black History month, and gives you an experience with his humanity as a man.Selma is quite possibly, the most powerful film ever to be made. It is very hard to describe with words, however, after leaving the theater I was obviously affected greatly by the depiction of the story behind the march from Selma to Montgomery. Director, Ava Duvernay, does an amazing job of capturing, what she refers to as, ""small moments"" that allows you to connect to the King Jr. character on a very intimate level. During a screening of the film, she spoke to this saying, ""I knew that by doing a movie on King, we would have to do speeches, and early on I obsessed about the speeches. However, when I got on set, I began to focus on how to best capture the small moments that showed King's humanity."" In the film, King Jr., portrayed by David Oyelowo, experiences many emotions, not generally associated with the civil rights activist, including guilt, shame and defeat. Oyelowo does a masterful job of bringing these emotions to light in the most subtle way. When asked about his preparation for the role, he responded, ""I always knew I would portray King Jr. I studied him, read and watched all of the video I could. I had been fortunate enough to play opposite of one of my acting idols, Daniel Day Lewis in Lincoln and see him take on the role as he did, so I did the same for King Jr. For three months, I became him. So much so that one night while looking in the mirror, I only saw King Jr., this may sound crazy, but I could not see myself.""Other strong performances include Oprah Winfrey as civil rights activist, Annie Lee Cooper. Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King, Andre Holland as Andrew Young, Lorraine Toussaint as civil rights activist, Amelia Boynton, Stephan James as John Lewis and Trai Byers as James Forman.",positive
Trumbo,"It is hilarious to read all the comments on Trumbo by the ""useful idiots"" created by the misinformation and lies perpetrated by the Left educational system and media. The film blatantly lies in several places and typically makes globalist Communism into some innocent venture. I don't have to spew any anti-Communist rhetoric because, unlike the left, I have the evidence that not only condemns this film as an act of Leftist Hollywood propaganda, but also the proof to condemn the concept of Communism in its entirety. I will simply make a list for the viewer to look up. After all, why should I do all the work of the lazy minded and laxical left. 1. Look into Trumbo's past. Especially the period between 1938 and 1942. Many Americans ( obviously including those in Hollywood) have no idea of the facts of this time period. While we hear about the Nazi invasion of Poland, you rarely ever hear about the Soviet invasion of Eastern Poland. This was the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany were allies between 1939 and June 1941. Look into Trumbo's praise for this pact and some of his work at that time conveniently NOT mentioned in the movie. 2. Soviet espionage existed in the west since 1919 NOT the 1950's. The movie begins much too late. The Cold War began with the creation of the USSR and the Communist International which created the Communist Parties of Europe and the USA and Canada. They were CONTROLLED from Moscow. This is NOT an opinion, this is found in their OWN literature. The goal, like globalists today, was to foment espionage, subversion and violent revolution in these western countries. During the Pact stated above, these Communist parties mounted strikes to affect the production of war materials for Great Britain fighting Fascism on its own. This is because global Communism was an ally at that time of Nazi Germany. 3. Intense Soviet espionage operations were in the works in the USA since the early 1920's. To get a good idea about how deep much of this went, look into the defection of Walter Krivitsky. That will introduce you to the depths of Soviet penetration of the west. 4. Since the Communist Party of the USA admitted themselves in their own policy papers that they were a subversive organization controlled from within the government of another sovereign nation, their existence and operation was illegal. Under US law of the time, simple membership therefore meant coercion with a subversive organization. This was not only applied to the Communists but also the Fascists. This was not overturned until Harry Truman took office. 5. The viewer needs to look into the operations of the CPUSA during WW2 and their efforts to locate Communists within the Americas to assist ( through covert means and sympathizers in the US Democratic Party and western intelligence services ) the Soviet Union in their occupation of Eastern Europe and the handing of China to the Communists. 6. They need to look into the defection of Elizabeth Bentley and Igor Gouzenko in 1945. They also need to look into the US Signals Intelligence Service VENONA Project which was reading Soviet messages being sent to and from the USA by Soviet agents. They need to educate themselves in the number of US Citizens revealed as communist spies working within ALL Branches of the British, Canadian and US Governments, Police and Intelligence Services. It will ASTOUND YOU. We are talking about a number approaching 1000. These are those uncovered. What about those not uncovered!!!!7. This ALL BEFORE the supposed COLD WAR BEGAN. 8. It only gets better in the 1950's and 60's. 9. In the movie Trombo they claim that no one in Hollywood was ever revealed as working for the Soviet Union as part of their espionage services. WRONG !!! What about the Sobel/Mocase Group of Soviet spies one of which was Boris Morros a Hollywood Producer and employee of Paramount Pictures. He went on to be a double agent for the FBI. If the Soviets had one group you can be damn certain they had others. Let us also remember that Trumbo and his cronies NEVER disavowed Communism. So being members of a Proved subversive organization and sticking to its dogma automatically make you guilty. What were they hiding from the US government. 10. The Communists the world over have revealed themselves that they are evil. with 95 MILLION deaths since 1917 what the heck do leftist need to be told to convince them that Communism does not have your best interests at heart. If you can outlaw and make illegal fascist groups, you should also outlaw and make illegal Communist groups. They have no interest in the United States, its democracy or its freedom. Their purpose, like Hitler, was to create a global syndicate of Communist states controlled from Moscow. How wonderful. They state themselves that this would be done from within. This includes youth groups and the taking over of universities and colleges. We see the effect of this during the Vietnam war. A just war, only fought by morons at the top of the Democratic party who refused to use the resources at hand to stop tyranny. They previously refused to fight for Nationalist China which handed China to the Communists which created the Korean and Vietnam wars in the first place. No one should EVER look to Hollywood or the media in general for facts. This only reinforces the argument against this movie which makes of mockery of the handing of atomic secrets to the enemy of the USA. Remember the Cuban missile crisis! what a laugh that was. The only people laughing are the left wing propagandists in Hollywood who are either complete idiots or support the idea of a global syndicate of Communist states. I thought the cold War was over????",negative
Trumbo,"Okay. I'll admit that I gave this film a ten because it should have a higher score altogether than the 7.3 it has, and I wanted to up it. But a solid 8 at least or even a 9, for sure. There are at least two reasons why this fine film is not getting a higher rating, I believe. One is that there are many people (including critics) who look only at it from a political standpoint, both left and right. And those on the right are not going to like it no matter what, fine acting, writing or whatever. The same in the left but conversely (and a smaller number). Secondly, this is a slow and thoughtful film that will not go over with many young viewers who are used to fast paced action and CGI content. they will find neither in Trumbo. But, for students of history and for people who like a good story, without the fluff, it is all here. Classic good vs evil dynamics coupled with the inherent contradictions. The struggle of lost faith and eventual redemption. And perhaps mostly, excellent social dynamics especially centered around family loyalty and the struggle of holding to ones personal values. As for the history, there is much here. As stated above more than any film ever having dealt with the subject. Films like ""the Front"" and ""Guilty by Suspicion"" are indeed good films that, especially at the time where breaking ground for a more nuanced exploration of the subject. That Trumbo is a biography is advantageous. A real biography, not a overly fictionalized and caricatured profile of the era. This despite that fact that some of the characters are fictionalized, they nonetheless represent the experiences and attitudes of real people. Louis C.K.'s Arlen Hird character being one. Dalton Trumbo may have had a better time of it than most, such as Hird. It is thought by some that the rising star of John Garfield was killed (literally-a heart attack) by the effect of the HUAC on him. This was a time, as the film states when people were fighting for their professional and personal life against what could be called a creeping fascist tendency in the US political environment. The fear and reaction and self promotion of many (ie John Wayne, Hedda Hopper et al.) is evident here.The writing is excellent. My hat goes off to John McNamara and Bruce Cook for their adherence to historical accuracy and verisimilitude. The dialog is remarkable and keep you involved. It keeps you thinking and hits at an emotional level that few films do at all anymore. But it all comes together with the excellent direction of Jay Roach. To bring together the historical and personal is such a way is no small feat. He deserves an Oscar (as do McNamara and Cook).I could go on...but just see the movie. You won't regret it. You can still watch Star Wars at Xmas...",positive
Anthropoid,"I have seen a lot of WW2 films from all sides. I've seen many Yugoslav films from my own country, American films showing either theaters (Pacific or Europe), a few from different countries like France, Poland, etc. quite a few Holocaust ones, ones with their own internal conflict (Finland's war with Russia) etc. I've seen many, many Russian ones (most recently Panfilov's 28) and American ones (Saving Private Ryan, but recently Hacksaw Ridge). I've seen expensive ones and cheap ones (Pathfinders: In the Company of Strangers, budget is supposedly $0, it's all volunteer work), serious ones about the Holocaust and comic ones like Tarantino's. I've seen short ones (The German, 2008) and I've seen Band of Brothers.I've seen a lot, more than most people.Having said that, this one is my favorite. It's the only one where I felt I was there, I was not just an observer, but I felt like I was part of the crew. This is the only film, war or not, in which I felt that I was there. I've never had such a strong connection to a film before.There may be inaccuracies, the personalities were a bit filmified/movie-ized, but this movie gets 10/10 on the acting and delivery of emotion.Wow. Just wow.",negative
Anthropoid,"Mission - To assassinate a top ranking Nazi Officer, Reinhard Heydrich. Not many films leave me feeling this much emotion.. so much so, I felt the need to write my 2nd review in around 5 years! I thought the casting was an interesting choice and Cillian Murphy and Jamie Dornan didn't disappoint but I really loved Anna Geislerova. Although most of the action is towards the end of the film, the lead up to the events gave a good insight to the characters which I find some films lack as they are too busy concentrating on special effects, rather than getting to know the characters. . I found myself holding my breath on many occasions! A truly gripping finale and I will definitely be watching this again.",positive
Breathe,"As Robin Cavendish clamors repeatedly that he wants to die after feeling stifled living in a Hospital, it takes much persuasion from his wife Diana to think the other way round. Here is a man who wants to see and cherish the outside world and his incapacity to do that makes him shun from the very existence of it.The movie ""Breathe"" transports you to a period where the severely disabled and in this context from the malignant polio are restrained from the rest of the society and how they spend the rest of their lives in the hospitals, even though they ache for Freedom. Robin decided to embark on freedom and this movie is an ode to his attempt to integrate into society despite his breathing difficulty, for which he uses an electric breathing tube. Robin aided by his good friend Teddy and his supportive wife Diana and son Jonathan finally manage to live the dream. Though the climax is a bit of an aberrant, but since the real life Jonathan Cavendish financed the movie and initiated the screenplay on his fathers' life, the events in the climax should be true. Andy Serkis in his directorial debut offers a decent movie with the focus mostly on Robin's life during the polio crisis. There is nothing extra-ordinary about his directing, but he manages to deliver a sensitive topic with charm and light humor, though these kind of movies require much more coherent drama and I found that lacking. The actors have a good job with the pick being Andrew Garfield, who continues to dwell in different characters and his portrayal of Robin is definitely note-worthy. Claire Foy, has a decent chemistry with Garfield, but compared to her titular role in the Crown, this seems kind of a cake walk. The rest of the cast including Tom Hollander,Hugh Bonneville and Jonathan Hyde play the parts with what the characters demand.The light hearted nature of plot is indeed a drawback as this movie somehow lacks the strong punch. The romantic portions between Robin and Diana is nothing extraordinary even in presentation and seems quite a cliché. Yes, the intent of the movie was not the romance, but even that somehow feels fizzled out.Overall, Breathe is a decent movie owing to the actors and less with the screenplay. Its worth a watch, however I personally believe the tale of Robin Cavendish needed a more packed and stronger plot. Considering the movie Wonder that had so many beautiful moments, this one kind of fails in that.",negative
Breathe,"Saw this film last night without reading any previously written reviews, and I thought it absolutely outstanding. The devotion that Robin and Diana had for each other, encountering such a life altering event only one year into a marriage would likely destroy most marriages. Addressing the ignorance and lack of empathy from the medical community must have been a real slog, and it is to their credit that such amazing inroads were made to better the lives of polio victims and other disabled persons. While the world has become a better place for those ""outside the norm"", there is still so much yet to be done. The cast and Jonathan Cavendish should win all the BAFTAs and Oscars possible. This film gave me hope that we can all be better than we are.",positive
At Eternity's Gate,"I'm a big Van Gogh fan and not only do I love Dafoe but his face is perfect for Van Gogh. Schnabel is a filmmaker I have come to trust. For extra credit, this was written by Bunuel's scenarist. On top of all this, it turns out an old friend of mine did the costumes.What's not to like?Well, long wordless walks through beautifully photographed landscapes with Elvira Madigan style piano providing the emotion (along with portentous close-ups of Dafoe's face). The type of story telling which provides episodic vignettes without either explaining them (I know some of the backstory only because I know the painter's life) or crafting them into a sustained narrative. Spme over-clever cinematographic tricks. Producer John Kilik said Schnabel didn't want to make a ""forensic"" biopic. Fair enough, but story doesn't have to grow out of dry biographical details. This approach was just too scattered to build any momentum - as opposed to Van Gogh's own letters, which start wandering and formless but develop intensity and momentum as he builds towards both success and self-destruction.Years ago, Schnabel had thought of directing the novel ""Perfume"", which he would have done wonderfully. Unfortunately those who got there first produced a bloodless, precious piece which gave no taste of the novel's vigorous forward movement. Ironically, he has done something similar with Van Gogh's life.I look forward to seeing work from everyone involved (including one surprise from Van Gogh.). But this was a wrong turn.Otherwise, you might consider that David O. Russell - no slouch himself - was at the screening and LOVED the film. So there's that.",negative
At Eternity's Gate,"Rather think of it as a painted film, with one artist (Schnabel) trying to convey what it is to be another (Van Gogh). At Eternity's Gate is an immersion into the world of Van Gogh. Art conveys something about the world and the human condition words can never express. After watching the movie I came to realize other ways of trying to understand Van Gogh and his art fall short of this immersion. If you were to take an audio tour of a Van Gogh exhibit you would not finish the tour with the same feeling or understanding as you might get from watching the movie. Everything about the movie is spare, whittled down to an essential nub. The dialogue doesn't matter. What does matter are the long, silent scenes of Van Gogh in Nature and at home, and the times where he speaks directly to the audience, informing it of what it is to be Van Gogh. The occasionally jumpy camera shots and the overlapping dialogue may not have been completely necessary (and obviously a major turn-off for various other viewers), but they do help to establish what it may have been like to be Van Gogh. Madness? Sure, if that label works for you. Clearly, Van Gogh was different. Mad or not, he had his difficulties fitting in to society, any society. The last 20 minutes or so are the most painterly. After absorbing an hour of background material, all the film and Van Gogh have told you allows you to understand his world. When he talks about light, the screen is flooded with light, but even when the screen turns to gloom, you see the world as Van Gogh did. The walls are painted as they were in the background of a Van Gogh painting. And you the viewer? You sit back and drink it all in.",positive
Get on Up,"The life and times of legendary musician/dancer James Brown told in nonlinear excerpts-from-a-life, rather than any bog-standard birth-to-death, story-form.There has been many recent musical bio-pics, so much so that a satire films have appeared about them such as Walk Hard. In such an atmosphere Tate Taylor has attempted to be different and non conventional but a lot of the time he is merely confusing, muddled and somewhat over-flashy. Moreover the movie looks like it was edited by running over the footage with a lawnmower and gluing it back at random. Flashback and flashback again was used so often that I lost track of where the movie variation on ""now"" was! Starting at the beginning (although not for this film!) While his (Brown's) father was violent and irresponsible you get the feeling he is being short changed. He did try and bring up his son rather than run away. Give him some marks for effort.However it is used (I believe) as an opening excuse for the behaviour he (Brown Snr) later displayed himself. Not that endless contradictions aren't part of this story, indeed you feel there is a sort of cop-out feel that it can't take any form of moral line. He was both anti-drugs and anti-delinquency apart from in his own actions and his own life. Dare anyone say it, the man had serious mental problems. Because if he wasn't bipolar nobody ever was or will be.Don't give me the ""it was all the drugs"" line as if the character wasn't underneath. Indeed drugs, firearms and his huge ego could easily have got him killed in the street. Bizarrely he paints himself as a victim (in real life) when on a violent rampage. I rest my case.Let's get off this merry-go-round of confusion and onto solid ground: Brown never left an audience member bored and his songs have passion and soul. We can get this from a concert CD/DVD with the real thing and Chadwick Boseman isn't anything like as good. Nor does he look much like him either (too tall). Brown actually knew little about music and and even his voice wasn't the greatest in range. Indeed I'm not even sure he could have carried a proper harmonic ballad. Marvin Gaye and Otis Redding could have wiped the floor with him on a soul standard. Rather in the manner of Liberace he became important because he told people he was important and people bought into it.(People who refer to themselves in the third party turn my stomach. If Jesus returned from the grave he wouldn't do it.) Despite its faults this is an entertaining enough piece. Wouldn't want to sit through it again and - as I say - it is a shame that the editing is such a mess. All movies need narrative and even though we are dealing with a real life a bit of fiction or guesswork is better than lurching around from one unrelated scene to another with no sense of where you are going or why...",negative
Get on Up,"I know folks have been talking about a James Brown biopic for years and I secretly hoped that it would not come to pass. I feared that it would be butchered in an attempt to ""butts in the seats"". I know folks need to make money but don't kill something wonderful in the process. This movie was WAY better than I had hoped. Kudos to Mick Jagger and a standing ovation for Mr. Chadwick Boseman.I did not see ""42"" but the brotha knocked this one clean out of the park. Loved seeing Voila Davis, Octavia Spencer and my girl Jill Scott as well. Of course, the music was amazing! I couldn't get over how Boseman captured James Brown's pattern of speech, walk, dance moves, etc. This performance was electric. Now I have to go read, ""The One"" to find out how much was fact and how much was fiction.If you have any interest whatsoever in JB music, catch this one!",positive
The Glass Castle,"Bottom line:As a movie *out of context from what really happened*, it is a well put together movie.Here's the problem though:The Glass Castle book is about a woman's traumatic life under the thumb of two psychologically damaged parents pass on psychological trauma and abuse to their children.We see parents lie to their children for their own selfish needs, put false hope in their heads only to let them down, and, of course, they also expose their children to other kinds of terrible behaviour. Unfortunately, the movie is a classic Hollywood portrayal of such a subject. We go through a few key points that occurred in the book, only to have that counterpointed with points in the screenplay as to why the parents are actually sympathetic people, and why (at the end of the day) they truly cared about the children deep down. The movie actually leaves audiences with the feeling and idea that the main character feels ""lucky"" to have the *terrible and abusive experience* she did in childhood.Absolutely no *true* responsibility is assigned to the parents that abused their children in this movie-just the idea that they are sympathetic screw ups that tried their best.Child abuse is a serious subject, and of course, we can leave it to Hollywood to take a memoir about that dark subject and turn it into a classic bitter-sweet tale of a dysfunctional (but of course all-American!) family simply getting through their lives as best as they can while deep down caring about their children.",negative
The Glass Castle,"It was not easy for Woody to play this character, but he did an outstanding job!!I was transfixed by this movie despite the sadness due to the very good acting of all members of the family.

American Animals,"This is novice director/writer Bart Layton's first full length film - previous credits are mainly documentaries, and this was the downfall for this film. The almost 2 hour length felt like 3 hours and really dragged out with the overly slow pace and unnecessary slo-mo scenes. Adding the real characters made this film feel like part documentary part film, which was annoying. It took away from the stories suspense and thrill as well as the great acting from the lead cast. Not sure why Bart chose this route, but had he not done so, this film would have been much better. The actual characters should have been introduced towards the end, or as an extra featurette in the DVD release, and he should have just focused on the films story instead of breaking the suspense each time the real life characters popped up.",negative
American Animals,"Bad title, that would lead most people to assume this movie is about violence and/or debauchery but there's very little of either. I might have been in the right mood but I was mesmerized and give it a 10 score. Based on a true story and yet a fictional retelling. You know basically what's going to happen but never exactly how events will transpire. Not one false emotion or action in this 2-hour film that treats moviegoers like adults (take THAT superheroes and CGI!). What a relief that a story doesn't take place on either coast, nor is it elitist. And although it's in the genre of heist capers this is a totally original setup. No banks, casinos, jewelry, or even cash. The perpetrators aren't sympathetic or unsympathetic, but believable. Also shows, for real, the impact on family and friends when bored young men cook up something exciting. Hitchcock would love American Animals!",positive

Based on the incredible memoir by Loung Ung, First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers, tells a haunting story of survival.

As well as an understanding of how human beings can transcend staggering circumstances. Must see!",positive
Lovelace,"The twist in this movie is when Linda Lovelace is suddenly portrayed as a victim rather than a willing participant in the porn industry. I didn't buy it. Even after many many attempts to show her as the victim, it seemed she always had numerous ways out. And she was never a woman without means to get away (surrounded by lots of coworkers and friends, many of whom implored her to fess up, and were rich and loved her or saw her as an extremely lucrative meal ticket). Over and over this movie tried to portray her as naive and innocent, i.e., she didn't realize she was auditioning for a porn film. I wonder what she thought was on the film her husband brought into the audition (spoiler alert, it was her doing what she became famous for)? It doesn't really matter how good the actors were, the script was childish and insulting to anyone with a second grade education. I can't imagine why so many well known celebrities chose to participate (maybe they didn't realize they were auditioning for a movie about a porn star). Since both lead characters real-life counterparts have died, the filmmakers could take ridiculous liberties with the story. They were definitely given the shaft.",negative
Lovelace,"Going in, I had no background story to the person Linda Lovelace. I wasn't even born yet. No idea she had passed away which was sad to learn considering what she went through and what she was able to do after wards.It's a story however that I've seen before. A young girl falls for the older guy and quickly gets married. Little does she know what kind of man he really is and he starts to beat her. But because of the way she was raised, ""always please your husband"" she didn't do anything about it. Regardless she then does this movie but hardly makes any money off it. Her and her husband were essentially scammed.Then we see that because they are in debt, he uses her to make money. Essentially as a prostitute. It's sad and depressing to watch. Of course, the way the movie is set up, we don't find this out until the last half of the film. By then, at least for myself, I didn't care about her enough to feel bad. Sure it's terrible but she did what she did and tried to use her fame to continue her career and it didn't happen.In the end, which is six years later, she's moved on and has remarried with a child and looks a whole lot better. She's written a book about her ordeal ironically called ""Ordeal"". I'm glad she was able to get out and change her life dramatically. Apparently she fought against that kind of stuff until her passing.As far as the movie is concerned at only 90 and some change, it felt longer than that. It's something I won't watch again and it isn't something I would recommend. A decent story, just couldn't get into it the way it was shot.",positive
Jackie,"""Jackie"" tells the story of the spiralling grief, loss and anger of Jackie Kennedy driven by the assassination of JFK in Dallas in November 1963. Hopping backwards and forwards in flashback, the film centres on the first interview given by Jackie (Natalie Portman, ""Black Swan"") to a 'Time' journalist (Billy Crudup, ""Watchmen"", ""Spotlight"").Through this interview we flashback to see Jackie as the young First Lady engaged in recording a TV special for a tour of the White House: nervous, unsure of herself and with a 'baby girl' voice. This contrasts with her demeanour in the interview which – although subject to emotional outburst and grief – is assured, confident and above all extremely assertive. We live the film through Jackie's eyes as she experiences the arrival in Dallas, the traumatic events of November 22nd in Dealey Plaza, the return home to Washington and the complicated arrangement of the President's funeral.This is an acting tour de force for Natalie Portman, who is astonishingly emotional as the grief-stricken ex-first lady. She nails this role utterly and completely. Having already won the Golden Globe for an actress in a dramatic role, you would be a foolish man to bet against her not taking the Oscar.In a key supporting role is Peter Sarsgaard (""The Magnificent Seven"") as Bobby Kennedy (although his lookalike is not one of the best: that accolade I would give to Gaspard Koenig, in an un-speaking role, as the young Ted Kennedy).Also providing interesting support as Jackie's priest is John Hurt (""Alien"", ""Dr Who"") and, as Jackie's close friend, the artist Bill Walton, is Richard E Grant (""Withnail and I"", who as he grows older is looking more and more like Geoffrey Rush – I was sure it was him!).Director Pablo Larraín (whose previous work I am not familiar with) automatically assumes that EVERYONE has the background history to understand the narrative without further explanation: perhaps as this happened 54 years ago, this is a bit of a presumption for younger viewers? Naturally for people of my advanced years, these events are as burned into our collective psyches as the images in the Zapruder film.While the film focuses predominantly, and brilliantly, on Jackie's mental state, the film does gently question (via an outburst from Bobby) as to what JFK actually achieved in his all too short presidency – 'Will he be remembered for resolving the Cuban missile crisis: something he originally created?' rants Bobby. In reality, JFK is remembered in history for this assassination and the lost potential for what he might have done. I would have liked the script to have delved a little bit further into that collective soul-searching.This is a very sombre movie in tone, from the bleak opening, with a soundtrack of sonorous strings, to the bleak weather-swept scenes at Arlington cemetery. The cinematography (by Stéphane Fontaine, ""Rust and Bone"") cleverly contrasts between the vibrant hues of Jackie's ""Camelot"" to the washed-out blueish tones of the post-assassination events. If you don't feel depressed going into this film, you probably will be coming out! But the journey is a satisfying one nonetheless, and the script by Noah Oppenheim – in a SIGNIFICANT departure from his previous teen-flick screenplays for ""Allegiant"" and ""The Maze Runner"" – is both tight and thought-provoking.Overall, a recommended watch.Finally, note that for those of a squeamish disposition, there is a very graphic depiction of the assassination from Jackie's point-of-view. but this is not until nearly the end of the film, so you are reasonably safe until then! Also as a final general whinge, could directors PLEASE place an embargo on the logos of more than two production companies coming up at the start of a film? This has about six of them and is farcical, aping the (very amusing) parody in ""Family Guy"" (google ""family guy logos"").(For the graphical version of this review please visit bob-the-movie-man.com. Thanks.)",negative
Jackie,"Throughout the history of cinema, there have been countless biopics of famous figures that deify their subjects and disregard faults in fear of tainting the idol they have so perfectly sculpted. In Jackie, however, Pablo Larrain subverts genre expectations in favor of a haunting psychological portrait of a woman caught in a terrifying piece of history. Famous images of Jacqueline Kennedy in her pink Chanel suit have lingered in the public's collective memory for years, but here, Larrain allows viewers to experience the week following JFK's assassination from the perspective of the woman who held his dying body in her arms. It's shot in an episodic, frantic format that replicates the psychological turmoil of post-traumatic stress as the line between past and present blurs. One ghostly scene in particular - soundtracked by Mica Levi's eerie score - follows Jackie as she wanders the White House in isolation, exploring various rooms and eventually falling asleep alone as a widow for the first time. The film's central performance by Natalie Portman will no doubt gain great attention for its dedication to every last nuance of Jackie Kennedy's mannerisms and voice, but the real success rests in Portman's relentless and layered conveyance of emotion throughout the film. She does not allow the iconic figure to become a one-dimensional reflection of the public's memory, but allows viewers to witness the conflicted feelings of nostalgia, grief, isolation, and tenacity that Kennedy experienced. The film successful solidifies the lingering of Kennedy's melancholic face as a fleeting vision set across the 60s horizon, luminous and bruised at once, but enduring through history.",positive
The Bling Ring,"Cons:
1. The first song that blasts out to start off the film is not only horrendous, but it pierces your ear-canal. It can be summarised as 'ear-rape'.
2. The lighting is over-exposed and it makes the movie look really cheap.
3. The soundtrack is not only infested with terrible music, but it just feels inserted for the sake of having music.
4. None of the characters are fleshed-out thus they have no discernible motives which makes them uninteresting. Moreover, they only seem to commit crime and lie, which makes them unlikable.
5. It bizarrely takes until 55 minutes into the film for CCTV footage to come into play. Why did it take so long for CCTV to become a plot point? Surely all rich people have CCTV installed?
6. Emma Watson (Nicki) puts on a rather patchy American accent.
7. The plot is extremely repetitive and goes round in circles as it mostly features well-off teens stealing for the sake of stealing - and that's it.
8. Apparently, none of the main characters thought to cover up their faces before, and definitely after, their first CCTV scare.
9. The on-screen chemistry between the actors appears to be almost non-existent.",negative
The Bling Ring,"Sofia Coppola is one of the most interesting and divisive filmmakers working today. It seems that with every new film she releases there's always a wide array of responses, both positive and negative. And that's very true with her new film, The Bling Ring. Some love it, and some loathe it. I personally enjoyed it very much, and the more I think about it, the more I like it and would maybe even see it again. It's an interesting and atmospheric look at American celebrity and media culture that bleakly shows how we can think being rich and famous can make us ""happy."" The film is based on a Vanity Fair article about how in 2008, a group of Californian teenagers (4 girls & 1 boy) stole millions-of-dollars worth of clothing and jewelry and possessions from celebrities such as Paris Hilton, Orlando Bloom, Megan Fox, and others. It's a stranger-than- fiction kind of story that could lend itself to exploitation, satire, or even heavy-handed moralizing, but Coppola distances herself from the lurid material and simply displays it as a set of facts. It's a cold, deadpan film, but there's several fascinating moments of insight and darkly funny commentary that make it interesting. It's been compared to Harmony Korine's similar film ""Spring Breakers,"" which also features several young girls trying to experience the media's view of what a fun Spring Break is. Whereas that film is knowingly repetitive in its dialogue and images and very violent and exploitative to get its point across, Coppola goes for a more restrained and almost documentary type of style. In fact, there's several instances where the main action is interrupted and we see scenes of the characters being interviewed after the events or TMZ-like celebrity news stories. The Bling Ring is benefited by its central young actors who give strong, naturalistic performances that feel so live-in that they give an improvisational feel. The leaders of the Bling Ring are Marc (Israel Broussard) and Rebecca (Katie Chang). Marc is the quiet, insecure gay kid who soon is taken under the wing of Rebecca, who's troubled yet confident and cold-as-ice. Broussard is charming and subtly sympathetic and Chang is hyper-perceptive, smart, and cold but not without a conscience. There's Chloe (Claire Julien), the loud and outgoing one in the group. Then there's sisters Sam (Taissa Farmiga) and Nicki (Emma Watson). It's interesting seeing Watson in a supporting role since she's arguably the most famous out of the central gang, but it pays off because of Nicki's larger-than-life, self-absorbed Valley Girl personality. Watson is the scene-stealer of the film with her smart and satirical performance that never goes over-the-top and always feels real, which makes the character that much more misguided and tragic. It's early to say something like this, but it's a performance that deserves some Best Supporting Actress recognition. Also very good and inspired here is the always funny Leslie Mann, who plays the flighty mom of Sam and Nicki and teaches them the ever so spiritual teachings of ""The Secret."" There's a scene near the end of the film between Watson and Mann that is just pure, dark comedy gold. The plot mostly consists of the gang clubbing, breaking into houses, driving around, and trying on clothes. It sounds repetitive, and well, technically it is. But Coppola distinguishes each break-in with its own tone and style and you can very subtly see how the characters change as they become more and more comfortable with invading the houses. For example, the break-in of Audrina Patridge's house is all done in one, long take from outside, across the street as Marc and Rebecca rummage through all her things and run from room-to-room and eventually leave. Another break-in finds Sam cluelessly waving around Megan Fox's pistol without a care in the world. And one of the film's most telling and haunting shots comes when the gang is inside Lindsay Lohan's house and Rebecca stares at the mirror and smiles so genuinely that it almost seems like that's the happiest she's ever been. It's a truly disturbing and haunting moment and the film is full of subtle images that let you into the characters' psyche and ego. But the glue that holds the film together is the dynamic between Marc and Rebecca. There's several poignant and moving moments between the two characters that cut through the film like a knife and let you into the ultimately empty and sad feelings the two characters have. Their scenes and dialogue are so sharply drawn that it reminds you just how gifted of a writer Coppola is as well. So this movie just worked for me. It's not a film that's trying to dig deep into it's subject, and it's not even really interested in telling you all of the details about this group of young robbers. It's ultimately this odd, off-kilter tone poem that's beautiful to look at and at times surprisingly poignant and hilarious. (And lastly I'd like to mention the great and legendary work of cinematographer Harris Savides, who, during shooting this film, passed away from brain cancer. The film is dedicated to him.)",positive
Never Look Away,"LIVES OF OTHERS Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck has returned with another superb drama using the arts as a backdrop to show the difficult 20th century history of the German people (Henckel von Donnersmarck famously got side-tracked with a disastrous Hollywood film, THE TOURIST starring Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie - it satisfied nobody save for the Golden Globes).NEVER LOOK AWAY takes a long look at the 30 years between the rise of Nazism to the flowering of modern democracy in the 1960s. It's filtered through the eyes of a budding artist named Kurt Barnert (played by three actors, but, chiefly by Tom Schilling). The movie begins with young Kurt attending an exhibit of so-called 'Degenerate art' in 1938 with his loving, if troubled, Aunt Elisabeth (Saskia Rosendahl). WWII soon breaks out, and Kurt's Aunt is dispatched to an institution. The Barnert family ends up on the East German side of the Cold War. It is behind the Iron Curtain that artist freedom gets stifled once anew. It leads Kurt and his love, Ellie (Paula Beer, who bears a striking, and not coincidental, resemblance to Kurt's beloved Aunt) to escape to West Germany.Henckel von Donnersmarck, who also wrote the screenplay, takes a novelistic approach to the material. At 168 minutes, patience is a necessity. But, the brilliance of the movie is that it doesn't feel indulgent. Rather, the nuances and symbolism feel of a piece. The cinematography by the great Caleb Deschanel (THE NATURAL, RIGHT STUFF) is expansive, but, in service of the story. The score by Max Richter, too, is artistic, without being showy. NEVER LOOK AWAY's true theme is the pursuit of artistic freedom - and, truth (the title refers to something his Aunt tells him about never looking away at reality - harsh as it may be). While there is no question that the movie crosses over into melodrama, its underlying authenticity isn't. The large cast is excellent, including the two main leads (Beer is particularly exceptional), but to the smallest of roles.The story is inspired by modernist artist Gerhard Richter, who went through a similar life of turbulence and success (including the forced institutionalizing of a close Aunt). Richter is one of the subjects interviewed in the recent documentary THE PRICE OF EVERYTHING. In it, Richter still expresses his artistic ideal: Art should be in museums, and not in the hands of the wealthy few. Henckel von Donnersmarck's movie is a worthy expression of that idealism. It's also one of the year's best movies.",negative
Never Look Away,"I am reluctant to write my review of this film, only because I fear I won't do it justice. This film is a masterpiece of the first order. According to Wikipedia, it received a 14-minute standing ovation when it was first shown at a European film festive. I can testify that it received a 14-minute standing ovation in my living room.We follow a small circle of characters through approximately 30 years of tumultuous history. We are intensely interested in the fate of each of them. There is humor, pathos, agony, exhilaration, discovery, closure, wonder, and astonishment in every scene. The acting is astounding, as is every other aspect of movie making. Bach's beautiful ""Sheep May Safely Graze"" is used throughout the movie; ironically, of course, because in Hitler's Germany, the sheep were not safe.My life has rarely been changed, set on a new path, by a film, but I can say this one has done it. I wish the same for you. Watch it over a period of two days, because you probably won't be able to take it all in in only one.",positive

Fruitvale Station,"I wrote one of the first reviews here of this film and it was removed before it became impossible for supporters of Oscar Grant to have such a large number of unbiased but negative reviews taken down simply because they weren't liked. It had nothing to do with the film and was purely a political move. It seems that at the time of my first review there was a movement that this thing get a major award! So I submitted another review that is even more negative than my initial one because I had more time to consider this awful movie. It's simply a totally biased and rather amateurish film that twists facts to fit the political message of those involved in its production. Both badly written and poorly directed, the incidents depicted are presented in ways that are not accurate and unfair to both sides of the issues. That being said, the acting is actually rather passable and those playing significant roles are quite earnest in their work in spite of the stereotypical characterizations in the script. Kevin Durand as the personification of evil, the BART officer involved in the shooting, is an absolute standout. He has absolutely no redeeming qualities and is almost satanic in the film. However, the film has little to say for itself and is a big disappointment. It depends far too much on sensationalism and pure controversy to carry it along rather than presenting an interesting interpretation of a real-life event. Much too preachy and superficial overall and those are tremendous understatements.",negative
Fruitvale Station,"I knew nothing about the true story behind this film before I saw it but Ryan Coogler did an impressive job of telling this controversial story. Coogler takes us to the last day in 2008, and introduces us to Oscar Grant's life. A young, troubled father that is trying to do the right thing by his family. This was his debut at Sundance and he didn't disappoint. The audience laughed when the actors laughed and shed tears when the actors shed tears...it was a very moving film. By the end of the film I felt as though I knew these people personally. The whole cast did an excellent job! I'm looking forward to hearing more about Ryan Coogler in the future.",positive
True Story,"""True Story"" is an adaptation of a book in which the author tries desperately to make himself interesting. He isn't. The screenwriters tried equally desperately to make this movie interesting. It's not.Apparently, Mike Finkel fancies himself Truman Capote. Without the journalistic integrity. The ""True Story"" movie viewing experience mirrors Finkel's true story: 100 minutes in the dark waiting for something to happen. Nothing does. Not in Finkel's real life and not in this film.For the most part we are treated to Longo (James Franco) being inscrutable without a hint of creepy. Jill (Felicity Jones) being concerned about Finkel without a hint of passion. Finkel (Jonah Hill) being ... I have no idea what he was being. Hill didn't seem to, either. At one point he gets really, REALLY upset. Possibly to awaken audience members who've fallen asleep.Is this all this nothing masquerading as drama the director's fault? The actors seem to be animated in other films. The script is doing the best it can. The set design is fine, the photography quite good.

I am not going to recap the entire summary of the film, as if you are reading this, chances are you already know it, and if you don't, the less you know the better. I just finished researching the true story of the film, and it appears this film is quite close to the truth. (Unlike the characters in the film)This is a movie about deception involving characters that fabricate the truth to incredible lengths and spin endless webs of lies. One character to a lesser extent to the other, but I found it interesting how this film portrayed the similarities between these two men. The story is brilliantly woven, and extreme attention to detail is paid. The cinematography is beautiful, the acting is solid, this is just all around an exceptionally well made film. It's tragic, yet very thought provoking. The main two complaints I heard in critical reviews were that the film lacked suspense, and that it was a whole lot of buildup with no payoff. The no payoff criticism concerned me the most, as I can't stand movies like that, and that criticism seemed to be the biggest people were making. Realize going in, this is a psychological drama/thriller. I personally was riveted and in constant psychological suspense, but there isn't any real physical suspense throughout the film. The suspense comes from a psychological place, falling victim to the constant mind games, and not knowing what the truth really is. And as for the biggest criticism, that there wasn't any payoff, I couldn't disagree more. I'd like to ask these critics to their face - how much more payoff are you looking for? Given the details of the true events, there isn't any more payoff that could have been provided, in fact, I felt the payoff of this film to be big. It was a psychologically riveting experience that provided a lot to think about long after the end credits rolled.",positive
Professor Marston & the Wonder Women,"This film is a shallow and inaccurate depiction of someone's fantasy. It has little to do with Dr. Marston's life and the creation of Wonder Women. For a well researched history of this topic see Jill Lepore's work, The Secret History of Wonder Women.Wikipedia says, ""In an interview with Mark Walters, William Moulton Marston's granddaughter Christie Marston stated that the film is historically inaccurate. She said that the creators of the film did not contact her family and that the ""depiction of the family and Wonder Woman's origins are made up"". She also posted a statement on Twitter saying that ""the film is not a true story. It is based on someone's imagination not in any way related to my family."" In another interview with Rob Salkowitz for Forbes, Marston argues against two aspects of the film. The first lies in the depiction of the Elizabeth and Olive: ""The relationship between Gram, Elizabeth Marston, and Dots, Olive Byrne, is wrong; they were as sisters, not lovers."" The second part revolves around the depiction of the origin of Wonder Woman, which has ""William Moulton Marston presenting an idea for a female hero, and Elizabeth nay saying the idea, declaring that nobody would ever publish it."" Christie Marston states instead that when her grandfather was asked by his publisher to create a comic character, he ""went home and discussed it with my grandmother. She said to go ahead and do it, but that it had to be a woman."" Marston further elaborates on Elizabeth and Olive by stating that she spent a lot of time with her open-minded grandmother who never gave indication to her of a relationship with Olive. She also states that Elizabeth and Olive continued to share the responsibilities for bringing up the four children in the household after Marston's death because it was economically viable for both women. Christie Marston repeated and elaborated upon these statements in an op-ed for the Hollywood Reporter. It is appalling to me that someone would capitalize on the revolutionary work done by Dr. Marston and misrepresent it so badly.",negative
Professor Marston & the Wonder Women,"Fantastic film. But not as sexual as the advertisements promised. In fact, apart from the curse words, this film should be rated PG-13 at best. I found it surprisingly chaste.The first thing you should know is that this film is NOT based on the book, The Secret History of Wonder Woman. It is based on original research by the director/writer of the movie, who did a great job interpreting the story her own way. It's a story about what happens when you defy convention! And the good that can come of it.Is it factual? Mostly, yes. Kinkiness and BDSM is in the book as well (just read it), not to mention the early comics of Wonder Woman. Anyone denying the lesbian/BDSM content of the real story and the BDSM content of the comic ... is in denial. Sadly, the granddaughter of William Moulton Marston has campaigned to destroy the film, enlisting the support of conservatives and anti-gay people (of which there are many) to spread the word about how the movie is ""fake."" But what's fake? It's a fictional retelling, not a documentary, based on a true story. Fake is the show, Fargo, which claims to be based on actual events, but is completely made up. But no one seems to make a big deal about that. Why? No BDSM or lesbian content in it -- so it's perfectly fine? I think certain people need to acknowledge their own prejudice.Anway, I thought the actors were solid. The director did a great job telling an unconventional story. This is a movie for adults, obviously. I could see this film as a theater piece -- a Broadway play -- actually -- particularly those dress-up scenes with the Frenchman, Charles Guyette, the ""G-String King."" Very theatrical indeed.",positive
King of Thieves,"This film was funny and performances were outstanding. Great directing and writing based on true events. Not sure what everyone's whining about, this film was an awesome geriatric film! Don't listen to the wannabe critics, this film is plain fun and entertaining! A well deserved 8/10 from me.",negative
King of Thieves,"Compare and contrast, if you will, two 2018 cinematic releases that are based upon actual events.Bart Layton's American Animals, is a tale of young impressionable college students who, by way of an attempted heist at their own University library, aimed to get rich quick whilst simultaneously making a name for themselves, whereas James Marsh's King of Thieves, chronicles the still relatively fresh-in-the-memory events of the jewellery heist that transpired down on London's Hatton Garden, back in 2015.Whilst both films are similar in their subject matter, it's the manner in which the respective protagonists go about their nefarious deeds that couldn't be any more different.In Layton's American Animals, a combination of anxiety, lack of experience and a general naivety ultimately prove to be the boys' undoing, whereas Michael Caine and his grizzly cohorts couldn't really have been any more lackadaisical in their approach if they'd tried.At least that's how they're depicted.Just how close to the truth such a depiction actually is, only Brian, Basil, Billy, Terry, Danny and John will know. And that is of course assuming that they've somehow managed to watch Marsh's film from behind the bars of their respective prison cells.One would suspect that they probably have.Authentic depiction or not, one thing is certain, King of Thieves is high on entertainment, and in Michael Caine, Michael Gambon, Jim Broadbent, Ray Winstone and Tom Courtenay, Marsh's film boasts a stella cast portraying masterfully this long-in-the-tooth gang of career criminals. Lock Stock and Six Smoking Pensioners.... And Charlie Cox... if you will.Just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?Admittedly it is possibly a little harsh to lump Paul Whitehouse into that pensioner bracket together with the rest of Dad's Army. Mr Whitehouse, at a mere sixty tender years of age, is after all a good decade or so younger than the majority of his fellow cast members here. Then again, he does now officially qualify for a free bus pass. So, let's just say he's in on a technicality.We digress...Perhaps it's down to the casting of so many recognisable 'national treasures' in Marsh's film, but there's definitely a generous sense of empathy that's generated towards this 'loveable' gang of rogues as they go about their business with their collective carefree, bordering on languid approach to the task.Been there, seen it, done it.Oh, but how things change when the cracks begin to appear and the problems mount up, laying bare the rather ugly traits of greed, power and duplicity for all to see.Indeed, it's quite the transformation watching the likes of serial nice guy Jim Broadbent morph from a cuddly old bugger into something of a devious back stabber, though this is not exactly new territory for Broadbent if one casts one's mind back far enough. His tremendous portrayal of uber-snide Detective Chief Inspector Roy Slater in John Sullivan's timeless sitcom, Only Fools and Horses, remains to this day one of his most convincing and memorable roles.Though it arguably lacks a little 'oomph', in certain places, King of Thieves is nevertheless tremendous fun, with a strong emphasis on the comedic element of what, presumably, would have actually been a very serious undertaking for all involved.What King of Thieves may lack in pace and energy it more than makes up for by way of the on-screen chemistry between the cast members who, it's unimaginable to consider, weren't having an absolute blast in making this film.Not a classic by any means, but one that will probably sufficiently please both fans of the heist movie genre and nostalgia buffs, alike.This and hundreds of other films are reviewed on my WaywardWolfBlog",positive
Welcome to Marwen,"I'll make this brief. While there is some very interesting photography and cinematographic turns, and, a very good performance by Steve Carell in a thankless role, this film is a very sanitized retelling of a true story.
To everyone here with the 8-10 star reviews who can't figure out why the movie was pilloried by critics, watch the original documentary, MARWENCOL.
Given the jarring disconnect between the tenor of this film and the true reality of the documentary, I'm very surprised that Carell took the role..",negative

Foxcatcher,"FOXCATCHER is a film that is easier to admire than to love, and I mean that in the best way possible. While the slow and deliberate pacing will put a lot of people off, its disturbing subject matter, psychological depth and outstanding performances make it fascinating, if not riveting. For those unaware of what the story is about (like I was), the film mostly revolves around Mark and David Schultz, two Olympic gold medal-winning wrestlers who become involved with eccentric millionaire (billionaire?) John Du Pont, specifically in preparation for the 1988 World Championship and Seoul Olympics. But wrestling is just the conduit for a deep character study of people who looked to overcome personal weakness by achieving greatness. It's really hard to say who gives the best performance out of the three leads because all of them do so well. Mark Ruffalo (who plays Dave Schultz) usually does well, and this is no exception. Steve Carell was barely recognizable as the eccentric Du Pont, greatly aided by prosthetics in his physical transformation, but also quite different in the way he spoke and carried himself compared with what roles he usually plays. I suppose the biggest surprise of them all is Channing Tatum (playing Mark Schultz) who manages to hold his own against these other two acting greats. Although he didn't have a whole lot of dialogue (and really, the film as a whole doesn't), the physicality he brought to the role was incredible in its own right. As for the wrestling scenes, they were shot well, if unspectacular. Basically they did what they needed to do for the narrative, i.e., serve as guideposts so that one didn't get lost in the pacing (and also because they were factual). What interested me the most, though, was the curious relationship that develops between John Du Pont and Mark Schultz. Du Pont takes Mark under his wing, provides him with living quarters, a training facility, and pays him, yet his status as the team coach (and quite a rich one at that) makes it where the relationship is rather one-sided. In real life, John Du Pont was the black sheep of his family and a very lonely man, and taking on Mark Schultz was a way for him to indulge in his interests and to have a friend. Now, as interesting as I find true crime, there usually has to be some stylistic choice or a scene or two which get to me in an emotional way, and this film has that as well. Both of these scenes are dialogue-free and are scored using Arvo Part's ""Fur Alina,"" a hauntingly minimal piano piece which I recently discovered. To me, these scenes (which I won't spoil) perfectly capture the film's melancholy tone. And in general, the score is rather tasteful. Often, the sound design will completely take a back seat and certain scenes will play out free of dialogue with a sort of humming that brings a subtle intensity and a growing sense of dread. Overall, FOXCATCHER is an excellent, dark character study that features some great performances and an ending that will shock you even if you see it coming. Highly recommended, as long you have a good attention span.",negative
Foxcatcher,"When you see Steve Carell in a movie, you expect him to be the funniest thing in a movie. When you see Channing Tatum, you expect him to be buff, and be the hot hero of the movie. When you see Mark Ruffalo, you expect to see comedy-drama movies, and he's just a side character. With Foxcatcher, you see none of those. Instead, you see a very ominous picture. The musical score is scarcely used, which makes it even better. The best part of the picture, no doubt, is Steve Carell as John E. DuPont. Holy Hell! He was frightening just to look at. And him talking without yelling is actually what sells it. Channing Tatum was absolutely phenomenal as Mark Schultz. Not only did he nail the role perfectly, he took it to the next level, and actually managed to even stay in character even when he injured himself with the mirror. Mark Ruffalo was rather quiet as Dave Schultz, but even then, it's necessary for the character development. Bennett Miller's Foxcatcher is an underrated gem that people overlooked. With a sports movie, you get to know the players of the team, you have them lose first, but along the way they win the games, and eventually come closer as a team and family. With Foxcatcher, none of that happens. Instead, you get a chronological series of events, and Steve Carell being rather reclusive toward his team, and his mother, played by Vanessa Redgrave. It doesn't have you watching, and enjoying it. It has you watching a reality with actors, who are usually cast in stereotypical roles, breaking that streak, and having the people they're playing come out instead of them. This movie easily made it to my top 20 list.",positive
Marshall,"The movie looks like a schoolproject.
Lot's off weird handheld camera angles.

She feels really outta place. Like she har ni choice starring in this movie? Why not a horror movie instead?

Can You Ever Forgive Me?,"I saw this film at the San Diego film festival this weekend. What a wonderful story that needed to be told. Morality aside, lee Israel was a genius. The only crimes were committed by the people who fell for it. A quirky black comedy everyone will enjoy, but still full of emotion and heart. Not a lot more I can say, just a great film.",negative
Can You Ever Forgive Me?,"Melissa McCarthy is not known for her dramatic roles, but this film might change that. It's the gripping story of Lee Israel, a struggling Manhattan writer who in the early 1990s undertook the extraordinary step of falsifying letters from famous people to make ends meet.McCarthy is an eye-opener here as the hard-drinking, acid-tongued Israel, a miserable middle-aged woman who sought friendship in precious few souls, one of them being a mysterious figure on the Upper West Side portrayed with fierce verve by Richard E. Grant, who winds up becoming something of an accomplice to her enterprise. She is desperate to pay her bills. His murky story becomes more known as the film progresses. The two of them are an odd couple, as they both have setbacks and misery to look back upon, but their pessimism and misanthrope are not equally shared.This film will offer a glimpse of nostalgia for anyone who remembers New York in a now quaint era, when struggling writers still lived as adults in Manhattan, when life was endearingly bleak and bookstores were not yet massive chains. That sense of atmosphere I greatly admire. Recommended to anyone who enjoys a scathing story of literary scheming.",positive
Wild,"Fans of Cheryl Strayed likely come away from this movie feeling reasonably content with the outcome. There's no challenge to the end product or hope for anything more. Reese Witherspoon is a pretty personification that many can put their hopes and dreams and selves into and flutter away to the pretty pictures of mountains for a few fleeting moments in their day. For the rest of us, however, the movie is quite unmemorable and intangible. If anything, we simply watch Strayed (Witherspoon) walk around like an entitled, annoyed bitch for two hours, getting into trouble, doing stupid things, hurting anyone close to her, and then crying over spill milk again and again. And all along there's this audacious overtone telling us we should be feeling sorry for Strayed and her struggles give me a break.It's clear Jean-Marc Vallee wanted to produce an Oscar-season prospect, not an accurate or truly vulnerable adaptation. Coming off his success with Dallas Buyers Club, Vallee wanted to shift momentum to a prettier landscape and fill in the rest with exhausting flashbacks for back story. I can visualize what he was aiming for, and it could have been a shoe-in for best picture or certainly best actress. Unfortunately the end product missed the target by thousands of miles. Wild is tiresome, disjointed and certainly not Oscar-worthy material. The big difference between the two films is that Dallas was based on a tremendous story, one of transformation and growth, which is why it resonated so well with audiences. Wild is not a tremendous story, not even a good one, and simply takes the same approach as another vain diatribe, ""Eat Pray Love."" Essentially, a struggling female writer feels trapped in her life and decides to try something extreme, get herself out of this rut and find purpose (then shockingly decides to write a book about it and capitalize off all the people who want to do the same. CRAZY!). I won't argue that Strayed didn't have a rough go at it. With the death of her mother, her rotten coping mechanisms through anonymous sex and heroin use, the consequent failure of her marriage and the downward spiral of her life, Strayed was headed nowhere before she found the path of the PCT. But that does not excuse how ego-driven and basic Wild is (and is told).Strayed is the ugliest character in the story. Aside from a terrible voice-over at the end (seriously, WTF was that?), Strayed truly does not change physically, emotionally or in her relationships from beginning to end. Yet somehow the film goes out of its way to make her a hero, innocent and a victim in this crazy world around her. We see this when all the rangers, hikers, townsfolk, even customers at the diner she's waiting at all want to rape her or take advantage. Apparently every man in the 90s was absolutely horrible (even the husband she was cheating on who drove across the country to fetch her out of a drug den and save her life. Hrm). The most ironic part is how Strayed described in the book that she wanted to sleep with nearly every man that crossed her path (including most men on the trail), and at times she said she had to hold herself back. And that's the worst part of Wild, the blatant, phony feminist propaganda. Feminism is so trendy in pop culture right now that everyone is claiming they're a part of the cause. But it's a word that is completely misappropriated and misused, especially by quite terrible role models such as Cheryl Strayed. She is a woman who wants to desperately be considered a feminist that she adjusts her story to justify her mistakes, even throwing in the line, ""I am a feminist,"" into the movie to frantically convince us. But she's not. Being a selfish, inconsiderate asshole doesn't make you a feminist or a martyr. It makes you a selfish, inconsiderate asshole, and not a person the viewer should want to feel compassion for.To be honest, one of the best parts of the book was the relationships and perspectives of others who Strayed came across on the trail. We got to hear what they were going through, not just getting hit over the head by a whiny Witherspoon. Yet the theatrical version (again) only focuses on Cheryl and her theoretical struggle with life (i.e. herself). We totally skip over all the other people who in my opinion were the 'therapists' and friends who helped Cheryl to grow and guide her change into a new woman and move beyond her horrible past.If the story is intended to be one about personal growth and finding oneself, then there is none of that here in this adaptation. For a 15-minute montage Reese is bitching and moaning about hiking and her life, then suddenly we're at the end of the trek and she's telling us about how happy-ever-after things are going to be in the future. It was like Vallee just said, ""I'm over it,"" and decided to end the terrible experiment. By the end of this movie I find myself really caring less about Strayed (even distrusting her more since she signed off on this thing), and I'm insulted by her story and embarrassed that so many embrace her and what she did as some sort of feminist martyrdom. I think Strayed was a stupid girl who did stupid things, and out of sheer blonde luck was able to survive a trek on her own. Even more luck, she was able to turn that mediocre story into millions of dollars in her pocket. So good for her. It's not a terrible movie, just a terrible story about a terrible person who wants us all to believe she's a saint. I don't buy it, and unfortunately I rented the movie and bought the book.",negative
Wild,"I am the daughter of a mother who recently passed away from lung cancer. She never smoked, like the protagonist mother. I cried many times during this movie. It made me think a lot because like the lead character, i often ruminate over the past; i have a lot of flashbacks and memories of my mother keep replaying in my head., and the things she said to me will forever echo in my brain. In terms of the sex and the drug taking, i think Resse did very well in portraying the daughter who completely lost herself and the desire to live with the loss of her mother. I also grew up in a single household and my mother and I were always together, our identity are intertwined; it was us against the world. Losing our mother is like losing more than life itself, I am still finding myself lost and struggling to find meaning in life. It is a constant struggle to not give up and give into self destruction and I am very thankful that the protagonist captured this feeling very well.Like the life of a lot of people, this movie is about the journey we take. Its not about the destination or achieving a particular purpose. It is deeply realistic, and i am glad it doesn't lecture or give a moral lesson on how we should be ,or a happy ending because we don't always get that in life. Life is ugly and it doesn't always end in happiness and things don't always happen for a reason good people do not always get a good ending and normal people can do bad things to themselves and to toh others due to pain brought on by unbearable grief. This movie inspires me to maybe run a marathon.Walking, hiding and running are very meditative and its like a metaphor for life, no matter what happened, all we can do is keep walking.",positive
Straight Outta Compton,"I am not a big fan of N.W.A and their music does not interest me. I have to admit that after seeing this movie I was overwhelmed with dismay. It is true that the media and the movie critics have been slanting the news to trap us into seeing this film.Alas what a boring film!.From the beginning to end,this documentary movie about five black rappers failed to impress me.Off course this movie deserves a fair NC17 rating,but the explicit sex and the bad language did not offend me since I am an adult.What I strongly hated about this movie is that it indirectly promotes racism and hatred against black people for in this movie are represented as ruthless and immoral rebels .Sorry to tell you that (Straight Outta Compton) is a movie you should avoid if you do not want to waste your time and lose your money.",negative
Straight Outta Compton,"I've been writing reviews for IMDb for ten years, and I think something fishy is going on here. STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is getting very, very high reviews from the vast majority of IMDb reviewers -- but the nine and ten- star reviews are all getting pelted with ""negative"" marks, earning scores of ""1 out of 15"" likes.So what's the problem? The problem is that this movie wasn't supposed to be a hit. The mass audience wasn't supposed to respond to the story of young black men facing oppression and coming out on top. The American people were not supposed to see the real truth about how their police treat minorities every day. Quick, let's bury the good reviews! Let's spawn a phony backlash! Let's discredit Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on the basis of things they did twenty years ago. Oh, and let's all get sentimental about Eazy E because he's dead, and young black men are okay once they're dead. The dead ones are no longer scary and threatening. The problem with this movie is that the people who made it actually dared to portray young, angry black men as heroic, not as criminals or predators. It's okay to glamorize white criminals, because Hollywood was built on that. From PUBLIC ENEMY to THE GODFATHER, white audiences have always loved to sentimentalize their own criminals. But you can't do that with black men who rap about crime, even when they aren't actually criminals themselves. When Cagney postures like a thug in some ancient piece of crap that's cool. But when black men do it today that's dangerous and irresponsible!There are very powerful elements in this country that are terribly frightened by this movie. They're frightened because this movie gets white audiences to see young black men as something other than dangerous criminals. The scenes of NWA being roughed up by police are a terrible threat to the powerful elements in our society, who stay in power only by keeping white people scared of black men. They can't tolerate the idea of black male victims, so they instantly start a media backlash portraying the victims as criminals.I say this is a good movie, a powerful, exciting film that presents a side of American life that is almost never seen on the screen. I know I'm not going to get many likes for this review, but what the hell. I've got enough already.",positive
Dangal,"Dangal has Indian box office record of all time and it deserves it. It is the best biopic Bollywood can make. It has every quality Hollywood biopics have. Cast did an amazing job. Preparing this project as an actor is hard. Aamir Khan's transformation proves that. They brilliantly show us their characters' moods and reactions about every event they have been through. Also, Dangal has great descriptions about public and important social messages. I really respect that. I think it is almost a masterpiece but it miss that by a step. Best thing this movie have is showing us great character motivations and relationships. They made it nicely. Worst thing this movie have is telling wrestling's technical details so superficial. It shows something about that but it doesn't explain.",negative
Dangal,"If I would I've seen this movie in 2016, it certainly would have been in my list of best movies. If you're going to this movie thinking Aamir will be flexing and showcasing his acting prowess then well and good but the girls are the highlight of the movie, hands down. SCRIPT - Major props to bringing out a story which is inspiring and one which India needs right now. The story is kept grounded in reality. No over-the-top gimmicks. The songs blend in very well with the premise. None of the scenes linger on for a long period of time. There was a very natural flow to the story which helped engage the audience for 2 hours and 41 minutes. Even movies like Mary Kom or Bhaag Milkha Bhaag started to drag by the end but hats off to Piyush Gupta and Shreyas Jain. I have said this that dialogue shouldn't seem like dialogue unless it is a musical or a re-imagining of a play. The dialogue in this movie is a lesson as to how dialogue should be used. Little nods and grunts and expressions serve more than an explanatory conversation. I am not a fan of narration and I wasn't really liking it here either. It was fine for the light-hearted scenes but the serious scenes required silence but I can give it a pass. The only scene which felt a bit off is where Mahavir gets locked up in a room before the final fight. If it didn't happen in reality then it was really unnecessary. DIRECTION - Chillar Party was a movie with some serious message but was a little preachy and Bhootnath Returns went full preachy. Nitesh Tiwari toned down that preaching to a very natural level in this movie. Every single topic that has happened or still happens in a family was touched upon. Beginning from the sleaziness of men to child-marriage to the sacrifice parents make, everything was utilised to the advantage of the movie. None of that brought the movie to a halt. The first half of the movie had a good amount of comedy and that gelled into the second half with ease. The thing that many might not notice that there are no pay-off scenes except for the last scene. If the audience reaches a peak before the ending then the pay-off wouldn't have a solid effect, if used multiple times. Pay-off scenes are those scenes where the characters are shown to be doing things in extra slow-motion to have an orgasmic effect on the audience and the director cleverly used it at the end in order to give proper tribute to the art and the character. FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY - This section needed a category of it's own and quite deservedly. I saw Mary Kom, Sultan and Saala Khadoos which had extensive fight scenes and all of the movies had extremely lack-lustre fight scenes. The camera moved too much in order to cover up the actor/actresses' incapability to fight. In comparison to all those movies, here the camera just followed the fighters. No wide-shots of the fight from the audience's perspective because that allows the stunt double to come in. All the fights had the actresses in the scene and hats off to all of them for their dedication. ACTING - Like I said before, the best performance among some amazing performances was of the newcomer Fatima Sana Shaikh. That said, it will really be unjust to name one performance as the best performance because everyone was amazing in this movie. Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Sanya Malhotra, Aparshakti Khurana,Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar,Ritwik Shore and Girish Kulkarni gave amazing performances. As Aamir had put on so much weight, that altered his physicality a lot which enhanced his performance to another level. Sakshi Tanwar should be doing more movies. She gave a very subdued and nuanced performance. Sanya Malhotra as the grown up Babita had very few scenes but her eyes spoke when she didn't have any dialogue. Zaira Wasim and Sulhani Bhatnagar were awesome, just awesome. I was in awe how they are able to emote so much at their age. Ritwik Shore and Aparshakti Khurana together made Omkar a memorable character. I think they had some of the best scenes in the entire movie. I wanted to kill Girish Kulkarni after Ugly and after this I still want to kill him and that's a compliment. The side actors who formed the audience and little roles like the Dangal organiser and the guy who had sleazy theatre also gave substance to the movie. FINAL VERDICT - I am sure everyone has seen this movie by now and if you haven't then please do. It's a complete movie and it is very rare to see a complete movie, without gimmicks nowadays. I loved how they had such eye for detail because they gave that damaged effect to Aamir's ear. Many wouldn't notice it but it's great to that they did to provide authenticity to the character and the movie. It's a 10/10 for me and one of the best movies of 2016.",positive

We also get to know Brendan, a doped-out loser whose girlfriend just got pregnant. Realizing he needs to turn his life around, Brendan applies to join the fire squad and for reasons unknown until much later in the movie, Eric decides to give Brendan a shot. In a parallel story, we also get to know Eric;s wife Amanda, a horse whisperer. But not all is well in their marriage... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from up-and-coming director Joseph Kosinski, who previously directed ""Ton: Legacy"" and ""Oblivion"". In his latest, he steers away from sci-fi and instead brings us the incredible story of the Prescott, AZ wild fire squad, nicknamed the Granite Mountain Hot Shots. I expected a disaster movie, and there is certainly that too, but the movie does much more than that: it brings the story of a group of people in a way that you are completely emotionally invested in those people, and you CARE. Kosinski directs an all-star cast, headed by Josh Brolin as Eric. Is it just me, but Brolin only seems to get better as he is getting older. That guy is just solid and authentic. Miles Teller plays the role of Brendan, an unlikable character at first. Jennifer Connelly is outstanding as Eric's wife Amanda. Taylor Kitsch is one of the guys in the fire squad. In much smaller roles, Jeff Bridges is Duane (Eric's superior), and the ageless Andie MacDowell plays Duane's wife. The movie's photography is eye-candy, and the wild fire scenes, which I imagine are mostly CGI, look very real to me. Last but not least, there is a very nice musical score, courtesy of composer Joseph Trapanese (who has worked with Kosinski before).""Only the Brave"" opened wide this weekend, and I was really looking forward to seeing it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended only so-so (less than half a fairly small theater), somewhat to my surprise, given the stellar critical acclaim this movie has been getting. I can only speak for myself, but I found this to be an outstanding wild fire disaster movie that packs an emotional wallop I didn't expect. I encourage you to check out ""Only the Brave"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",negative
Only the Brave,"Personally I found nothing wrong with this movie which is something I rarely say when I go to the theaters now days. The cast was great and really got you interested in the characters. It stayed mostly true to the actual story of these brave men whilst throwing in a little bit more drama and action to ""Hollywood"" it. The ending will have you shedding a tear even though we all knew what happens going into it. Was well worth the money spent and deserves a higher rating than critics have given it.",positive
The Banker,"Samuel L was excellent, it was well acted, it was on mission, the film
kind of gripped... then lost that grip with an abrupt ending. Worth the watch
though.",negative
The Banker,It was a powerful film and the actors did their part quite nicely. don't understand the low ratings on this.,positive
Diana,"Diana is a complete and utter catastrophe.Instead of taking the most interesting aspects of Princess Diana's life and revolving a sort of character study around them, this movie chose the easy route. It's a romantic film about a rich person who falls in love with another rich person and one of them just so happens to be Princess Diana.Our title character is played by Naomi Watts, a fine actress with many profound roles under her belt, but sadly she is just no good as Diana. While they certainly got the hair and wardrobe correct, she just can't BE Princess Diana. The character is horribly written, selfish, manipulative and surprisingly stupid with no sense of presence or dynamic sensibility, it really is some of the worst romantic movie writing ever put to screen. Even if Watts had given the best performance of her life, it still wouldn't have made the character a convincing movie heroine.Romantic interest Hasnat Khan is the only interesting or dynamic character in the whole movie. This is a man who's torn between his heart, his job, his faith and his family, but the horrible screenplay only serves to have him whine endlessly. The actor is really trying to make something work here but the script is just too much of a quagmire of clichés and melodrama.Director Oliver Hirschbiegel who made the fantastic Downfall back in 2004 achieved the impossible, he made you sympathise with the Nazis. Through intense drama and character building he achieved a real intensity of characters working through strife. But this film is completely missing anything that made Downfall the masterpiece that it is, this movie feels like something made for television.After viewing Diana I had a thought, perhaps it was impossible to make a convincing biopic about Princess Diana, perhaps it was hubris to ever try. By glossing over everything that made her life so pronounced (her relationship and breakup with Prince Charles, her humanitarian work and eventually the suspicious circumstances around her death) it made the work incredibly dull, but perhaps if they did involve the more risqué occurrences it would have made controversy impossible to avoid.",negative
Diana,"I hardly write reviews but the average rating of this movie forced and compelled me to sign in and write one for this one. I have been waiting for this one since its production days and now that I finally managed to watch it, I am really surprised to see it has been rated so low on average. The film is great and I loved it. Naomi has done a wonderful job especially with her expressions and her accent. She did justice to the character. Nobody other could have done Diana's character in such a magnificent, delicate and magnificent way. It was because of this movie that I was so touched that I watched Diana's interview with BBC once again after so many years. I compared Naomi's impressions of Diana during that very interview and she was just amazing. It's a beautiful film and the cast has done an amazing job. It doesn't happen very often that the admirers and fans of a famous personality can be pleased by someone else by being the same. Naomi did that successfully.",positive
Sully,"I thought ""Sully"" got off to a bit of a slow start. I remember the incident well from news reports - Captain Sullenberger landing the massive Airbus A320 in the Hudson River just a few minutes after takeoff because of dual engine failures - and everyone surviving the incident. It sounds like an exciting story, but it's made pretty clear from the start that this is going to be far more about the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board than about the incident itself. Which, I suppose, is understandable. As is pointed out several times in the movie, the entire incident lasted about 208 seconds. You can't really make a movie about a 208 second incident. And, indeed, for the first little while this movie had me a bit disoriented, wondering what really was going on. But the story picks up its pace well, and in the end director Clint Eastwood did a magnificent job of moving back and forth from the narrative about the investigation to what actually happened in the cockpit - and the cockpit scenes were dramatic and seemingly (to me, admittedly a non-pilot) meticulously recreated - as was the ultimate evacuation of the plane afterward. It really was a tribute not just to Sully, but to all of the flight crew, who acted professionally and calmly and ensured the survival of their passengers.The NTSB didn't come across quite as well. Sullenberger became (understandably) a hero almost from the moment this happened. After all, it happened in broad daylight in one of the world's largest cities - lots of people saw it. The depiction of the NTSB investigators was that they were antagonistic toward Sully, perhaps either disturbed or jealous that his media acclaim was getting way ahead of their work, and they came across as people looking to place blame for the incident rather than people who were looking for the truth. The actual investigators disputed how they were portrayed, and my understanding is that even Sullenberger disagreed with the liberties that the writers and Eastwood took with this part of the story. I suppose there was a feeling that a movie has to have a ""bad guy"" to create dramatic tension - and the NTSB filled that role perfectly, even if the portrayal was unfair.Tom Hanks is obviously the star of this movie. Aaron Eckhart is along for the ride as Scully's co-pilot, Jeff Skiles, but everything in this movie focuses on Hanks. His performance, I thought, was predictably excellent. It's an understated performance - not high on typical drama or excitement, but portraying Sully as a naturally humble man who finds himself thrust into the spotlight and tormented by the thought that he could have done something different - something safer - although it's made clear that for all his thoughts about alternatives in the end he's confident that he made the right decision - the evidence for that being that all 155 people on the plane survived.Ultimately, after that slow start that lasted for maybe 15 or 20 minutes when the movie seemed a bit off focus, this turned out to be an excellent story of a man who is, indeed, a real hero. (8/10)",negative
Sully,"I am one of the lucky few who had the opportunity to get an advance premier screening for Sully at AMC IMAX Somerville, Boston ten days prior to the release.This is easily the best movie of 2016. I have been following the Jan 15 controlled ditching incident of US Airways Flight 1549 case for a while. Everything about this case was covered on TV and the hearings are uploaded on YouTube. I have watched nearly 5 hours of the footage on YouTube and I was skeptical before the film whether if it offers us anything new.I was mind-blown; the movie is truly an untold story. The drama, action and intensity is all along. It left me and many audience in tears. It feels realistic in the IMAX edition with great sound effects surrounding you. The screenplay of this film is unique, Client Eastwood is an outstanding director has outdone himself with this gripping tale.Tom hanks has been the heart of the film. The acting was top notch. I am sure his meetings with Chesley SUllenberger must have contributed something in the acting department. Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Skiles also did a great job with his subtle humor and great screen presence. He makes you wanting more of the character.Coming back to the facts, Client Eastwood has left what we all know because of the footages shown in YouTube and the hearings. Overall, great performances, superb screenplay, neat editing and fabulous visual and audio effects make this film easily the best in 2016.Above all, this one has a heart!9/10",positive
Tolkien,"Tolkien is a biopic about the early life of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy/The Hobbit author J.R.R. Tolkien. Starring Nicholas Hoult in the lead role, it is a well-intended, yet muddled look at the acclaimed author's legacy.As a young man, John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (Nicholas Hoult) befriends a group of three outcasts at school who help him to find his place in the world and support him in his creative endeavours. Over time, John meets Edith Bratt (Lily Collins), a young pianist with whom he falls in love and becomes his muse. Eventually, however, World War I breaks out and John is sent off to fight in the trenches at the Battle of the Somme, separating him from some of his friends and the love of his life.Despite a solid premise, Tolkien ultimately struggles to elevate its intriguing subject matter above merely being another outcast author. The film chooses to omit important details about Tolkien, such as his strong Christian faith influencing his writings, instead opting for a more fantasy driven approach. In addition to this, the pacing is painfully slow most of the time, showcasing some of the least interesting aspects of what inspired Tolkien to write his novels in the first place. With that said, the film is at least nice to look at thanks to some creative cinematography during Tolkien's musings and Nicholas Hoult's well-acted performance in the title role. It's a shame that so much overall effort was put in to producing so little of interest.I rate it 6/10",negative
Tolkien,"Given the extraordinary power, popularity and (literally) ""magic"" of both books and movies, we are obviously in need of explorations of Tolkien's life and creativity, even as we know that you can't make a film out of a biographical book (of which there are several in this case - each of 300-400 pages), and even as we know that a person of brilliance and imagination flowing through the pen does not necessarily (though may) have a brilliant and imaginative life.Ultimately, Tolkien was a language expert at British Universities (notably Oxford), though his early life (to which this film devotes itself) was not dull, even if it was not untypical for the late 19th and early 20th centuries in featuring imperially-motivated travel/adventure, disease, death and bereavement, uncomfortable schooldays and - of course, in time - war with a capital W.Indeed, one of the greatest achievements of this work by Cypriot-born Finnish Director Dome Karukoski is its instinctive, near-visceral feel for the times. Edwardian mores are injected into the content, and they go so perfectly hand in hand with omnipresent scientific, but also pre-Raphaelite and Arts&Crafts-type influences, history and modernity coming up against one another. Maybe the movie is almost trite in doing this, but it seems meaningful to suggest that the Hobbit, LOTR and the rest were near-inevitabilities for the boy and man we learn a little about, in the time and place and circumstances he found himself.Tolkien always denied that his work was over-influenced by World War One, even if none of us out here really accept that - yet the film (which the Tolkien estate and family had no truck with) does indeed build a kind of case that every aspect of the author's life pushed him through to what he achieved. Surely the War was in there, but so was young friendship, young love, loss of parents at a tender age, and a strong urge to become learned and expert in subjects that mattered to the man.An ironic conclusion from this would be that the works were great, not just because the man was great, but because his times were. Of course, WWI was hateful in almost every way - as this movie makes abundantly clear - yet men (including several I myself spoke to) said ""I wouldn't have missed it for the world, for the camaraderie"". And in the end, both of Tolkien's great works are stories of loyalty and companionship in the face of suffering and danger.The centrepiece here - though really only sketched out rather impressionistically - is the so-called ""Tea Club, Barrovian Society"" of 4 (we see 4, though there were a few more) clever and imaginative boys who pushed the artistic and behavioural boundaries just a little, in the actually very serene and safe surroundings of the cafe at Barrows exclusive department store in Birmingham (England).Just re-read that last line in all its enigmatic, eccentric and ridiculous glory, then imagine the same people (still not much more than boys) in the Trenches or (in the case of Christopher Wiseman) in the Royal Navy. Only Tolkien and Wiseman came back, and Tolkien not entirely ""whole"" for some time.The acting in the parts of the boys here is quite good enough, and Derek Jacobi works his usual magic as linguist Prof. Joseph Wright (in real life an academic of humble origins who got to study at Heidelberg but walked there from Antwerp in order to save the fare money!)But this whole piece is so somehow ""instinctive"" that individual acted parts don't seem to matter too much. Our star in the form of ""Cumberbatch Junior"" Nicholas Hoult does not seem to give too much away, and certainly looks too young for the later scenes; but the wonderful, devout and devoted love portrayed between the young Ronald and his Edith (played by the ever-mesmerising Lily Collins) is well-done and certainly has its on-screen chemistry. Sad that the truth had to be departed from in places - the couple had already married (in March 1916) by the time Tolkien left to fight in World War One. He had loved her from the age of 16 on (when she was already 19). This is somehow significant, as it is widely felt that the Middle Earth books are not great at dealing with male-female love. Actually, I in the end beg to differ, as I think the developing love between Faramir and Eowyn in LOTR is actually one of the most touching and meaningful portrayals I know of. And since that was love on the back of loss, wounds, war and hopelessness one wonders how autobiographical that too might have been...Perhaps we don't actually need a film to offer us the basic biographical details, but in terms of mood-setting this work is - for me at least - far more than adequate, and in fact rather entrancing. The fact that we see moments of battlefield visions of black riders, orcs and so on as our hero suffers trench fever is a bit of a turn-off, but for me by no means enough to ruin the film.",positive
Jungle,It's a rarity to be able to find a survival movie that is generally boring throughout. But they managed just that. A real shame considering the actors and their performances. I had a hard time staying awake and I'm not one that falls asleep during any movies.,negative
Jungle,"I just caught this film on Amazon Video and I'm kicking myself for not catching this at the movies. I don't think the movie was marketed well when it was released. I was blown away by all aspects of this film and found it hard to hold back my tears towards the end of the film.To an extent it reminded me of Danny Boyle's 127 Hours, but it's a beautifully made film in its own right. It's a survival story so be prepared to see some not so appetising scenes in parts but the pay off is worth it. Towards the end of the film we get to see the real people behind these characters and those photos will stay with you long after you've seen the film. I'd recommend you to seek this one out on the biggest screen you could find.",positive
The Two Popes,"This is quite a clever piece of work. Both performances demonstrate a complex, sometimes conflicted, humanity in a touching and thought-provoking way. Hopkins, as the scholarly Benedict XVI coming to realise that he no longer feels capable - for various reasons - to remain Pontiff and Pryce as Cardinal Bergoglio with whom he has little in common, and who has come to Rome to seek his permission to retire. The story focuses more on the trials and tribulations of Bergoglio as he rises to prominence in the Jesuit order and navigates the political turmoil of Argentina in the 70s and 80s where he develops a much less ""conservative"" approach to the issues facing the Catholic Church than his Pope. By the conclusion, however, both men appear reconciled to the honesty and integrity of the other. The extent to which the detail is true is anyone's guess - but by using humour, sport and even ABBA, this proves to be an intimate observational film that is certainly one of Netflix' better commissions.",negative
The Two Popes,"I'm not a Catholic, and this movie is very, very Catholic. But beyond that, it's one of the deepest cinematic examinations of faith I've ever seen. Sir Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce, playing Pope Benedict XVI and Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio (who later becomes Pope Francis) respectively, both deliver brilliant, finely crafted lines with stellar performances. (It's somewhat ironic that two Welsh actors are playing a German and an Argentenian, but most of the film is spoken in English, so it works out in some strange way.) I really didn't follow the most recent transition between Popes, so I had not expected to be so deeply involved with this movie, but I am very glad to have watched it. Highly recommended for its insightful look into the human condition and the underpinnings of faith with its sometimes wavering texture, even for the most religious of us. Beautifully filmed on location in Argentina and the Vatican. If you subscribe to Netflix, then I suggest you watch this movie tonight.",positive
Joy,"Well, what can I say? Joy is a plain, boring and uneventful movie lacking great performances from Robert de Niro and Jennifer Lawrence (of course I wasn't expecting much from Bradley Cooper). The plot could have been interesting but the script completely ruined it I am not a fan of David Russell bu he did a really really bad job with Joy: his sequences don t make any sense, the narrator character choice is just pointless and many scenes are really hard to believe in. During the initial part of the movie, there were some funny bits which kept me moderately entertained but, after those 30 minutes, it was just plain boredom. The fact that Jennifer Lawrence won a Golden Globe for this is just unbelievable and proves what we all already know and what Ricky Gervais mentioned at the ceremony: all awards are bought by studios as a marketing campaign. Well, they succeeded, because I spent the money to see that, and I could not regret it more than I do.",negative
Joy,"The life story of the self-wringing-mop inventor. A story of a cool headed woman kept doing what she could in her messy life and messy family and beyond.

The grandmother, oh I love her so much! She never lost, never stopped her faith on this granddaughter (not everyone has this kind of person in his/ her life I think). She just knew it, that this one girl would nail it someday, and be the family savior. And the best friend, oh! I love her so much too! Only a true best friend can really know how to help you like she did to the main character here!! And this tough movie is presented prettily. So blessed.

Billionaire Boys Club,"Considering this film's runtime is around 100 minutes it felt more like 4 hours.I struggled to find any of the characters engaging or likeable, and so didn't feel invested in the story. After about an hour (or what felt like three), my attention had waivered to the point I was on my phone looking up the real-life story behind the film.Maybe it's just not my type of movie, so give it a go yourself by all means.

Operation Finale,"Films about Nazis always freak me out, even ones like this where there's a layer of cinematic tint. Dramatic set pieces, overly acted dialogue, rousing score. It feels wrong to dress up Nazi atrocities. Yet despite its heist movie aesthetic, this is worth watching, Oscar Isaac is good, in his Golden Age of Hollywood way. Ben Kingsley though, has played some terrifying characters, but is portrayal of Adolf Eichmann is, well it's disarming. There are much better films that cover this subject, but I'll never decry any that highlights what happened during the Holocaust, the aftermath and present day deniers and anti-semites. Films like this have their place, many people struggle with the realities of what happened and if this makes the truth more accessible, then so be it.",negative

Boy Erased,"I originally gave this film 6 stars because the acting is superb. But the story is terribly understated and actually runs the risk of showing the world that conversion therapy ""doesn't look that bad.""What's depicted is no worse than just another Sunday sermon in the south. Having lived through that, I know. As a physician and LGBTQ rights advocate, I can attest it gets much worse. SO much worse. But we don't see that here. If Garrard Conley endured only the film's version of events, then he's a lucky person indeed.Bottom line: the title is significantly more dramatic than the film itself. A better title would have been Boy Inconvenienced for a Week Maybe (But It's Diffucult To Tell Really Because of the Pacing and Flashbacks).

Boy Erased,"As a parent of a gay man, I believe that this is a must-see film for all parents. It's a stark reminder of what was once widely believed (and sadly still is by too many) about homosexuality. It is said that when a person come out about their sexuality, they risk losing everything they have - their families, their friends, their homes... When I learned this, I realized that my son went through the same horrific fears a he prepared to come out. No one should have to endure that kind of suffering. I hope this film helps people realize that we have to continue to banish the old, harmful, and false beliefs that our society held. Amazing accomplishment by Joel Edgerton.",positive

Now i read some Of the reviews and it angers me that no one mentions how good muse was, cause his acting, along with Tom hanks Of course, was what really made me love this. I later found out he was nominated for an Oscar and i calmed Down again, aha. But seriously watch this movie, it strangely made me cry, because the idea Of it happening in real life, which it did, really frightens me.

Captain Phillips,"That went a lot higher than my expectations. I was thinking an okay movie, but that was more than just okay. Truly impressive powerful thriller.The movie's strength points could be summed up:1. Greengrass's thrillers are really fine, I like his The Bourne Ultimatum with his shaky camera tricks. And here he is doing it again maybe with different techniques. As a thriller, Greengrass managed to make this movie get on your nerves and put so much tension, and that's a success.2. The Somali crew.. Now, that's some serious impressive sh*t. Some Somali dudes you have never seen their faces in a movie before come and make such spectacular performances, that's something you should admire. It made the movie so believable that you'd sometimes forget it's just a movie. Barkhad Abdi has made a huge step in his career with this movie and that was crowned by his nomination for the best actor in a supporting role. He probably won't get it, but he deserved it.3. Tom Hanks is just a really fine actor. He was driving the whole thing with his convincing performance. I still can't believe he got my tearing in that scene, or let's just say crying. Greengrass has taken him to squeeze some fine acting skills.4. Fair screenplay that didn't make you forget that justice should be done, no matter how the conditions the person lives in, but it also pushed the eyes to take a look into the world that would produce such people as pirates.",positive
War Dogs,"Much like 'American Made' and 'Atomic Blonde,' this also mismatches the cast and turns what should be a drama into an action film with the wrong feel to it. Miles Teller looks like a boy scout.

War Dogs,"if War Dogs could be funny as it's trailer promises, it's rating could be seven...but not even close to two if you actually watch it.War Dogs is a constraining comedy movie with lots of clichés and has only one scene that's half action, half funny on it.the most wtf moment for me all through the movie is, the appearance of Jonah Hill. He looks like an obese, over tanned Bradley Cooper. Some one like, from the future or past of Bradley's character, seriously, when Teller's character meets with Bradley's character at the bar, for the first time, for a second, i waited something like: "" hey! i'm from the future! don't do this."" etc.any way, nothing exciting, funny or compelling here, move along.",positive
Pawn Sacrifice,"The best movies are those where the filmmakers do their research. Director Cronenberg and Christopher Hampton clearly care enough about the psychiatric practice in order to study it carefully and skillfully weave theory into the lives of the characters in the movie, ""A Dangerous Mind."" Darren Aronofsky, likewise, clearly did his research into the inner world of professional wrestling in order to make his film, ""The Wrestler."" As a result, ""The Wrestler"" not only had compelling human stories, but we also got to understand what the lives of some wrestlers were really like with their drug use, the male camaraderie, and the physical stamina involved in one bruising fight after the other.Yet with ""Pawn Sacrifice,"" we get the sense that that Director Edward Zwick, the three screenwriters, and the producers are not really interested in learning anything about chess – despite the fact that this movie was about the only American to become World Chess Champion, Bobby Fischer. Instead, ""Pawn Sacrifice"" is solely a character study on Bobby Fischer (played quite well by Tobey Maguire) with his personality quirks and bad temper, but divorced from his chess. For instance, there are a few scenes where Bobby Fischer defeated Soviet grandmaster Ivanov. Ivanov then withdraws from the tournament by claiming that he came down with influenza. Fair enough, but how was Fischer able to defeat Ivanov? And what made Fischer's chess victory any different from the victories which other grandmasters had over Ivanov? The film does not answer these questions, because it does not even bother to take the time to explain the chess game to us. I also have the same complaint about Fischer's victory over Victor Korchnoi. Korchnoi was a master at defence and counterattack and one of the strongest grandmasters in the world by the late 1960s. So how was Fischer able to beat him? Again, this question goes unanswered, probably because the filmmakers and producers assumed that the game of chess was too boring to be worth explaining to anyone or they were not particularly interested in Fischer's unique genius for chess, which inspired a future generation of Soviet chess players like Garry Kasparov. Yet if they really felt like this, why make a movie about Fischer at all? The reason why neglecting to explain Fischer's chess games is such a big flaw is two-fold. To begin with, Fischer's brand of chess is what made him so unique and extraordinary -- not his moods or his wild conspiracy theories. Yet judging from the film, I do not yet see how Fischer's chess was any different from Soviet grandmaster Ivanov's. Second, Fischer sacrificed everything, including his sanity, to achieve a mastery over his unique craft which no one else had. So shouldn't we get a clear idea of how challenging professional chess is? Should we not be given a clear idea of the hurdles Fischer had to overcome in order to become world champion? And also why achieving this level of mastery over chess was so important that Fischer was willing to sacrifice as much as he did? These are also questions that this film has not addressed.""Pawn Sacrifice"" does have its strengths. All the performances are pretty solid, especially Tobey Maguire's as Bobby Fischer. We get to understand this man's inner demons, his intense sensitivity to noises and lights, his paranoia and anti-Semitism, and his eccentricities. These aspects of Fischer are of some interest to us, since they foreshadow his eventual and tragic psychological breakdown. Yet ""Pawn Sacrifice"" can hardly be considered a great film, largely because the filmmakers seem as clueless about Fischer's chess genius (which I assume is a hugely important component of the film) as the young woman who took away his virginity in California.6.5/10",negative
Pawn Sacrifice,"""Pawn Sacrifice"" (2015 release; 115 min.) is a fictional bio-pick about chess legend Bobby Fischer. As the movie opens, we get archive TV news footage from a bunch of different countries with the shocking news that Bobby Fischer did not show up for Game 2 of the Chess World Championship, as we see Fischer holed up in his room, refusing to come out. We then go back to ""15 November '51, Brooklyn, NY"", where we meet 8 yr. old Bobby, growing up with his mom. We already see his mind getting restless quickly, but also starting to astonish with his chess moves. At this point we're maybe 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: when I herd earlier this year that a movie was being made about the life and times of Bobby Fischer, and that it was directed by none other than Edward Zwick (the director of ""Glory"" and ""Defiance"", among others), I was pretty excited about it. Alas, it was not to be. What I thought would be a bio-pick on Fischer's life, turns out to be a very selective look instead. The movie's focus is clearly, and almost to the exclusion of everything else, on the 1972 World Championship against Boris Spassky. Yes, we do get a few glimpses of the younger Fischer. Fischer's mental problems do not get examined in-depth but are dealt with hastily. ""Bob has problems"" comments Father Lombarty, to which someone responds ""So did Mozart"", and end of story. Most disappointing for me was that the film essentially stops with Fischer's win in 1972. The remaining 36 years of his life, which remain clouded in mystery for a good part, are dismissed in about 2 minutes at the end of the movie. The leading acting performances, with Tobey Maguire as Bobby Fischer and Liev Schreiber as Boris Spassky, are quite good, but keep your eye out as well for up-and-coming Canadian actress Évelyne Brochu in the role of Donna, Fischer's very first girlfriend (when he already was in his 20s). If you are interested in a more in-depth look at the life and times of Bobby Fischer, I'd readily recommend the excellent 2011 documentary ""Bobby Fischer Against The World"".""Pawn Sacrifice"" opened this weekend on five screens for all of Greater Cincinnati. I was eager to see it. The matinée screening where I saw this at today turned out to be a private screening, as in: I literally was the only person in the theater.

Ip Man 4: The Finale,"As a Chinese, this was nothing but embarrassing. It has no plot, no acting skills, and no moral. It portrayed Americans as brainless prejudiced hatred-filled demons.

The Infiltrator,"I am a fan of Cranston which is why I went to see this film. I've felt he chooses projects that are solid pieces of story telling. I immediately felt that had I not read the book many years ago, I would not have known what was happening because the story telling in the movie is very disjointed and somewhat uneven. A huge problem is Cranston's age. He's too old for the role of Mazur. At the time the events took place Mazur would have been about 40, Cranston looks 60. He has young kids, and Diane Kruger is much younger than him. So I didn't buy into the character as being believable as nonfiction.More could have been added to let the audience know what the police department was facing financially to front his undercover operation. That is a key issue to this story. The undercover cost was huge. I was not disappointed that there was not a lot of action, I wanted a film with lots of dialogue but more detailed storytelling so the audience can follow the challenges of the behind- the-scenes undercover operation. I wanted more of the thought process behind Mazur's decision to take on another case instead of retiring when he could. What was his motivation to take on this dangerous assignment? Never saw a dialogue between him and his wife about his motives since this case would take a toll on their family. The film felt like a made for TV on USA Network or the CW, not a Hollywood production. The acting overall is fine, but the dialogue was stiff. Drug world stories can be a yawn but I was expecting it to be much closer to the book which is why the combination of having read the book and liking Cranston so much led me to want to see this film. The movie didn't need more star power than Cranston, Kruger, Dukakis (love all her work) Bratt and Leguizano. Aaron Paul would have made a good Mazur but he's too young - Bob Odenkirk would be the right age and might have been a more interesting choice as Mazur. One detail that was not clear to me was the fate of Pablo Escobar. Cranston would have been better used as a supporting character, someone working with John Leguizamo, and John was great, and he's believable as a drug informant. Kruger was stunning as the fiancé and it's interesting that after this case she never again went undercover. Seems like a smart move since there were some close calls. This won't be the summer hit I thought it would be and it might play well on Netflix or Cinemax. The film looked grainy so that might be challenging for a small screen. Not sure why it was done that way, I found it distracting. Overall not fun movie going experience. If the story of Pablo Escobar is of interest, pick up the book, it's a page turner. The details are worth knowing and one gets the sense of the complications inherent in undercover work and the risks everyone takes. The book also tells of the creative ways drugs are moved from country to country. And more could have been emphasized why following the money, not the drugs, is a better trail to Escobar.",negative
The Infiltrator,"The movie isn't perfect but when it is good it is really good. There are so many interesting aspects about the drug war that haven't been shown so centrally on film before - the white collar financial type undercover DEA operation and the money laundering aspect. This movie is timely and relevant. It's fascinating to see the money laundering by BCCI. And right now the money laundering scandal with the Malaysian fund 1MDB stretching from the U.S. to banks in Singapore is playing out. Drug movies have to be shooting a minute action movies to be exciting.Brian Cranston is as always watchable and sympathetic. It takes a moment of getting used to him on the other side of the drug war and Walter White comes to mind now and then. Diane Kruger shines as a DEA undercover agent posing as his fiancé. She is convincing, watchable and beautiful. She needs more feature film roles.There are a few faults: it's a bit confusing who some of the minor drug characters are and which side they are on. Some things leave you a bit confused and should have been clearer. Please give this movie a chance - don't give up if the start is a bit slow. This is a true story that deserves to be widely known. If you enjoyed Narcos so far this is a real treat.",positive
The Report,"As a historical account, it's lacking and gives a ""I'm above the fray"" angle to Feinstein and the Democrats. The Senate Intelligence Committee knew about the enhanced interrogation, and signed off on it, until the political climate changed. The movie completely whitewashes this fact and pretends Feinstein was just this innocent who *shockingly* finds out later. She was part of the SIC, after all.Jose Rodriguez (CIA Chief) briefed Pelosi and the Senate Intelligence committee in *2002*, and they were cool with what the CIA was doing. Rodriguez gives specifics as to who was there and when this occurred.Whether you believe the CIA was right or wrong in what they did, to pretend the Democrats were innocent in this is complete BS, and is revisionist history.I think these facts have to be taken into account in the rating of a movie like this. Either it's accurate, or it's not. After all, part of the movie is in the writing, and if the writing isn't accurate in a ""true story"", then it's not a true story.As far as the movie itself, it has decent pacing, and the actors portraying the politicians are very good, however you end up leaving a bit unsatisfied. The so called whistleblower is completely glossed over and details are completely lacking, and I think it's pretty obvious as to why that is.",negative

The Man Who Invented Christmas,This film will delight you. See it with family and friends. Without a second thought. Nothing is wrong about it.,negative
The Man Who Invented Christmas,"When Dan Stevens asked that Matthew, his ""Downton Abbey"" character, be ""killed off"" so he could pursue other acting opportunities, I thought his career would go directly downhill. Matthew Crawley was a pleasant young man - but really didn't give Stevens much meat to chew so I figured his career would go the unsuccessful way of many other actors of limited talent who left successful TV parts. However, he was right to leave. He is much more talented than Matthew Crawley allowed him to be. His versatility is showcased to perfection as Charles Dickens in THE MAN WHO INVENTED Christmas.It doesn't hurt that his Dickens is surrounded by a charming group of eccentrics, some of whom exist in his 19th century reality and others of whom exist only in his fertile imagination. I particularly liked Anna Murphy's Tara, the Irish housemaid who presents Dickens with inspiration for several key elements in his ""A Christmas Carol."" Ms. Murphy's career should advance as she has a quite likable screen persona and an ability to stand out in any scene.Christopher Plummer is wonderful in every part in which he plays. What woman wouldn't want to heal the heart of his Captain Von Trappe (THE SOUND OF MUSIC)? Who wouldn't want to hear his Chang declaim Shakespeare in its original Klingon(STAR TREK VI)? And who couldn't be caught up in the soul of Hal in his Academy Award winning BEGINNERS? I saw him in his stage presentation of BARRYMORE and was mesmerized. His Scrooge is equally mesmerizing.The script is tight, the acting is solid, the sets, costumes, and staging are perfectly 1843. This movie should become a true Christmas classic - just as ""A Christmas Carol"" itself is a classic. In short - I loved it!",positive
The Danish Girl,"First the good: Alicia Vikander gives an excellent performance in a poorly written role. The music, when it's not loudly substituting for a decent script, is often lovely. And the historical context is illuminating, especially the very real danger of institutionalization. Other than that, what a mass of prestige picture clichés, laughably symmetrical camera set-ups and gorgeous landscape cinematography. And poor Eddie Redmayne. Completely out of his depth in the central role. Obviously, no one knows how well Lili Elbe passed for a woman, but no one, and I mean absolutely no one, would mistake Redmayne's Lili for anything else but an awkward, clumsy male in a bad wig. Granted, that would make an interesting take on this story: someone who believes they look like a woman but who doesn't. But that's not what this film proposes. Quite the opposite, which is why the audience consistently laughed every time the film suggested that Elbe herself, or other characters believed in the success of the transformation. The script is so cliché ridden and repetitious that even an actor as fine as Matthias Schoenaerts can't liven it up. And for some reason he is made up to look like a sweaty cadaver. And again,I felt bad for Mr. Redmayne, that he didn't get the directorial help he needed in the role and a better script that left him more to say than the trite and predictable lines in this one.",negative
The Danish Girl,"I honestly found this movie very touching and delicate. It is delicate in the way it treats difficult subjects as sexuality and the discovery of one's identity in an hostile period. The fact that it is a true story makes the whole movie even more involving.I don't think the film is perfect - but the acting, cinematography, the screenplay are absolutely amazing. I especially loved the middle part - where all the characters try to find a way out of the problem and when for the first time they seem to be facing a fracture between them.I thought it had a great power on people even though it doesn't seem to have had the effect I was expecting (at least during the premiere in Venice).Eddie Redmayne hasn't had enough of his Oscar and I wish him all the best for 2016!",positive
Steve Jobs,"After watching this era's angry, visionary, entrepreneur's business meetings in the movie called -part one of the saga - Jobs at 2013, this year we are facing the second part of the saga: Steve Jobs. As we all saw how business meetings were bloody, this time we'll visit the product launch and marketing meetings section of, angry Steve.Like part one, part two is crafted with dialogue. Non-stop conflicts of angry Steve and world. Expect nothing more than talking people. Mission for the crowd is to understand how brilliant angry Steve and how he shaped the things by listening the conversations and carefully tracing body language.Next episode, we'll dwell into monolouges of angry Steve while he's unloading his sh*t. Long mind conversations happens inside of this brilliant mind, while peeling a health apple. Waste of time, tells nothing to the audience. How come somebody watchs -at least- Jobs and had motivation to do another, just conversation based movie about this man. Pirates of the Silicon Valley is still best film about this specific topic, there are no competitors to it. one last word, I could understand what's so weird or unacceptable about behaviours of a man, who creates his own company from nothing to a biggest company in the world. I mean, i know much terrible dudes, who owns literally nothing but treats his employee like they are waste of sperm because somebody told him that he's the Ceo of a company. Business in human world runs like this. You have to slap everybody in the face if you want what you want.very terrible movie. shame on you Mr. Boyle and if your movies will be like this, please spare Trainspotting 2 from happening.",negative
Steve Jobs,"Steve Jobs is written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by Danny Boyle. It stars Micheal Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, Jeff Daniels, and Michael Stuhlbarg.Set backstage at three iconic product launches and ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac, Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution to paint a portrait of the man, his estranged family and staff at its epicenter.I honestly can't start this review without saying this easily ties with my favorite movie of the year, The Gift, for quite a few reasons. Truth be told this movie has everything needed to build a classic and uses it remarkably.Writer Aaron Sorkin has quite a few gems in his filmography which include Money Ball, Social Network and A Few Good Men. He is as versatile as he is brutal in honesty. He works wonders in this movie revealing the man behind the machine rather than the machine behind the man. Without any scenes of failure or success, Sorkin forces his audience to understand the complex and often times revolting central Character. With extremely well written confrontations between Jobs and Wozniak or Jobs and his Daughter or even Jobs and his Boss, Sorkin relentlessly demonstrates the true nature behind the tech giant. Though this movie's central family tension and the Job vs. Apple drama are enthralling, Sorkin injects just enough dry and black comedy to keep the movie from becoming an influential figure's shaming. With that being said Sorkin also understands that the enormous ego of Steve Jobs had to be exposed as a vice and plays on that brutal fact perfectly. With 4 dimensional characters, great central dramas and pitch perfect comedy, this might actually be his best work yet.Accompanying the stellar writing was Danny Boyle's beautiful direction. Through seemingly unending shots and aggressive movements the audience genuinely feels like their in Job's presence which can be very hard to sit through at times but is ultimately rewarding experience. With visible passion from Boyle, this is one powerful ride.To my common readers I mentioned a few weeks back that Black Mass had the greatest ensemble cast of the year, I was wrong. This movies cast never really stops acting to the point of absolute realism. To start Kate Winslet portrayal of real life Johanna Hoffman was as beautiful as it was naive. She brought the character alive in full force and truly demonstrated she is one of the best actresses working. I smell a nomination coming her way. I had referenced Jeff Daniel's acting last week in The Martian, well he completely out did himself. He was tender at times and shark-like in others. He drew the line between intelligence and decency and walks this tight rope carefully. Five year old Mekenzie Moss also offers an absolutely astounding performance, uttering few but heart wrenching words. Michael Stuhlbarg works wonder as well on a albeit smaller degree. Now onto the two heavy hitters. A surprise to me and my theater alike, Seth Rogan gives the single best dramatic performance of his career. As Steve Wozniak, the literal opposite of Jobs, Rogan played the role with elegance and brilliance and I wouldn't even mind the Benicio snub if Rogen won the statue. The role demanded a sweet, naive, caring and ultimately explosive performance and Rogan more than delivered making the scenes of abrasion between him and Fassbender iconic. I have been holding off that name for the entire review because Micheal Fassbender is the only thing keeping this movie from failing. He dawns the character in such a way, I can only compare it to Jake Gyllenhaal from Night Crawler and even then I don't think I could fully describe it. Filled to the brim with nuance Fassbender offers a cold, intelligent, manipulative, calculating, and over all disturbingly realistic portrayal of Steve Jobs. I really can't envision a better cast lead than him. As calm as he is diabolical, Fassbender plays this egotistical narcissist with such precision its close to horrifying to watch. Though calm through most of the movie Fassbender understands when to unleash the monster which lays in Jobs and is absolutely volcanic while doing so. Under all the deception, tyranny, and technological brilliance lays a purely adroit and masterful performance. Though Johnny Depp in Black Mass was great and Ian McClellan in Mr. Holmes was grand, neither of them embodied their characters much like Micheal Fassbender and it would be a shame and a disservice to cinema if he didn't with Best Actor. He has proved he is one of the best actors of the generation.Steve Jobs was a privilege to see on the big screen and is so far tied with The Gift as my number one movie of the year. With Deft acting, exquisite direction, and powerful writing this movie is not far from a modern classic. Steve Jobs gets an A+.",positive
Saving Mr. Banks,"I was able to view an advanced screening of Saving Mr. Banks. I will have to rate it as an excellent movie. It made me laugh, it made me cry and it certainly brought back memories. I enjoyed it very much. The film was on the most part incredibly true to era. I felt the transitioning from one time period to the other was done smoothly and poignantly. Obtaining the screen rights for the making of Mary Poppins and the childhood of P.T. Travers are intricately woven. The entire point of the movie could not have been made without this aspect. It was brilliantly done. I see many Oscar nominations here. Tom Hanks was outstanding as always as well as Emma Thompson. Colin Farrell was remarkable. The interactions of all the characters was beyond well done.",negative
Saving Mr. Banks,"From the studio that brought you Mary Poppins, Disney has released a biopic about the author of the original novels, P.L Travers. Saving Mr. Banks is the story of her battles with Walt Disney, who wants the rights to the film adaptation, in a dramatic comedy that is both witty and sentimental.Mrs. Pamela P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) has been hounded by Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) and the Disney Corporation for 20 years for the film rights to her book and she has refused constantly. But by 1961, she has run out of money and agrees to go to Los Angeles for two weeks to work with the writing team to see if a deal can be struck. Her conditions are that the film cannot be animated, there are no songs and she has final script approval. Travers quickly clashes with creative team and Walt himself, a man who promised his daughters he would adapt the book.As this is going on Travers reflects on her childhood in rural Australia, with her father (Colin Farrell), a loving man who feeds his daughter's imagination, but an alcoholic with probable depression and how these events influenced her writing.Saving Mr. Banks is a film armed with excellent screenplay and a top notch cast. As well as the likes of Thompson, Hanks and Farrell, Saving Mr. Banks also features Bradley Whittaker, Jason Schwartzman, Paul Giamatti, B.J. Novak and Ruth Wilson. They all offer strong performances and have given us very well defined characters. Thompson dominates as Travers, a no nonsense woman with poor social skills and a British Bulldog stubbornness/determination and injects a deadpan humour with the witty lines she was given. Thompson also brings out the emotion, the serious aspects of the character, as the shadows of her past still linger over her.One of the big themes of the film is the writing process, both the individual, personal aspect and the collaborative effect of a film adaptation. Saving Mr. Banks shows that many writers use they personal experience and life and become a part of the author. It is hard for writers to let go and particularly for Travers, as she has so much invested in Mary Poppins, so much of herself in it. Her books allowed her to have some wish fulfilment.The screenwriters Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith, director John Lee Hancock and editor Mark Livoisi worked brilliant to blending the story of Travers butting heads with Disney's creative team and her backstory about her childhood influencing her writing. There are plenty of transitions, allowing Hancock to have some fancy pans. One particular noticeable sequence is when the creative team performs one of the songs and Travers has a flashback. The film slowly reveals how Travers childhood and her father became a part of her writing, used in the books and become a part of the themes of her books and philosophies. This is particularly the case with her parents and their inabilities to cope, both Travers' father's alcoholism and mother's inability to cope with the stress, leading to her theme of responsibility. For a film that is about the writing process, Saving Mr. Banks never really shows about the writing process that Travers goes through, but explores the writing process of adapting a work, from one medium to another.The final theme and a big part of the comedy comes from the clashes of cultures and personalities. Travers is a brash personality with formal, conservative approach and lives a modest lifestyle in London and a rustic life in Australia. This in comparison to the overtly friendly American and their glamour and excess, from the fashion to the food, particularly sweet treats and the hard sell from Disney in Travers' hotel room.Saving Mr. Banks has a excellent screenplay, solid direction and balances the comedy dramatic portions extremely well. The film makes sure there is plenty of sentiment, particularly with the score by Thomas Newman. It is a safe film, but still a pleasing experience. It is perfect if you are a fan of Mary Poppins and you will have the songs stuck in your head.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",positive
Black Mass,"""Out of the Furnace"" director Scott Cooper's ""Black Mass"" qualifies as a gritty, atmospheric, but middling mobster melodrama that chronicles the life and crimes of James ""Whitey"" Bulger, a notorious Boston gangster with an Irish upbringing who evaded authorities for 16 years before justice eventually caught and convicted him for 11 homicides. Adapted from a thoroughgoing non-fiction bestseller by ""Boston Globe"" reporters Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, this unsavory, R-rated, crime chiller provides ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star Johnny Depp with a chance to atone for far too many silly, superficial comedies. Academy Award-winner Jack Nicholson did an imaginary take on this real-life sociopath in Martin Scorsese's memorable law and order epic ""The Departed,"" a mob movie ten times more suspenseful than ""Black Mass."" Now, Depp stars as the infamous felon himself. Although he appears incredibly chilling as the bloodthirsty maniac who is currently serving two life sentences plus five years, nothing about Depp's performance reveals any insights about this heinous individual. Indeed, thanks to prosthetics galore, Depp bears a striking resemblance to Bulger, but nothing beneath his grim, tight-lipped portrayal yields a clue about the murderer's mindset. Reportedly, Bulger refused to talk to Depp about his life. Meantime, this is not the Depp that we have grown accustomed to in movies like the frivolous ""Pirates"" franchise, ""The Lone Ranger,"" ""Tusk,"" ""Dark Shadows,"" and ""Mortdecai."" Instead, this is the Depp of ""Public Enemies,"" ""Donnie Brasco,"" and ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico."" As Bulger, Depp strangles a defenseless young harlot with a rope, beats an adversary to death with his bare fists, and mows downs an unarmed, but treacherous henchman with a carbine. Don't walk into ""Black Mass"" and imagine you're going to see something that will make you giggle with glee. Unquestionably, ""Black Mass"" constitutes a long overdue return to form for the immensely talented Depp. Critics have hailed his performance as Oscar worthy. As unforgettable as Depp is, the man who steals the show and delivers the best performance is Depp's co-star Joel Edgerton of ""Warriors."" Cast as corrupt FBI Agent John Connolly, who conspired with the real-life Bulger to shield him from prosecution, Edgerton emerges as nothing short of sensational. While Depp relies on prosthetics to impersonate Bulger, Edgerton shuns elaborate make-up and turns the tainted FBI agent into a sympathetic flesh and blood character. He gets under Connolly's skin and shows us what makes the man tick.A profane, violent, but episodic crime thriller, ""Black Mass"" covers familiar ground. Director Scott Cooper, who also helmed ""Crazy Heart,"" neither pulls any punches in his casual depiction of mob violence nor does he startle us with any surprises. You've seen everything that Cooper stages here in other gangster movies. Essentially, ""Black Mass"" is an empire-building crime film, but Cooper doesn't recount either how Bulger established his empire or solidified it with his intimidating reputation. Instead, he dwells on episodes that earlier movies like ""The Departed,"" ""Goodfellas,"" ""The Town,"" ""Killing Me Softly,"" ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle,"" and the two ""Boondock Saints"" thrillers have done before and done with greater panache. Basically, the action unfolds in five year increments, beginning in 1975 as a number of Bulger's cronies cut deals with the Feds to save their necks. Freshman scenarist Mark Mallouk and ""Edge of Tomorrow"" scribe Jez Butterworth neglect to explore the psychology behind the treachery that prompted Bulger's underlings to inform on him. Meantime, Cooper focuses almost entirely on the relationship between Bulger and Connolly. The subplot involving Whitey's older brother Billy could have been left on the editing room floor. Incredibly, ""Black Mass"" omits some of the more compelling incidents in the page-turning Lehr and O'Neill book. Specifically, the filmmakers have altered the events that brought Bulger and Connolly together as conspirators as well as some of the crimes. A convicted bank robber who did 9-years in Alcatraz, Bulger masqueraded as a Robin Hood-style gangster around South Boston, but his fellow goons weren't fooled by his shenanigans. Ironically, loyalty among these thieves is the first casualty. As the film unfolds, Bulger henchman Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons of ""Varsity Blues""), goes on the record swearing that he isn't a ""rat!"" On the other hand, FBI Agent John Connolly worshiped the ground that Bulger trod and refused to testify against him. Connolly grew up in the same blue-collar Irish neighborhood as Bulger. Whitey intervened in a fight where Connolly would have suffered grievously without his support. Connolly struggles to convince his wife Marianne (Julianne Nicholson of ""Kinsey"") that loyalty supersedes morality. Nevertheless, her husband's adulation for Bulger repels her. Connolly sets out to recruit Bulger as a source, but Bulger balks at being an informant. Inevitably, Connolly forges an unholy alliance with Bulger, so the Bureau can crush the Mafia in Boston and he could claim credit for the demise of the Italians. Ultimately, Connolly sold his soul to the devil, while Cooper makes Bulger appear as sinister as Satan.Distinguished by its brooding cinematography, authentic production values, and documentary flavor, ""Black Mass"" succeeds more as a tour de force showcase for the actors than a landmark example of a gangster movie. A top-tier supporting cast, featuring ""Sherlock"" star Benedict Cumberbatch as Bulger's brother Billy, who carved out a reputation for himself in Congress as a man of the people, surround Depp and Edgerton. Kevin Bacon, David Harbour, and Adam Scott play Connolly's eloquent, well-tailored, FBI colleagues. Harbour delivers a powerful performance as the weak link in the group of FBI agents who turn a blind eye to Bulger's criminal activities as long as he furnishes them with information about the Mafia. As Bulger's amoral associates, Rory Cochrane, Jesse Plemons, and W. Earl Brown will make your skin crawl. Peter Sarsgaard rounds out the cast as one of Bulger's sadistic but ill-fated adversaries. Nobody gives a weak performance in ""Black Mass."" Sadly, for all of his crime-does-not-pay sentiments, Cooper has fashioned a dreary, sluggish crime saga devoid of any cinematic flair or unpredictable spontaneity.",negative
Black Mass,"The intrigue of all crime movies relies on a simple idea: people are complex, but actions are not. Behind every reductive, one-word crime —""murder,"" ""theft,"" ""extortion""– is a human with a motive and a history to support that motive. Part of the reason we follow the stories of criminals is to overlay ourselves on their paths, trace the steps around their intentions, and see where they turn where you would not. Great crime stories give us the opportunity feel our own humanity guide us through darkness. Unfortunately, I felt nothing while watching Black Mass.Heralded as a return to acting form for Johnny Depp, Black Mass tells the true-crime story of James ""Whitey"" Bulger, a mythologized, south-Boston crime lord who operated from the late 70's to early 90's. As an adaptation of the best-selling book of the same name by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, the film portrays the key years of Bulger's ascent to power in the Boston crime world, during which he acted as an FBI-informant through slick FBI agent (and Southie homeboy) John Connolly (Joel Edgerton). At the behest of Connolly and his less enthusiastic boss Charles McGuire (Kevin Bacon), Bulger provides information that precipitates the downfall of the Italian mob, allowing his own Winter Hill gang to take over all aspects of Boston crime, from the drug trade to money laundering, and everything in-between.However, with such a compelling, cant-fail crime premise, the film is bafflingly hollow. Other than hearing a laundry list of crimes that Bulger supposedly spearheads, we almost never see any crimes being committed, other than the odd shotgun rampage or prostitute murder (both which felt sadly derivative for such gruesome scenes). Doors slam, money is exchanged, and men with furrowed brows walk hastily down empty alleys—but it never feels like we are made to understand why.Where is the money coming from? What are Whitey's motivations? Who are the victims of these crimes, or rather, where are the commoners (for a film with such a large cast, it seems completely devoid of extras) of Boston at all? Even the undeniable Benedict Cumberbatch seems adrift and misused in his role as Whitey's state senator brother Billy Bulger.Director Scott Cooper chose to focus only on a handful of key years during Whitey's reign of terror, perhaps to draw focus on his peak instead of wasting time on his rise or fall. Unfortunately, the result is a dubiously avowed criminal juggernaut who feels–and sometimes looks—like he is made out of paper. Much has been made of Depp's transformation into the balding, ghostly Bulger through the magic of makeup, prosthetics, and false teeth. He looks legitimately ghoulish throughout the film, yet the performance feels thin and insubstantial, perhaps less due to Depp's acting than to the camera's disinterest.Depp does has his moments, especially in one particularly tense scene where he slinks out of the shadows to confront Connolly's untrusting wife Marianne (Julianne Nicholson), lurking over her like a pale, demonic shadow. During that scene, I felt like I was watching a horror movie. Afterwards, I could only lament the fact the rest of the movie didn't try harder to be a horror movie, or didn't try harder to be anything interesting at all.Black Mass has the trappings of a great film with solid performances, beautifully lit shots, and a wealth of source materials, making its ultimate failure that much more disappointing. Crime stories are a staple of American cinema and we accept them for their inherent limitations. However, in 2015 it's simply unacceptable to approach the making of a crime movie with absolutely no creative spirit.Several other reviews have likened Black Mass to a poor imitation of Goodfellas or other Scorsese films. If Goodfellas is the gourmet pâtisserie of crime movies, then Black Mass is an airport Cinnabon, a fluorescently lit sprawl of half baked, cookie-cutter crime characters we've all come to expect–a dash of angry FBI chief here, a sprinkle of disgruntled mob grunt there–who delivered their lines and then seemingly evaporate into stale air. The movie runs over two excruciating hours yet fails to make plain the impact of the Bulger's crimes, resulting in a story which accomplishes the impossible feat of feeling both protracted and unfinished.Scott Cooper strives to portray Whitey Bulger as the boogeyman, an unstoppable nightmare whose actions are made infinitely more terrifying by the knowledge that they exist in reality. Instead, Black Mass is the kind of dream that you forget the instant you wake up.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",positive
American Made,"Fun movie, if not for the fact that the truth was changed to protect the guilty. In real life, Barry Seal was fired from TWA in '72 when he was charged for smuggling plastic explosives across Mexico. He flew tons of coke into the States for multiple drug kingpins, including Escobar. When he was busted, he started working for the DEA as an informant. He was overweight, poisoned his fellow Americans with drugs; and didn't care about his family enough to enter WITSEC.From a historical perspective, it should be taken with a grain of salt that a guy like Seal, given his position, can be placed in a situation where everything is cool, time after time after time after time again.",negative
American Made,"By Terry Reed, Author of Compromised: Clinton, Bush and the CIA. It finally happened. The complex core of my book Compromised, the CIA's covert guns and drugs debacle cleverly mislabeled the Iran Contra Scandal, has hit the big screen thanks to the efforts of Universal Studios, Director Doug Liman, Screen Writer Gary Spinelli, Tom Cruise and a host of professionals. Liman told me he was attracted to this project as a result of insider information he gleaned from his father Arthur Liman, Chief Counsel for the US Senate's investigation of the Iran Contra affair.As the person who wrote the original, first hand and definitive book on the Barry Seal/Mena, Arkansas operation, from the inside, I was the most skeptical critic the movie had to win over since I had lived much of the Mena ordeal right along side Barry Sealthe movie's main character played by Cruise.Sure, there are major deviations from the historical record of what happened in Mena, and the screenwriter exercised his dramatic license combining characters and blending together events for the purpose of cramming this sordid story into 120 minutes of educational entertainment. But that's Hollywood.As someone who worked with several major Hollywood production companies and screen writers (Clint Eastwood and Dennis Hackin just to drop names) who attempted to bring Compromised to the theaters, I realize how difficult it is find that balance between authenticity, entertainment, time constraints and marketability. Doug Liman has done just that! Those I worked with who attempted to whittle Compromised down to an understandable narrative were most often left with a docudrama type product that in most cases over-reflected the political bend of the whittlers. Just as the title of my book suggests, the Iran Contra scandal and the subsequent unraveling of a CIA covert operation run amuck impacts both political parties. Sure, most will argue that Hollywood is liberal and most likely to err on the side of protect-the-Democrats at all costs, but let's face it, the vast majority of the guns and drugs scandal imbedded within the Mena/Contra support program falls directly into Republican laps. Again, Liman did a superb job of staying true to the Mena geographical location and then suggesting strongly that then-Governor Bill Clinton had a hand in it when the US Attorney's efforts to apprehend Seal in Arkansas are thwarted.But alas, two hours is a short time to compress history, relay intricate information into a comprehensible story line and then ultimately deal with the life and fate of Cruise's character, pilot Barry Seal. Cruise for the most part is receiving accolades for his Seal portrayal, and I agree American Made underscores that occasionally Cruise can move outside of his Mission Impossible persona and reacquaint us with the depths of his talent.I must say how rewarding it is to have consulted on the movie with Doug Liman and his staff, and to see how he wove the nuances I provided into the scenes in such an authentic and unobtrusive way. The Contra training camp and mile-high-club scene are just a few of those nuggets that cause the screenplay to frequently place foot on terra firma.Debbie Seal, the real life widow of Barry who unfortunately is being forced to relive this tragic chapter of her life by watching her husband's demise, saw the movie in a different light. She reminded me that Barry was double-crossed by the Reagan White House which not only resulted in her husband's death by Pablo Escobar, but also forced her to raise their three children alone. Debbie compared it to Jacqueline Kennedy watching a movie of the JFK assassination. A grim reality check.The Mena/Iran Contra scandal resulted in many of us falling into the category of ""disposable assets"" and being falsely labeled when a covert White House back door operation ran amuck, and we became political liabilities. Much of what we suffered through was the result of cowardly behavior on behalf of the Reagan/Bush Administrations who knew full well that many of us who were recruited for this covert operation were ""left in the cold"" and disavowed when this violation of Congressional Law (The Boland Amendment) became public knowledge. Most of us were Vietnam Veterans who had skill sets needed for the operation and felt honored to be selected to become part of a CIA backed Air America style operation.This is where I do take exception to the movie plot line. Many of us, myself included, had nothing to do with the transportation of illegal narcotics into America. We were briefed on Barry Seal's multi-prong, multi-agency (DEA, and US Customs undercover activities penetrating the Medellin Cartel that included ""controlled deliveries"" of cocaine) operation but the vast majority of us were tasked with the difficult and dangerous work of training the Contras to build out their own guerilla warfare weapons air delivery system and delivering both munitions and humanitarian aid in a war zone. The movie had two different opportunities to move deeper in this direction, but I presume time constraints kept the plot line humming along in the direction it took.All in all it is a great first effort to bring the Iran Contra scandal to the movie theaters. It is about flawed human nature, war, life, death and the seedy behavior of politicians and the alphabet soup federal agencies that violate their own codes of ethics and policies,all in the guise of National Security.If you haven't seen American Made do so. But I must brief you. Fasten your seat belt, stow your tray table and get ready for an exciting, educational and turbulent flight.P.S. Thank you Doug Liman for your satchel charge effort to blow the doors off this scandal. Iran Contra still screams out for an in-depth and tell-all docudrama production that lets the political fall-out descend as it may and truly takes no prisoners. I am currently working on that project.",positive
In the Heart of the Sea,"Heart of the Sea is a mass-produced still-life painting: technically proficient but as flat as the canvas it's on. Technically, it's fine; the cinematography is interesting, the actors hit their marks, the sound is on point. But other than a few moments of nice humor and mild sea-faring thrills, the film lacks any spark. It's like director Howard and co. weren't that interested in creating an emotional, cerebral or exciting film, but more focused on simply getting the job done. The story of 19th century whaler Owen Chase (played by an oddly-accented Hemsworth), the influence for the literary classic Moby Dick, is a story worth knowing. However, the giant scale and obsession inherent in this tale is never fully conveyed, as Howard opts for computers and green screens, in lieu of the actual sea, to tell his story. So instead of a propulsive thriller or even a thoughtful psychological study, we get a generic and forgettable action/adventure, couched in boring characters. And much like the crew of the Essex itself, we are stranded in a seemingly endless sea of lackluster storytelling It also features some of the worst cinematic framing ever. Instead of just filming Moby Dick itself or just the story of real-life Owen Chase, they opt for a messy mash-up, constantly cutting away from the Essex's voyage to a recounting of the story to Melville; like bad narration taken to the nth degree. Even some marginally compelling moments showing the survival instincts of desperate people can't save this sinking ship. Watch Jaws, All is Lost, or Master and Commander if you want to take a worthwhile trip to the heart of the sea.",negative
In the Heart of the Sea,"This movie definitely makes it on my top 10 list. I originally watched this movie because some of my favorite actors (Chris Hemsworth and Tom Holland, I know I'm a basic white girl) were in the movie. I can now easily say that even though they are great as Spider-Man and Thor, this is my favorite work of both actors. They retold a story of these brave sailors in a new and innovative way. The acting is impeccable and when watching interviews with the actors you can see how much dedication was put into making this movie. Having to starve yourself to do justice to a character isn't easy work. I would 100% recommend to anyone who loves a action/adventure movie!",positive
Loving,"honestly, i didn't find the film interesting at all. for me, i couldn't define the success or struggle story of the Loving couple, all i found was a couple who exposed to oppression, felt injustice, released their anger deeply inward themselves, took silent actions by accepting expatriation for 10 years or more, lived calm and quiet not to be arrested. until the 2 lawyers took the lead of the case.i didn't have any good emotions, sensations towards the movie.it was too long and the important scenes can summarized in 2 or 3 minutes and the rest of the movie was meaningless filler.i don't know if the real story is boring as the film scenario or it really worth to be filmed but in a better way.",negative
Loving,"I had the chance to see this film at the Austin Film Festival, followed by a QA with the writer/director Jeff Nichols. Having already been familiar with this story from the made for television movie in 1996 starring Timothy Hutton and Lela Rochon as Richard and Mildred Loving. Many would ask why now or why remake this film? Well many people are simply unaware of this couple's story and their groundbreaking supreme court case, because it's certainly not mentioned or taught in public schools. So was the case for the writer/director, as mentioned he was not aware of their story. He carefully followed the documentary and archived records about them, while imagining what their conversations and dialogue would have been like between them. I found the landscape of the cinematography beautiful and breathtaking. The acting chemistry between Ruth Negga and Joel Edgarton was so tender and sincere, as you witness their love and vulnerabilities on screen, it makes you love the Lovings. Ruth Negga really shines as the quiet young woman who becomes the matriarch and leader of her family after watching the march on Washington DC, she decides to write a letter to then Attorney General Robert Kennedy. You see the transformation of two introverted people during the civil rights era become activists for change in their own way that is very powerful in this film. Historically many of the biracial descendants of this country's slave owning founding fathers never benefited from the wealth and privilege of the white ancestors. That is part of what what made their case was so monumental, in that it reversed segregationist slave laws that considered biracial children mongrel bastards and prohibited the rights of marriage and inheritance of interracial couples.",positive
All the Money in the World,"This film commits the worst sin a film can commit: It is dreadfully boring. It feels ultimately pointless and dwindles on mediocrity at all times, making this an even worse Ridley Scott film than Alien: Covenant, as that film was at least hilariously bad at times. This one nearly put me and my buddy to sleep.At 2 hours and 12 minutes, this film spends much time meandering and padding out its running time with repetitive low-energy diversions and failure is too often consequence-free. The protagonists feel ineffectual and the baddies feel incompetent and nonthreatening as a result, and the vast majority of the film is people talking back and forth with awkward lengthy pauses in their dialogue. This story isn't all that interesting enough to justify the length, and feels like a formality of Ridley Scott at this point. If you give me a taste of suspense and then show me that this happened over the course of months I will believe you. You don't have to present it in real time.The film's portrayal of the Getty family ""as only obsessed with wealth,"" as Ariadne Getty put it upon seeing the film, is not necessarily based on fact. Sure, J. Paul Getty does state his love for his bloodline throughout the film, but it is heavily weighed against with his cold attitude to the situation and an incredibly cheesy ""gotcha"" moment where Getty appears to be negotiating the ransom only for it to be revealed he was simply negotiating the price on a piece of artwork. It's as basic as these ironic Hollywood anti-Capitalism stories go, where the lack of humanity is cartoonishly exaggerated. I probably would have come up with something like this back when I was an angsty teenager who knew everything about the world.J.'s portrayal isn't the only problem though. Practically every character comes off as shallow and one-dimensional, especially the kidnapping victim, John Paul Getty III, who as a teenager is immediately portrayed as a needlessly ungrateful git towards his mother, and thus I didn't feel attached to him as a character, which is a shame since it's based on a real person. Fletcher Chase comes off as terribly incompetent right out of the gate as the movie doesn't spend much of its excessive time portraying his detective work on screen and simply shows one brief interaction which leads him confidently to a wrong conclusion based on no solid evidence.I wanted more humanity and more depth to the characters. There were interesting ideas brought up, such as the issue of paying a ransom encouraging further kidnappings, which is unfortunately just a one-time throwaway line despite being a rational concern.If you are curious about this event, do yourself a favor and read up on it instead of watching this drawn out lazy Oscar bait. Ridley Scott is so hit-or-miss nowadays that I wonder if even the original Alien film was only accidentally a masterpiece, much like M. Night Shyamalan with The Sixth Sense, Joel Schumacher with Falling Down and Neill Blomkamp with District 9.",negative
All the Money in the World,"How does Plummer do it? Shows up on a day or two notice, then proceeds to steal the film from underneath everyone!
He is incredible, those Golden Globe & Oscar noms were deserved. 
Scott is an expert director, and knows how to pace, stage and film each and every scene perfectly.
Wahberg hasn't been as good as this since 'The Departed', and Michelle Williams is a revelation. Goodbye Streep, I'll take Michelle anyday!
This plays as a gritty thriller, tempered with some humour, within a great script that maintains your interest and no fat left to trim!

Adrift,"I hate it when I see people rating this movie 10/10 because the story was very inspiring. That's not all a movie is about, so I'm quite disappointed at the end ignorance of some.The acting was good, but I feel like the plot was kind of boring. It wasn't intriguing at all. I do agree that the story was very inspiring, but the plot just wasn't and had I known the story before walking into the theatre, I'd have definitely expected an average plot. Directing definitely wasn't bad, but I'm afraid I don't have a lot of good things to say about it. The plot was boring, the directing and the acting was average. Don't expect too much from it.",negative
Adrift,"Well, maybe I lack sophistication, but I thought it was a beautiful story and movie. The way it was interwoven with flashbacks and the present and engineered with dramatic and unforeseen elements really made it quite compelling. It demonstrated the depths of love in a very effective way that stayed with me long after it was over.",positive
The Professor and the Madman,"It seems to me that there is some critique-conspiracy going on around this movie. I just found out there were some legal issues surrounding this movie,but I still don't get all those bad reviews about the movie itself. Normally,I wouldn't even look those up,but they are just popping up whenever I want to google something about the plot or the true story behind it. Anyways,the movie was really enjoyable. The acting was great in my opinion,the story was interesting and captivating. It was shot beautifully. It is not perfect tho,not all parts could hold my attention,but it's a film I would recommend to my friends.",negative
The Professor and the Madman,"First of all, I didn't ever think Sean Penn could out perform his role in Mystic River for which he won the oscar for and is one of my favorite movies. But he took his role in this film to a different level and couldn't have been done any better by anyone else. Mel Gibson's role was just as powerful and I don't think anyone could have done it better than him and goes to prove that Mel can still play a leading role and still be considered at the top of the list to make a memorable movie. Sean Penn will definitely be a contender to win another oscar and in my opinion, he should win it again because I highly doubt he'll be surpassed this year by another actor. This year's oscar belongs to him hands down. The Professor and the Madman is a remarkable story of history that deserves to be told and rewarded.",positive
Dolemite Is My Name,Dolemite is hilarious and one of the funniest comedies I've seen in ages. His raps will make you laugh and it's an entertaining film to enjoy. Eddie Murphy was great and he did a good job playing Dolemite. Good supporting cast too.,negative
Dolemite Is My Name,"""Dolemite is my name"" is one of my favourite movies of the year so far along with Joker and Parasite. It's largely down to the career best performance by Eddie Murphy, who is simply mesmerising as Rudy Ray Moore. He brings so much energy to this role, along with his charm and humour. Eddie has never been this funny. Most of the jokes are raunchy so it might not be for everyone but it's impossible not to fall in love with Eddie in this film. I hope he is nominated in the best actor category at Oscars. He could even win it because he is that good.Apart from Eddie, the film is full of brilliant performances, in particularly by Wesley Snipes who matches and sometimes steals the show from Eddie. It's a true ensemble. It's a shame that this movie is not getting a wide theatrical release because let me tell you if there is one film this year which needed to be seen on the big screen it's 'Dolemite Is My Name"". A hilarious, heartfelt film which gives a really positive message to everyone who has a dream. A must-see crowd pleaser.",positive
Harriet,"Look, nobody's questioning Harriet Tubman's contributions or her role in the history of the abolitionist movement. But, except for the names, this movie has about as much to do with actual history as Underdog does with rescuing war dogs. I have to wonder what would have happened to a black woman walking around in the slave holding south dressed like Hollywood's version of a pseudo Annie Oakley. The filmmakers had a golden opportunity here to get this right but chose to throw a bunch of candified, Hollywood cliches at it instead. That's not to say there weren't some emotional moments, but the real history and achievement of Harriet Tubman is emotional and soul stirring enough without burying it under 10 feet of Hollywood glitz in order to appeal to the superhero crowd. Boo. Hiss.",negative
Harriet,"An extraordinary film about an extraordinary woman who did some extraordinary things in extraordinary ways to make an extraordinary difference to the extraordinary people she helped and saved - absolutely extraordinary!As with all biopics, they seldom present a verbatim account of the life of their subject, it's not a documentary after all. On this occasion forgivable, especially if it results in a wider audience and that audience goes on to explore further the life of this remarkable lady and shares their discovery with others.",positive
Everest,The hype surrounding this movie made we want to go see a fantastic action drama with awesome camera work.I didn't get any of it.Characters were shallow and the chance to show us a 3D spectacle were hopelessley missed.I felt I didn't care about the rich people wanting to do something real and felt as if there wasn't enough in the story about the local people or way of life.Not so much a disaster movie as a disaster.So much potential wasted .,negative
Everest,"A movie that's as stunning and as majestic and as spellbinding as mount Everest itself. Even for many of us who've never been to Nepal, just the fact that Everest is the world's highest mountain requires us to respect it from afar. And I think that's what this film by director Baltasar Kormakur has accomplished, it respects the story, it respects the nature and it respects the memories of the lives lost during that tragic 1996 expedition.Baltasar is an Icelandic filmmaker who knows how to shoot a film in such an environment where the weather can be unpredictable and it can go against you at anytime. He didn't want all of this movie to be shot entirely in a studio, this is not entirely visual effects work, they actually went to Nepal and some of the other locations include Val Senales, Italy. It's out there in the elements, outdoors locations that force even the actors themselves to leave their trailer comfort zone behind. And that is evident on screen, it really shows, because every single frame successfully makes us the audience feel like we're there, we feel the danger, as if we're there climbing the mountain, feeling the pain that comes with excruciating cold because human bodies aren't design to survive such temperature. I think the timing of the arrival of this movie could not have been more perfect. If EVEREST was made a decade or fifteen years ago, for example, when filmmaking technology and the cameras weren't as advanced, I'm not sure if it could've given us a movie-watching experience of this quality. This is not a heist thriller ala 1993's ""Cliffhanger,"" this is an epic survival drama.Many of us are familiar with Jon Krakauer's book, ""Into Thin Air"" since he himself was one of the climbers, but this movie is not an adaptation, because it's also loosely inspired by other accounts, other books about that same expedition, so in a way, what the scribes William Nicholson and also Simon Beauty and filmmaker Baltasar gave us is a reimagining but one that captures the essence and I think that's what the actors themselves aimed to do. Josh Brolin, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Jason Clarke, all of them play these real characters that have families, some may have personal issues, and so the backstory or who's waiting for them on the other side of the world serve as an emotional anchor and a driving force. But you only get a glimpse of it, the script doesn't spend too much time in every last one of them, there are too many grounds to cover, so it provides just enough and then brings the attention back to this whole man vs. nature, this ordeal at hand, all over again, just like one of the characters says in the movie, ""The last word belongs to the mountain."" EVEREST movie does make me wonder why anyone would want to climb mount everest, but it's basically the same as asking ourselves why we do certain things, why we choose to attempt to conquer certain goals, whatever they may be, whether it's the need to inspire and be inspired, whether it's trying to escape our problems, whether it's the love of the climb, EVEREST goes to show that that desire could be both prideful and humbling.",positive
On the Basis of Sex,"I was so excited to see the movie but it was a true disappointment! She was emotional and angry for the first and half hours- The husband and her daughter are stars and need to calm her all the times- I think the documentary is much better than this. Anyway, it is a good story and the camera is good. Just not a good movie",negative
On the Basis of Sex,"My wife and I, both professionals about 15 years behind the real RBG, found this movie both fascinating and painful--almost as painful as the negative reviews that object to the Subject on the basis not of sex, but of politics. Too bad the knuckle-draggers can't get past their own biases to enjoy this very good and intellectually engaging movie. And yes, we did find it suspenceful. My wife, too got directed to the typing pool after four years of college and three of grad school, and I hope I was half as supportive as Marty. We thoroughly enjoyed this reminder that even today the arc of history doesn't bend itself, and that the only way to achieve your goals, especially (gasp) equality, is to keep pushing. And we thought the acting was first-rate, and loved the physical mismatch of the tiny Jones and towering Hammer.",positive
The Disaster Artist,"Tommy Wiseau's move The Room holds a special spot in my heart. Not because it was a cinematic masterpiece, but instead i was able to find entertainment in a constant mess of a movie. Over the years, I've learned a lot of quotes from the movie, all the hidden details and as many behind the scenes info as possible. I was filled with excitement for seeing The Disaster Artist come to life as a The Room fan but even the curiosity of a solid comedy.Greg (Dave Franco) is a young timid actor trying to find his footing as a actor, and becomes fascinated by the fearless actor in his class Tommy (James Franco). They grow a personal brotherly bond and Tommy influences Greg to go off to Los Angeles with him to be big stars. As they begin to feel every door closed in their face, they begin to create their own movie with Tommy's bottomless account. And it wouldn't be long until the movie spirals into chaos and turns into something they never expected.James Franco does a great job as Tommy. A character like Tommy is virtually impossible to play by many people, but he gets as many of his mannerisms, laughs and off beat personality down. As a director, James never lets the movie laugh at Tommy all the time, but he does still inject some empathy for Tommy's bond with Greg, and when the world pointing at his incompetence. He's not afraid to call out Tommy either for his questionable decisions on set and how he treated his crew. There was one great line of dialogue said that the actor believes that Tommy's movie is about ""how the universe betrayed him"", and it actually opened my view of The Room after 5 years knowing this movie.As for any setbacks, they mostly fall in a bit of a checklist feel. While it was great seeing iconic moments in the movie played out, a couple moments don't really connect to the plot as well as others. Also the third act has a bit of a ""Hollywood"" slight sappy moment that feels a little rushed in emotion.The Disaster Artist is far from a disaster and I'm happy as The Room fan to say. It's insanely hilarious, it's hearts in the right place and shows how sometimes our art can take us in places we don't expect. Rating: 9.6 / 10",negative
The Disaster Artist,"The Disaster Artist is absolutely incredible. I don't want to go into detail because honestly this is one of those movies that is best seen relatively blind. What I will say is that the performances are great, the chemistry between Tommy and Greg is pitch perfect, and Seth Rogen and the rest of the supporting cast do an excellent job. The tone of the film is absolutely spot on. The last scene of this movie, and what comes after the end card, absolutely blew me away; this film is so much fun. I just saw this movie, and I already want to see it again. I rarely say this, but I can't think of literally anything this movie could've done differently that would've made it better. Everything it set out to do is done incredibly well. I highly, highly recommend this film. 10/10",positive
Lone Survivor,"Lone Survivor, the movie, is based on a (supposedly) true story. The source of that story is the book with the same title by Marcus Luttrell, who was indeed the sole survivor of a four-man SEAL team in the mountains of Afghanistan. Endorsing this movie requires ignoring basic military protocols, suspending the laws of physics, and disregarding the capabilities of the human body. The Devil, as always, is in the details.Love of country and reverence for its armed forces runs deep in the United States. This is as it should be, and is unsurprising. We want to believe in the honor, strength and heroism of our men in battle. It is, therefore, relatively easy for a film maker to successfully appeal to our emotions. For example, in the case of this movie, the Director Peter Berg makes it very painful for the viewer to watch as our men are cut down and fighting till the end; the viewer is also inspired. The emotions squeezed from the audience makes almost irrelevant the actor's craft. Instead, we are preoccupied with the images of our bloodied countrymen fighting for their lives.This movie further muddies the water about the catastrophe that the SEALs brought down on themselves. Now we have to contend with the movie, the book, and military reality. Most of us will have a grossly distorted view of that reality by way of Schwartzenegger-like movies, or this one, Lone Survivor.In some ways, this movie improves on realism when compared to Mr. Luttrell's book of fantasies. The Director seems to have found Mr. Luttrell's imaginings too hard to accept. For example:1. MOVIE: When the Afghan goatherds are taken prisoner, the commanding officer (Lt. Murphy) decisively orders that the prisoners not be killed in cold blood, and sets them free.Mr. Luttrell says in his book that there was a vote taken on whether to kill the prisoners, and the author plays a starring role--as he does throughout his book--in the final vote to release them.2. MOVIE: The Lt. Murphy character recognizes that their mission has been compromised and so orders his team to move to higher ground and seek extraction ASAP.Mr. Luttrell says in his book that his team merely moved a few hundred meters, and continued the mission.3. MOVIE: Jumping over cliffs was kept to a minimum--two, I think.Mr. Luttrell describes, in his book, jumping over cliffs and down slopes 6, 7, 8, 9 times or more, with nary a broken bone, and an unsecured weapon close at hand.Unfortunately, the Director chose to accept Mr. Luttrell's wild (and unsupported) claim of 200 enemy soldiers poised to engage the SEALs. In the movie, the SEAL team actually see 200 armed enemy in the village. Mr. Luttrell, in his book, sees 80-100 enemy directly above his position--and notes each enemy soldier's armament; he later just assumes the estimate of 200 in all. Mr. Luttrell has remarkable observational abilities. The number of enemy is vastly reduced in the SEALs' own commendations. Furthermore, other very respected sources give the number of enemy as 8- 10. The SEALs placed themselves in a textbook, tactically worst-case position. A single enemy rifleman could have been fatal to one or more members of that SEAL team.The Afghans in this movie are shown as ambulatory targets, without a hint of soldierly virtue. They know nothing of cover, or how to aim a weapon. Yet, they discovered the precise location of the SEALs, maneuvered on them, and caught them flat-footed.In both the sanitized version (the movie), and in Mr. Luttrell's book, the SEALs' incompetence and disregard for basic military principles is manifest. War is unforgiving, and the SEALs paid the logical price. We should not forget, too, that their failures cost the lives of 16 other American servicemen. Had Lt. Murphy survived, rather than Mr. Luttrell, he should have been court-martialed.",negative
Lone Survivor,"If you read the book and heard the interviews with the actual ""lone survivor"" you know that this movie got as close to the real events as possible. The 4 actors really gave it their all. Beginning long before shooting when they started their training so they would look realistic. This movie is also the most visceral experience since ""Saving Private Ryan"". There were falls in this movie that actually hurt more just watching than when I broke my foot 2 years ago. And in the making of you see that crazy stunt people actually did those falls, supposedly without dying. It's of course impossible to spoil this movie given it's title but it's important to note that the guy who helped him risked his whole village for ""The Americans"" Safety. And he didn't think twice about it. Sometimes we forget that not all of them are Taliban. After all is said and done this is a must see if there ever was one.",positive
A Hidden Life,I love Terrance Malick and I was honestly really excited to see this movie but it bored me to tears. Franz' story was very moving and incredible but the subject wasn't something that could be stretched into 3 hours. The imagery was beautiful and the acting was good but not a lot really happened. It was kind of a huge slog with a lot of voice overs of people reading letters. I'm sad I'm giving this movie such a negative review but it was just such a disappointment.C,negative
A Hidden Life,"""Better to suffer injustice than to do it...""I don't have many words tonight. A lot of thoughts and emotions. I didn't expect a perfect score from me this year, but I am just floored and overwhelmed by the visual poetry and spiritual magnitude of it all. It feels transcendent. With a beauty that permeates all the way to one's own relationship with God.Based on true events, A Hidden Life is Malick's most direct exploration of faith since To the Wonder, and perhaps his most fully realized work yet. It is an allegorical story about a man of extraordinary faith. A real-life parable of perseverance and free will. A spiritual journey centered in not just our humanity, but on what it means to truly walk the steps of Christ. And on what it means to choose what we believe is right and just, when we are given every reason not to.Malick doesn't glorify the central character's ideals or deeds. Rather we focus on the humble threads of love and the storm they weather--and the romantic chemistry is perfect. August Diehl & Valerie Pachner are both exceptional and so incredibly in love. Seconds into the film and you already know it. Pachner gives a particularly moving performance deserving of an Oscar nomination (she is in SF this week doing Q&A's!). Every touch, glance, or embrace between these two is personal, powerful, believable. You can see the stress leave their shoulders each time they first see each other. Sincerity fills the screen as their thoughts, worries, desires, and personal bond resurface in the context of God.The cinematography is superb, with DP notably credited to Jörg Widmer and not Emmanuel Lubezki. There is a rare seamless quality achieved blending in old footage as well as in choosing to entirely forgo subtitles in a film spoken in equal parts English and German. The music is the best I've heard all year. A beautiful traditional theme by James Newton Howard (Blood Diamond, TDK) with Handel, Dvorak, and other great classical works mixed in.A Hidden Life is a film that may stay with you for some time. This is quintessential Malick, joining the ranks of The Thin Red Line and The Tree of Life. Go in with an open mind and heart, ready for a spiritual experience.",positive
Fighting with My Family,Not fully aware of paige and her families history and due to that i may have fewer things i dislike about it. The movie was pretty good for a casual fan you will obviously know some things were added to make it more interesting although a little bit more effort could have been added. Zelina Vega in no way represented AJ Lee from her look our even attire which i felt they may have gotten lazy on. Overall pretty decent movie felt a bit rushed and like some info was left out but was a nice attempt at putting a biopic of sorts together on a person who doesnt have extended history and a long list of memorable events in her career. I think a few other female superstars could have shined better with something like this but for what it was worth it was watchable.,negative

Capone,"We've seen many great performances put to screen by Hardy, beginning with Bronson, which gave him the attention he needed, and ending with this one.But with Capone, it was really only Hardy, plus Linda Cardellini's (with little screen-time) usual great work. We've seen many great acting talents wasted on poor screenplays and directing, which we hope not to see in the likes of Tom Hardy.His only Oscar nomination was while working with a great director in Alejandro Iñárritu, but that was only it. If he takes the Leonardo DiCaprio route and only work with great directors (e.g. Scorsese, Tarantino, Nolan, Spielberg and Cameron), we would most definitely see the best in him, and him getting the appreciation he deserves.We don't know what was intended with this movie, but whatever they had planned, Hardy did just enough to make it work. It may seem as an unconventional parodying performance, or just absolute madness-portraying.If you appreciate great acting, watch this movie. Otherwise, you might want to look out for better plot experiences.",negative

Bad Education,"I watched this for about 30 minutes, and was bored out of my mind. I assume there was a point to the movie but I have no idea what it was. What was the clincher was a scene where Jackman was kissing some dude. No thank you. I don't need to see that.",negative

The Founder,"Michael Keaton gives an award worthy performance as burger mogul Ray Kroc. The burgers sizzle as does Keaton who carries this story on his back and keeps this bio pic extremely interesting.Kroc comes across as a ruthless devil as he eventually takes everything from the original well acted burger brothers. The relationship with the next wife Joan is played just subtle enough.The period look is outstanding. The cars, clothes, and people are perfect. A great script well directed and acted makes for an excellent movie.The movie is in limited release and doesn't need a big screen. It's a small movie that will play well on home platforms. Even vegetarians will sink there teeth into this juicy piece of story telling.",negative
The Founder,"McDonald's has been one of if not the most influential brands in the world. It has been a staple of not only American fast food but American life, whether you like like it or not. Going into The Founder I did not know a lot Ray Kroc, other than that he was in some way involved with the mega chain. Turns out Kroc is a real piece of work, and while there were things about this story that interested me, overall what we get is the tale of an asshole and how he succeeded in screwing some people out of a lot of money. This is where the movie runs into its main problem, half the time it feels like praying at the alter of Kroc, and the other half feels like a pulled punch to the gut of ultra-capitalists.The first act tells about Kroc struggling as a milkshake mixer salesman, when he discovers a restaurant unlike any of the others that he has visited. The speed of service, the consistency of the quality of the food and the way it brought the community together draws Kroc to the burger shack known as McDonald's. The rest of the movie plays out with Kroc slowly bleeding the McDonald brothers of their company and really the original intention of the restaurant. Kroc did implement some innovations that pushed McDonald's into a worldwide franchise, but these moments mostly come after the events of the movie. The innovative ideas that we do see are almost exclusively created by the McDonald brothers, who as previously stated basically get screwed the whole movie.Michael Keaton is probably looking right back at you from both sides of the screen right now, so you have probably figured out he plays an important role here. Keaton plays it with his normal light comedy tone, which would work perfectly if the movie had embraced it more. I have no idea what Ray Kroc is like so I really don't know if he was anything like Keaton's performance, but darn it if he is not enjoyable to watch. When Kroc begins his descent into jerk off Keaton is professional enough to pull off the switch in character just enough to keep the original idea of him intact. For the most part everyone else just pops in and out. Nick Offerman and John Carrol Lynch play the McDonald brothers who come and go quite regularly, again mostly getting screwed. Poor Laura Dern plays Kroc's first wife, who is relegated to the bummer at home. She never gets to be anything but disappointing which in turn, is disappointing.The McDonald brothers main concern for franchising their restaurant, which had taken them years to perfect just the way they wanted it was that the quality of the food would suffer and thus the name would suffer. Now some 60 odd years later it is funny to think about how that is exactly what happened, and there in lies the main problem with The Founder. There is no critical look at the moves Kroc made. They don't fully back his decisions, but they also don't condemn them. This movie needed a side to take, with it stuck in the middle the story becomes so much less than it could have been. It's like if The Big Short did not make up its mind when it comes to the bankers that caused the financial meltdown.My final thoughts on the movie are pretty simple, there is an interesting story here, where in some ways the world was changed for the better, and some for the worse. I just don't believe it was told in the right way, and while not an incredibly important tale was one that was not difficult to sit through. at an hour and 55 minute run time, The Founder just sneaks under the magic 2 hour mark, but honestly could have been about 15 minutes shorter. There was something here, but with the tone of the movie stuck on the fence, The Founder is pretty forgettable.",positive

Lion,"""Lion"" (2016 release from Australia; 118 min.) is ""based on a true story"", we are reminded at the beginning of the film, and brings the incredible story of Saroo. As the movie opens, we are in ""Khandwa, India, 1986"", and we see 5 yr. old Saroo and his older brother doing whatever they need to do to get by, hustling and bustling. During one of their outings, they get separated and Saroo mistakenly ends up on a train bound for Calcutta, 1000 mi. away. He desperately looks for his mom and his brother, to no avail (for one thing, the boy speaks Hindi and not Bengali), and eventually ends up being adopted by a couple in Tasmania, Australia... To tell you more of the story would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is the big screen adaptation of Saroo's memoir ""A Long Way Home"", and is directed by Australian newcomer Garth Davis. The movie can be roughly divided into two parts: in the initial 50 or so minutes, we follow the young Saroo as he gets separated from his family and eventually ends up in Calcutta. The second half of the movie brings us the grown-up Saroo, now fully integrated in Hobart, Tasmania in his adopted family. I personally LOVED the first half of the movie, which is truly heartbreaking as we follow young Saroo. There is little dialogue to speak of (remember, Saroo doesn't speak or understand Bengali), and in a way this is the truest survivor story you will ever see. The young actor portraying 5 yr. old Saroo is nothing short of sensational. The photography is gorgeous throughout. Things are not nearly as interesting in the movie's second half. Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire; Best Exotic Marigold Hotel) portrays the grown-up Saroo, and does so with pained passion. The same cannot be said of Rooney Mara's performance. I love most of the stuff she does, but here she looks strangely aloof in the proceedings, like she wasn't interested at all in this role (other than it being filmed on location in Tasmania). Nicole Kidman plays the adoptive mother. And am I the only one who was bothered with the way the movie becomes one long advert for Google Earth? On the plus side, there is an outstanding orchestral score, courtesy of Hauschka (!) and Dustin O'Halloran which I intend on seeking out (the movie also features a brand new Sia song ""Never Gives Up"" which plays over the end credits). A few weeks ago I heard an interview on NPR with the real life Saroo, discussing the film (and unfortunately giving away the entire story including how it all ends). Despite that, I was eager to see the movie.""Lion"" opened at the Toronto International Film Festival to good critical acclaim, and it finally opened in theaters in late December. The New Year's weekend matinée screening where I saw this at was attended quite nicely. I thought that the first half of the movie was nothing short of riveting, if heartbreaking, but the second half of the movie is too obvious and predictive too keep my attention all the way through. Still, this is an incredible story that is worth seeking out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",negative

The Lost City of Z,"This is the first review I have ever contributed to IMDb which I use on a regular basis to inform my viewing choices but I feel compelled to write it as the high ratings are so unjustified I feel I have a duty to share my experience and balance the 7.4 (!!!!) score. I went into this with high expectations... every ingredient was present to potentially make this my new favourite movie, unfortunately the script and narrative (if they originally  had one at all) failed to deliver.My main problem was the narrative. The story takes place over a few decades and follows the efforts of Fawcett to discover the ""Lost City of Z"". He embarks on 3 ""perilous"" expeditions going up the Amazon but no sense of danger or suffering is at any point conveyed by the narrative. The 3 trips are each expedited under 20 minutes of screen time. We have absolutely no idea of the time involved (apparently the expeditions lasted a few years each) nor any feeling towards the hardships the crew faces. To make matters worse, new crew members keep appearing out of nowhere and at some point even a horse!! which was nowhere to be seen on the raft in previous scenes. If this was not enough.... the raft keeps going downstream when they are supposed to go UPSTREAM, towards the source of the river.... oh well, I could have lived with these inconsistencies if I had a character to root for. Unfortunately we never feel any sympathy towards any of the protagonists. The character development is non existent and not helped by the fact the acting is very stiff at the best of time and downright awful for most of the movie. I didn't find Charlie Hunnam convincing as a Hell's Angel in SOA but he is seriously laughable as an English Army officer. This absence of feeling and empathy is also to be experienced towards the wife and children he leaves behind, every time he embarks on one of those trips. We simply do not care for them.I obviously did not go into it expecting a new Fitzcarraldo or Apocalypse Now but for a movie which should have dealt with a man's obsessive doomed quest for a Lost City, the jungle and/or the river should have been part and parcel of the movie, a character in itself, an omnipresent entity. No such thing. The whole movie could have been shot in a winter garden for all I saw... You never have the feeling you are in the mud with the protagonists. The only feeling you experience is one of utter detachment and an urge for the movie to finish as soon as possible. Extremely disappointed. Do not believe the hype!",negative
The Lost City of Z,"This is a wonderful film that restores faith in the traditional art of movie making. Richly shot on 35mm by DoP Darius Khondji, every frame feels like an exquisite painting, carefully constructed by a filmmaker at the top of his game in James Gray. The backdrops of England, the Western Front and Amazonia all have interest on every inch of the screen and yet for all this color and texture, it is the characters that leave you thinking long after exiting the theater.Charlie Hunnam, as Col. Percy Fawcett, is adequate and measured, but it is star turns from Sienna Miller (Percy's wife), Robert Pattinson (companion Henry Costin), and a ruddy cheeked and opulent Angus MacFadyen (wealthy explorer James Murray) that make the film. The haunting struggle and draw of the jungle and the world Percy leaves behind is revealed through committed portrayals of three dimensional characters who are both authentic to their era and yet still relevant in 2017. And that is the theme that is so skillfully woven throughout the film by Gray, the conflict of portraying the ""other"" as whole and independent in a world that simplifies and condescends. That Gray could make a story about an early 20th Century British explorer resonate so profoundly with the world we live in today, shows that this is his finest work to date. All lovers of cinema should see it, but anyone able see it from a beautiful 35mm print should definitely not miss the opportunity. This is filmmaking as it is supposed to be.",positive

The Theory of Everything,"This movie completely misses the mark. The world is interested in Stephen Hawking for his scientific contributions to the world. The fact he has a horrible illness is incidental. This movie drags the viewer through the weeds of Hawking's pain and suffering and never let's up until the final minutes of the movie. It was exhausting to watch and leaves the viewer with no real answers to the questions they came to better understand, explore and enjoy. For example, questions like these never get addressed what exactly are Hawking's contributions? How have they shaped thinking and helped develop a better understanding of the universe? Why was Hawking's PhD thought to be so magnificent and why did Hawking later seek to disprove his original theory? Did he disprove the original theory? How has Hawking been able to live so long despite a two year prognosis given in 1963? What lead Hawking to consider the existence of god?Hawking is played by Eddie Redmayne who does a fabulous job making you feel as though you are watching Hawking himself.This movie is about a man with a horrible illness who happens to be a magnificent scientist. The story should have been told the other way around.",negative
The Theory of Everything,"We are all familiar with the story and with Steven Hawking. His groundbreaking work 'A brief History of Time' and devastating disabilities propelled him irrevocably into the public consciousness and immortal fame.But few of us could understand the complexities of his personal life and the shocking divorce in 1990 from his long sacrificing wife of more than 25 years. Indeed that episode served to darken his reputation in the minds of many, including myself, who felt ill at ease with anyone who could leave a partner who had done so much for him just at the long awaited moment when international fame and recognition finally arrived.This wonderful production, so well scripted and paced throughout, serves to explain that vital anomaly in Hawking's life. And it is made all the more poignant as it is based upon the account written by his wife who has borne so much.But it is the breathtaking performance of Eddie Redmayne as Hawking that simply blasted this film into an extraordinary level. It is difficult enough to mimic so famous a person as Hawking and it is even more difficult to portray so accurately the debilitating and gradually increasing effects of Motor Neuron Disease. But to transmit so clearly the profound emotions and inner suffering that Hawking must have experienced in his agonizing journey was a performance that left me quite speechless and at times in uncontrollable tears.It would be a travesty of the industry if Eddie Redmayne is not nominated for an Oscar after this performance. And to my mind it was a work of art that simply cannot be equaled let alone beaten.Have a good handkerchief ready to hand.",positive
"I, Tonya","I, Tonya (Directed by Craig Gillespie and written by Steven Rogers) is a ground-breaking new film about the unstated class system in America.I, Tonya is that rare movie that puts you, the audience, into the center of what the movie is about.I, Tonya tells the story of what really happened when a world-class ice skater from the wrong side of the tracks had her main rival whacked, literally.I, Tonya tries to do for film what Picasso did for art and William Faulkner did for the novel - to capture reality from more than one side, one point of view.OK, this movie works on so many levels, every time I started to write this review, I kept changing it. So I decided to use all of them because that is what this movie is about: reality in all of its many dimensions.The story is simple and one that many of you will remember. Tonya Harding (Margo Robbie) was a great American ice skating champion who was the first woman to do a triple axel (three and a half rotations) during a competition. Nancy Kerrigan (Caitlin Carver) was a great American ice skating champion and in direct competition with Harding for the Ice Skating Champion of the 1994 Olympics. One day, coming from practice, Kerrigan is whacked in the knee by an unknown assailant.What is not so simple is the world that Harding came from. Her mother (Allison Janney) is one of the great Dearest Mommy mothers ever portrayed in film. And she even hits Nancy with a hair brush. The more success Nancy has, the more her mother insists that it is because she pushed and slammed and even knifed Nancy to be the best.When Nancy meets Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan), she is only 15 years old, but she desperately needs someone to love her and Jeff is it. Sadly, he, too, cannot keep his slaps and punches to himself and worse, he is not too bright. When Nancy tells her mother that she and Jeff are going to be married, her mother advises, ""Jeff has a friend who is even dumber than he is, Sean (Paul Walter Hauser). When Nancy gets a death threat just before the American championships, Sean suggests that they get back at Tonya's biggest competitor, Nancy Kerrigan, by doing the same to her. From such stupid, small ideas comes a scandal that made tabloid news seep into mainstream news so that today, one cannot tell one from the other. In 1994, Tonya became the second most recognized person in the world behind President Bill Clinton.The story is told by the major characters in interview format that is inter-spliced with action scenes of what is being described. Director Gillespie keeps switching the format so that we are constantly being thrown from one person's reality to another's. By the time we get to 'the incident' (and Harding tells us, OK, that is what you are all here for), we are not certain who to believe and what really happened. What we are certain about is our complicity in the circus that surrounded the tragedy of Harding's life. As she tells us, she was abused all of her life and (looking straight into the camera) ""lastly by you.""The acting is some of the best you will see this year. Robbie is incredible. The makeup, the spectacular skating of Harding and, especially, the parental and spousal violence are so real that they make us understand more than ever that the movies are now at a stage where they can create reality, any reality, that they want to create. What is real becomes just as nebulous as what is true.I, Tonya is about class, both as in classy and as in class status. Harding was from the wrong side of the tracks and her 'class' is not something she could hide any more than she could hide her ambition. As she continues to be the best female ice skater in America, but is never named the best by judges for the American Ice Skating Association, her frustration mounts until she finally confronts a judge in a parking lot who is visibly scared of her. He admits that her mediocre scores have nothing to do with her skating but rather they are because the Association does not want her to be the face of American Ice Skating.In the irony to end all ironies, that is exactly what Tonya Harding becomes.",negative
"I, Tonya","Anyone who was old enough to be sucked in by the media circus that this scandal turned into should make it a point to take a look at this film, in my opinion.The media seemed much more about the sensationalism of it all than it was about maintaining the kind of objective balance that'd presume Tonya's innocence until evidence proved otherwise. 
But being honest, even if evidence came along that absolved Harding of any wrongdoing in the Kerrigan attack, how happy would the media have been to report it? Or would we have been to hear it? Because we've got to admit that, although it might not seem very nice, there was quite a bit of fun to be had during the couple months we spent focusing on this Hillbilly girl and her bumbling husband, right? Well with that in mind, what would the thought of her innocence have brought, other than damage to the narrative we were having such fun with? Regardless of where you stand in regards to her innocence, its only fair to acknowledge that her role had been laid out for her pretty much from the get-go. Kerrigan was its hero the moment she became the victim, could we have honestly entertained the notion that maybe Harding wasn't as much the villain as seemed to befit the story? How fun would that have been? Really?In the last couple months, the articles about this upcoming movie had comment sections riddled with people mostly bemoaning the current state of Hollywood. Not the scandals, but that it'd even stoop so low as to peddle this kind of white trash story. ""White trash"" came up repeatedly of course, and while comment sections generally aren't the place to find the best sampling of voices, I personally wasn't able to find a single comment that was anything other than damningly derivative of Hollywood and/or Tonya...certainly not one suggesting the possibility that maybe there was more to this story than what we already knew. But that was always a possibility, wasn't it? The telling of a side that we hadn't heard?After seeing the flick last night, I passed along my recommendation of it to a friend, commenting that Tonya Harding's guilt might have to be re-thought. In response, I got a chuckling, ""Oh I have a hard time believing that!"" Which, sure that has to be the prevailing opinion, I'd imagine. 
But why? Do we really and truly think that we have the kind of information on the subject that'd allow for the most objective, fact-based decision on it? Have many of us ever stopped long enough to have wondered whether or not we did? The line of questioning isn't likely to be met with much more than scoffs by those who've yet to view the movie, but they're questions that end up being well begged and something that the same people may find themselves unwittingly exploring afterward. I sure have been.In the meantime, this isn't just a great movie, but a great sports movie, detailing an ice skating prodigy who love for skating drove her life, and whose life ultimately served as a testament to just how influential a class system can be that many of us are barely cognizant of even existing. 
Based off interviews and testimony from the key players in the Kerrigan scandal, watching it brings a much needed sense of balance to the story and will likely leave you amazed at how easily the truth can be blurred when viewed through the lens of sensationalized media coverage. 10/10, great movie that grabs you from its opening scene and will have you entranced throughout.",positive
Togo,"This is the first time that I think Walt Disney Picture did a great job on this amazing movie. A movie that deserves to be called ""Mission Impossible!"" Willem Dafoe and Julianne Nicholson both are great. The screenplay writer Tom Flynn gave us a straightforward plot, simple but amazing scenario that has made this movie so suspenseful, thrilling, at the same time, profound. Director Ericson Core also won my praise wholeheartedly. The special effects team did a wonder too, many scenes I just couldn't believe possible to make, but they just looked so real and so powerful. The crossing lake scenes are just ridiculously fascinating. The leading dog's performance is just beyond any word could describe, and the poppy that played Togo's younger age would allow you to understand what ""cute"" really means. Willem Dafoe, what a great actor! Julianne Nicholson, her natural talent completely shinning through the whole movie. Every part of this movie is a fulfilled perfection, it also owes to the great casting job, through the lens of the camera, offering you great cinematography, followed by a perfect editing job....The almost impossible mission, the dogs, the great couple and the great town people...all together, have made this movie THE VERY BEST MOVIE at the year end of 2019.Highly recommended!",negative

American Sniper,"First, let me say that Eastwood's direction, Cooper's acting and the screenplay are all competent. Were this film a wholly fictional account of a warrior with special skills put in the service of his comrades it would be quite serviceable, though no more than that.However, here was an opportunity to show the complexities of a man hailed as an American hero; and by complexities, I mean the thoroughly odious aspects of Chris Kyle's character. The man enjoyed killing people, regarding his targets as savages, and he bragged about killing looters in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina - even if he didn't, because we don't know for certain, what kind of man declares proudly his murderous inclinations? In short, he was far from a good man. Dismally, you would never know this from the simple-minded depiction of him as an all American Hero in Eastwood's film.Likewise, there is not a shred of awareness in the film that the US involvement in Iraq might have been illegal and was certainly catastrophic for the Iraqis. The film's approach is to display every Iraqi man, woman and even child as intent on murdering ""good"" American troops and therefore deserving of their fate, both at the end of Kyle's rifle and under the boot of American troops generally.I don't know what Eastwood was thinking when he made this film. Perhaps he saw an easy way to make money by appealing to the misplaced patriotism of some Americans. What I do know is that this is a disgusting film.",negative
American Sniper,"The movies is about Chris Kyle's home life and military career with the US Navy as a SEAL sniper. The movie has some intense moments, containing violent and disturbing scenes. The movie doesn't portray Chris as a Rambo figure but rather a man that deals with the problems all soldiers have to face both overseas and at home. Clint Eastwood who is in his mid-eighties, shows us he still has it, directing an amazing film. The movie tells Kyle's story the way he told it in the first book. Overall, American Sniper is a great movie that has all the components, that make a movie great. For anyone who is a war film enthusiast, this is a movie for you. To those who call Chris Kyle a murderer and baby killer, I believe you fail to understand what soldiers sacrifice to protect our liberties and keep us free.",positive
Rush,Niki Lauder is among the most well known personalities in the history of Formula One. Even today millions of Germans watch his TV presentation at every race. We know his manner and speech extremely well and any actor portraying him faces an uphill if not impossible task. But Daniel Bruhl delivers a performance so wonderfully convincing in his faithful and profound portrayal that he should clearly be among the Oscar nominees for Best Actor. The story of Lauda's famous struggle with Hunt in 1976 has become the stuff of legends. And perhaps this production has used some artistic license to enhance them. But the film isn't really about the thrilling story of those events. That's just the vehicle for a much deeper drama examining the ever relevant dialectic between hedonism and pragmatism. It's about the self beneath the skin rather than the glamor of the surface: a concept normally quite alien to the Oscar awarding Hollywood elite. So poor Daniel Bruhl must await another vehicle to display his superb talents. And one day he might be remembered internationally in his career as Niki was himself.,negative
Rush,"Just come out the cinema in York from watching Rush! Oh my god! One of the most intense films I have watched in a very long time with gripping performances from Hemsworth and Brühl! An extremely clever script from Peter Morgan in which he doesn't pick sides, but instead allows the audience to view these characters in their own light.I am a huge fan of F1 so when viewing a film relating to that sport it would be questionable that there are some anachronisms or minor problems. But no! There was not a single fault with this film, it is the most realistic sports film I have viewed! A film that portrays the rivalry between the British and Austrian world champions and the fateful crash. With some powerful dialogue from Lauda and Hunt.Even if you aren't a fan of F1, the intense action and no-holds adrenaline should keep you entertained from start to finish. With a great sway of emotions from melancholy to ecstatic! This film deserves the acclaimed reviews it has been receiving.",positive
Legend,"First off, hats off to the acting in this film - the cast did an amazing job. I was worried when I saw the trailer but I gave it a chance and I'm so glad I did. Truly a very well put together film, with a plot that carried it through and several audience members including myself cried at times. It showed the brothers in a different light. Allowing the audience to love them, hate them, sympathise and empathise with them. Tom hardy played both brothers excellently and hats off to the supporting actress who played Frances Kray - she did a fantastic job. A film you could re-watch again and again, the atmosphere and the wardrobe were key aspects of this film and the director delivered on pulling out all the stops. The script was beautifully written. That said, I'd ask you to remember that this film is from one take on the Krays, they were a complex pair and short of holding a séance, we will never know what went on in their minds - this film is an adaptation of an account. Though in my own opinion it was probably the most accurate hollywood portayl that has been produced to date.Judge it on what you see, don't waste time with trailers that spoil parts for you. Buy a ticket and some popcorn and enjoy!",negative
Legend,"Tom Hardy is Brilliant in this and after a while you forget that he is acting both roles as Reggie and Ronnie. Nothing much new in this apart from the tragedy of Reggie's wife Frances and that is the slant that they put on this otherwise well known story, but it is in fact Hardy's portrayal of Ronnie that is most outstanding. he captures the true madness of the man without becoming a caricature.His portrayal of Reggie was also pretty much spot on and showed how he struggled with wanting to be a successful businessman but unable to escape his violent side.Without Tom Hardy's exceptional acting though the movie would have been pretty dull.",positive
Official Secrets,"This film is based on a true story of a woman working for the British government who leaked a document to the press so that the Iraqui war might not happen. In case you've forgotten, that war was started under the false premise that Iraq had ""weapons of mass destruction"" and they were planning to use them with anti-western forces top launch attacks. Both allegations were blatant lies, trumped up by the Bush administration, but at the time, many people believed them and in fact, the US and the Brits went to war with hundreds of thousands of casualties.The film is slow paced but the acting is excellent, especially from Ralph Fiennes who seems to utterly disappear into his roles. It's a case study of someone being willing to stand up for what she believes regardless of the consequences. There are precious few people like this, so every film that chronicles their struggle deserves to be seen.",negative
Official Secrets,"If you want to become freshly enraged about the massive war crime we call the Iraq war, go see this film. Perhaps the most emotionally distressing aspect is the underlying knowledge that absolutely nothing has changed on any level of power, in any way, since this extraordinary deception.Bush and Blair continue to be celebrated in high society.Intelligence agencies continue to illicitly gather compromising material to use as blackmail and extortion on people who might stand in the way of this war-for-profit gravy train.We continue to be deliberately and criminally deceived about these so-called humanitarian wars by a media that continues their fawning sycophantic support of the war-loving establishment.The butchery-for-Raytheon profits continue with no end in sight.It's a great yarn well told, Knightly is perfect as Katharine Gun, and it has a lot of very interesting old footage from the time which will have you shouting at the screen in frustration. But the effect on most will be excruciating cognitive dissonance between the world we think we live in and the actual power structures that manipulate us into handing our tax money over to kill poor people overseas for geostrategic reasons that benefit no one except the very rich and powerful.",positive
The Highwaymen,"It was about time the movie industry told the truth about who Bonnie and Clyde were. Actually it was overdue. It was terrible how they have been glamorized over the years. They had no regard for human life and actually enjoyed what they did.According to most of what I have read regarding these murdering thieves, this movie was basically historically accurate. Although a few of the main players were not really given their due. There is only so much time allotted I suppose.This was a really great movie. I was glued to the screen. For a movie that is over 2 hours, it actually moved along quickly.Kostner and Harrelson were superb. Both of them were very sympathetic characters. Maybe Harrelson a bit more.Seeing how two men who had the same professional experiences were each affected so differently makes this movie worth watching.The supporting cast was top notch. You only see Bonnie and Clyde for a very few minutes.The cinematography was beautiful. Watching how law enforcement handled such a huge case in the 1930s was interesting. The politics that were involved are no different than today however.This is a film that I highly recommend. You will not be disappointed.",negative

Darkest Hour,"I expected so much more from this film but was totally disappointed. I didn't expect a documentary and any film has to enjoy some literary license but this is a work of sickly perfumed fiction which completely misrepresents the man to the point of unrecognizability. If the film is a portrayal of a man, then it is certainly not Churchill.Churchill has to be understood in the light of his heritage and class. If a peripheral player initially, he was born into the ruling class. Like many only begrudgingly accepted into its ranks, he was therefore one of its strongest proponents. He believed he was born to rule just as much as commoners were born to die in the service of empire. The class system meant that he would never, ever have confided in someone he regarded as a commoner and the notion of him even addressing a black man is ludicrous. He was a committed racist firmly believing it to be the natural order of things. This is the man who, as a boy, simply wrote ""Marlborough"" on his entrance exam to Harrow believing this was enough to gain entry. It was.Churchill was well known for summoning servants and government employees to action while he was toileting or in the bath. This was not because he was accessible, charismatic or comfortable with his body as portrayed in the film. Rather this was a man who simply didn't simply care what they thought because he was Churchill and they weren't.The film quotes Churchill as supporting the marriage of Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson. In actuality Churchill was a pivotal character in opposing the marriage of Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson. Not because she was a divorcee and he was morally outraged (Churchill's father died of syphilis after a lifetime of philandering and his mother used sex as a social tool) but because he knew Edward would resign over it and he vehemently opposed Edwards desire to be an involved monarch. Simpson was widely believed to be having an affair with Von Ribbentrop (Hitlers foreign minister) and Churchill knew Hitler would use this to his benefit against a weak and easily influenced king. Churchill would never have been familiar with George VI and probably privately despised him as a weak and unprepared monarch. The royal family and many of their closest allies were closet supporters of Hitler believing him to be far preferable to the Communists who were a substantially more concrete threat. Churchill was utterly loyal to the throne and monarchy but George VI was only the current incumbent just as Edward VIII before him, had been.The film portrays Halifax and Chamberlain as weak appeasers when in actuality their fears were the loss of a complete generation of men like that experienced in WWI. Horror was embedded deep within many politicians who had seen/survived active service during WWI and were desperate to not revisit that period. Chamberlain is recorded as believing Hitler would most likely break his word but knew he had no choice but to try and gain time for rearmament despite the cost to his own career and legacy.It might not be a convenient truth but, successful evacuation of the troops at Dunkirk was solely because of 'Churchills' flotilla but probably because of Hitlers stated reluctance for a massacre. Hitler did not feel the British were the natural enemy (that was the communists) and that a massacre would negate the possibility of a agreement.If Gary Oldham wanted to be Churchill, then he failed. Churchill was much more imposing, had a deeper voice with substantially more gravitas. Oldhams voice is thin and reedy and, at one point, he even adopts a regional accent. Churchill was a war monger, rude, inconsiderate, terribly ill mannered and selfish but would sacrifice himself in a second for the notion of service and empire. He was not your irascible but charming uncle as portrayed in this film.",negative
Darkest Hour,"At this point, ""Darkest Hour"" has an overall rating of 5.3. I do not understand this at all, but the film has not actually been released yet and has only been seen in film festivals. I assume the overall score will increase considerably--especially since the two reviews for it were quite positive.Now I must point out that I am a retired history teacher and I consider Winston Churchill to be perhaps the greatest politician of the century. So, I clearly have a bias and predisposition towards liking the movie...especially if it's done well. Is it a crowd pleaser? Maybe not, as the average movie-goer (especially teens) might not enjoy this or care a lick about the film.The story covers only a portion of the month of May, 1940...just before the fall of France during WWII. Prime Minster Chamberlain is about to be tossed out of office, as his appeasement strategy with Hitler has turned out to be completely stupid. In his place, some hope for Churchill to be the next Prime Minister...though some forces are working to depose him as soon as he comes to power. At the same time, the war is going as badly as it possibly can. Can Churchill survive this? Well, of course...duh, it's HISTORY!The reasons to see this are two big ones....the film has achieved the look of 1940 beautifully and Gary Oldman provides an Oscar- winning performance in the lead. If he is not at least nominated for this top award, I will be completely shocked...and he really managed (along with ample prosthetics) to LOOK and SOUND like the great man. Great job all around...and a perfect film.",positive
Unbroken,"I cannot begin to list all the things wrong with this movie. Granted the acting was very good, however, it was the longest 2 hours of my life. I kept waiting for something 'good' to happen and it never did. I believe this could have been a wonderful American story, but was nothing short of a huge let down. Really disappointed in how much this movie was hyped up. Painfully slow, and felt like two hours of literal purgatory. I am sure that his true story was much better and could have emphasized what his family was going through at the same time. Or possible they could have shown what the news had reported about him, and what the airforce was doing to look for him. Wish I could erase this one from my memory. The worst part is I feel this man was done a real disservice to his memory and honor.",negative
Unbroken,"I finally rented this movie which I had been avoiding since it was released over a year ago. I am glad I did because it kept my interest throughout. I thought the POW theme would be too depressing which it is but there is no glossing over that. Angelina Jolie has become an admirable director. I don't understand the hate directed towards her. This is an epic movie that is very well done. The film has won it's fair share of awards including three Oscar nominations. The acting is great. I am surprised the movie didn't receive more Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Lead Actor, Best Supporting Actor & Best Director. Also the Coen Brothers should have received more recognition for their screenplay",positive
Hidden Figures,"In 1961, three Black female geniuses ( Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson) work for NASA. We can tell it's 1961 by the ubiquitous pictures of JFK. The three work as human computers doing calculations.Katherine is a mathematician who is basically Einstein without the crazy hairdo. Mean White people are mean to her. They mistake her for a janitor, make her drink coffee from a separate pot, and worst of all, force her to walk half a mile in the rain while carrying a bunch of folders, just to go pee.
Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory is particularly mean to Katherine. He's always trying to take credit for her work. Katherine is clearly the smartest person in all of NASA.
Kevin Costner is Katherine's boss, who destroys the colored bathroom sign, thus freeing up her genius and enabling her to get John Glenn into orbit. John Glenn was in his forties at that time, but the actor playing him looks like Scut Farkas from A Christmas Story. NASA probably would've had to shut down if it wasn't for Katherine. Sheldon ends up subjugated to Katherine and serving her coffee.Dorothy is a mechanical genius who can fix cars just by magically touching the engine with a screwdriver. Kirsten Dunst is mean to Dorothy, and won't let her get a promotion. When NASA gets a new computer, (that is too big to fit through the door), the White doofus programmers don't have a clue how to get the thing to work. Dorothy can get the computer functioning just by magically touching a wire. Dorothy gets promoted to supervisor and gets to act sanctimonious towards Kirsten Dunst. Dorothy is clearly the second smartest person at NASA.Mary is an engineering genius who can't get promoted to engineer because of mean White people. She has to go to court to fight for the right to go to engineering school. The mean White judge really doesn't want to allow her admission into the school, but Mary wins him over with sassy Black girl attitude. I believe she later went on to invent the internet. Mary is clearly the third smartest person at NASA.Hidden Figures is a plodding, predictable, Howard Zinnesque soap opera of Whites oppressing Blacks, which is mostly fictitious. The three women really existed and really did work at NASA. But all they did was work in groups doing tedious calculations in pre computer times. Katherine Johnson stated that she was treated well and didn't face any discrimination. This film is nothing more than post ""Oscar so White"" agitprop. It would almost work as an absurdist comedy if it's intentions weren't so deplorable.Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past. -George Orwell",negative
Hidden Figures,"Appreciation. It's a condition which requires information and understanding and results in increased compassion, acceptance and inclusiveness. There are few ways to enhance appreciation for others more effectively than a well-made movie and the 2016 historical drama ""Hidden Figures"" (PG, 2:07) takes full advantage of that opportunity. Without being too busy or too preachy, this film helps the audience better appreciate the struggles of being a minority – and a working woman (and even a mother working outside the home) – in the early 1960s, the pressure involved in competing with the Soviet Union in the early years of the space race, the difficult challenges surrounding getting man into space (and returning him safely to earth) for the first time and the courage it required of those who were willing to go. That's a lot for one movie – and might be too much for many – but ""Hidden Figures"" is up to the challenge.The film is an adaptation of Margot Lee Shetterly's book of the same name and follows three black women who worked in NASA's computer section in 1961. That's not to say that they worked on computers – THEY were the computers. Back when electronic computers (with only a fraction of the capacity and speed of today's mainframes) took up an entire room – and were just beginning to be installed in places like NASA – talented mathematicians did calculations for the space program by hand.Dorothy Vaughn (Oscar winner Octavia Spencer) is a mathematician who is also mechanically-inclined, develops a talent for programming IBM computers and is a natural leader, but is denied a well-deserved supervisory position by NASA culture – and her supervisor (Kirsten Dunst). Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) is a brilliant mathematician who struggles to balance the demands of her increasing responsibilities at NASA with caring for her three young daughters whose father has passed away. Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) is an outspoken aspiring engineer who is held back from becoming an actual engineer because of her lack of education, which she has difficulty overcoming because of segregation.All three women make progress in their attempts to reach their goals and fulfill their potential, but with much difficulty, based on their gender and their race. Dorothy has been managing the women of the computer section for some time, but has to fight for the title and the pay – and even takes it upon herself to learn more about NASA's newly-arrived IBM computer, while understanding that doing so could eventually cost her and her co-workers their jobs. Mary continues to make valuable contributions to NASA's efforts, while trying to work through the catch-22 of needing additional education to become an engineer, with the only nearby school offering such classes refusing to accept any black students.But most of the screen time belongs to Katherine's story. As the most talented mathematician of all of NASA's human computers, she is called up to work in NASA's Space Task Group where she works directly with the standoffish Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) and is supervised by the group's director, Al Harrison (Kevin Costner). Even as Katherine continues to demonstrate her capabilities, she is still subjected to drinking coffee from a pot labeled ""Colored"" and having to walk 20 minutes (each way) to the building where the nearest restroom for black females is located. Eventually, she earns the respect of her peers – and comes to the attention of astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell) himself, who comes to trust her calculations above all others. Katherine also attracts a different kind of attention from the commander of a local Army Reserve base, Lt. Col. Jim Johnson (Mahershala Ali), who is also single. Embodying the dual meaning of the movie's title, Katherine works out the hidden figures needed for Glenn's mission and Jim doesn't mind that her figure is hidden beneath those unflattering 1960s dresses, as he comes to care more about her heart – and the very sharp mind hidden behind her even less flattering eye glasses.""Hidden Figures"" is a marvelously entertaining film. The script adaptation by Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi tells its true story accurately and engagingly, weaving its many story lines together seamlessly, educating and entertaining their audience throughout. Melfi also directs and uses his talented and award-worthy cast to thrill us, to make us cheer and give us moments of humor and just plain fun. I was impressed at how much this movie packed in without seeming cluttered, how much it affected me emotionally without being manipulative, and how much appreciation I gained for these women, their struggles and the importance of the times in which they lived and accomplished so much. It's also surprising that so little has been widely known about these women – until now. Don't let ""Hidden Figures"" be a hidden treasure. See it soon! It's out of this world. ""A+""",positive
"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile","This was a disgusting portrayal of Bundy. If someone watched this who had never read up on him, they might think he was innocent. This movie is a slap in the face to his victims' families. I don't know how anyone could think he was innocent back then when everywhere he went, bodies of women, all killed in the same manner, started turning up soon after he arrived. How much of a coincidence could that possibly be? He's in Utah- dead girls, he's in Colorado- dead girls, he's in Florida- dead girls that live right down the street. Not to mention, the disappearances stopped after he left Washington State. You'd have to be a complete moron to believe in his innocence. Liz Kloepfer identified him to police twice, also, not just once. She gave the police quite a lengthy interview at one point. She had very strong suspicions that Ted was the murderer. I don't know what this movie was trying to convey, but it was very inaccurate and completely sugarcoated.",negative
"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile","By now, people know about Ted Bundy and what a monster he was. But people who are saying this movie is boring, I believe they are missing the point. It's not about the Gorey details of his crimes, it's about Bundy's relationship with people and how manipulative he was.I am a true crime fan and have always considered myself ""too smart to fall for such evil"", but I have to admit, there were times when I found myself rooting for Ted Bundy and then realized what I was doing. If you let yourself be fully submerged in the movie and toss out any expectations and what you think you know about Ted Bundy, I think you will be pleasantly surprised at what you are able to feel about someone who was a living nightmare. It made me realize why so many women could have actually fallen for Bundy's tricks.",positive
Judy,Renee is just perfect for this role. Her acting is amazing! Her voice is so beautiful. Really enjoy this movie.,negative
Judy,"""Judy"" (2019 release; 118 min.) is a bio-pic about Judy Garland. As the movie opens, we are on the set of ""The Wizard of Oz"", and Judy is getting lectured by creepy ol' studio boss Louis Meyer. We then go to the present (i.e. the late 60s), where Judy can't afford her Hollywood hotel suite and is in essence homeless. Out of sheer desperation, she and her 2 kids end up at Syd, one of her ex-husbands (yes, she has multiple). When a lucrative offer arrives for a series of shows in London, she reluctantly accepts, as her kids are left with her ex... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is a multi-country co-production, and directed by British director Robert Goold, best known for his stage work in London, but he did direct the excellent film ""True Story"" a few years ago. Here he and the production team are bringing a Hollywood legend's waning years and youth to the big screen, so in certainly isn't covering Garland's entire life. Only 2 eras are covered: when she was 15-16, and her London 'comeback' in early 69. In that sense this is not a traditional bio-pic. Is everything that we see on the big screen an accurate reflection of July's life? I haven't the faintest idea. Most of the film plays out in London, and what we see is a frail woman who is world famous yet ever so lonely. She doesn't know who to trust as people left and right are riding Judy's coattails. And what about her youth at MGM? Even then she was manipulated, intimidated, abused, and taken advantage of (the scenes with Louis Mayer are revealing. Of course, we are watching a movie, with full of performances, and hence it needs to be pointed that Renee Zellweger is absolutely astonishing (and almost not recognizable) in the title role. She IS Judy Garland. Now age 50 (and hence perfectly well place to play the then-47 year old Garland), Zellweger brings a career-defining performance, period. On top of that, she does all of her own singing, and does it quite well. I am gong on record that Zellweger will get a Best Actress Oscar nomination for this, I have no doubt about it.""Judy"" premiered at the recent Telluride film festival to immediate acclaim, and the film opened this weekend on not one but two screens of my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was PACKED, I am happy to report. In some of the more moving scenes of the movie, you could hear a pin drop in the theater. If you have any interest in Judy Garland, or are simply a fan of Renee Zellweger, I would readily recommend that you check this out, be it in the theater, or VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",positive
Dallas Buyers Club,"Dallas Buyers Club (2013)What starts as an interpersonal drama with Matthew McConaughey leading the way, ends up as a more hard-hitting social message film with historical roots. It's about survival, accountability, American entrepreneurship, and AIDS. And McConaughey as Ron Woodroof is quite perfect, an amazing role played with a perfect mixture of restraint and excess as required.It's necessary to mention as a secondary play Jared Leto, who plays a transgender woman, Rayon, also with AIDS. Woodroof overcomes his apparent homophobia to embrace Rayon as a partner and friend. Playing this kind of ""type"" might seem easy—like playing a racist sheriff or a grumpy old man—but Leto makes it complex and fair to that kind of person. (By the way, Rayon is fictional and Woodroof is not. The main story is true, including the making of a buyers club based on a model in New York that skirted laws for awhile.)This is a movie ripe for praise and criticism both. It digs into an important subject and turbulent time. It also creates simplified versions of the people and their circumstances. Cries of inaccuracy (especially against the hospital, which is portrayed as pawn in the pharma corporate world) are fair but don't let them distract you. This is a drama, a dramatization, and it's well done to the heels. Beautifully rendered and truly filled with drama.If the two actors deserve the most credit (and by extension the leading woman, a doctor played by Jennifer Garner, does not), the director needs to singled out here for capturing the feel of the times and the place (Dallas, filmed in New Orleans) so well. It's never distracting with affectation even as it is always interesting and colorful. And the story is told well and fast and without unnecessary sentiment.",negative
Dallas Buyers Club,"Much has already been written about Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto's astonishing transformations, and brilliant performances. Solid and true, yes. They both deserve enormous accolades, Golden Globe and AMPAS-worthy, for these transformations and the effort of their craft. But I think the true heroes of this project are the Producers who took a chance on such dicey subject matter. Some reviews hail the project as ""A Crowd Pleaser,"" and yet, you realise, these are TRULY marginal characters, and not entirely likable, as some have already said, in an Era (1970s-1980s early AIDS crisis) that is nearly forgotten in this age of HIV exposure-as-a-managed-care-condition, rather than a death sentence, as it was between 1979-1995. As much as this could be a feel-good film for the discovery and pioneer of protease inhibitor cocktails, it is a compelling character study of a time of crisis that has not been well-captured or documented adequately in quite some time. BRAVO to the Producers of this movie for giving this project the Greenlight, because the sexually-active youth of today would never know the Plague and tragedy that preceded their coming-of-age without a reminder like this.",positive
Free State of Jones,"I enjoyed the movie and would have rated it an 8 but for some pacing issues, including how they awkwardly managed the flash forward scenes to the sub-plot with Newton Knight's descendant.I'm not a history buff, but also not opposed to learn about compelling stories, and this was one. Who knew that there was this sub-war going on in the middle of the Civil War, or about this Lincoln-esque southern guy willing to fight the good fight? Knight was an inspiring guy who somehow saw forest through the trees and had courage to do right in a world with wrong going on all around him.The acting was quite good. I particularly enjoyed fresh faces like Mahershala Ali (Moses) and Gugu-Mbatha Raw (Rachel). The script was not full of period clichés or overly polish, things I appreciated in a movie like Tombstone, but could have been a distraction in Free State which fortunately kept it real.Matthew McConaughey was excellent in the lead as the gritty Newton Knight. Not as gritty as his brother Rooster, but the grit suits him. Very believable. But this is not a movie that shines due to his good looks, rather from his good acting.Some of the more critical reviews made comment about FSoJ as ""hopelessly adrift"", ""trips over its own themes as it stumbles aimlessly,"" ""is confusing"", and ""It's not that the story itself is hard to follow, but Gary Ross' script and direction fail to make clear key personal relationships in the film, and throughout its 2 ¼ hours, it makes the audience wonder where the story is going and whether this movie has much of a point at all."" Wow! All I can tell you is that I did not know the story, and there were some moments where it fumbles, but I kept up with it just fine. For me the movie's strengths far outweighed its weaknesses. Definitely not an average or sub-par movie — the subject matter alone puts it ahead of so many other films.At times I questioned the casting on some of the supporting roles, but that may be Hollywood conditioning thing, and on reflection this cast probably showed what people were like back in that day.After the movie I read up on the Davis Knight story. He was the great grandson who was embattled in a miscegenation trial in 1940s Mississippi. He was 1/8 African American, looked white (in the movie) and married a white woman; a crime back in the day in Mississippi. Have to wonder why they didn't prosecute the white wife. Hmm.It goes to show you how much times have changed: now days in Mississippi Batman can marry Superman, dogs can marry cats, and democrats can marry republicans. You won't see any of that in Raqqa. It's a crazy mixed up world folks.To sum things up, it's not a perfect movie, and there were some issues making it hard to track at times, but a fascinating sub-plot to the real Civil War, it kept my interest, and the acting was good. Any movie that has me reading up on its story after the film has got to be worth seeing.",negative
Free State of Jones,"I had read Prof. Bynum's excellent books about the Jones County rebellion and so had been looking forward to the movie. Though it, inevitably, changes the story (you'd need a dozen hours to tell it completely), it remains faithful to the spirit of the rebellion and the characters of Newton and Rachel Knight.There were a number of Unionist uprisings in the South during the Civil War (a fact that was carefully expunged from my history textbooks, growing up in the South, maybe to justify all the monuments celebrating the glorious Olde South that lurk around public parks and buildings to intimidate black Southerners - I guess). What other purpose could they possibly serve? To celebrate a defeat?This movie finally points out the obvious: the Confederacy lost the war, but the planter class which owned the Confederacy did their damnedest to win the peace. Instead of being lynched like Mussolini, Confederate leaders returned to their lives, their plantations, just like the war had never happened. Even the slaves they lost were returned to them in the form of unpaid sharecroppers. The misery of the lives of freedmen is one of the strongest images to take away from this film, their alleged freedom snatched from them. No 40 acres and a mule to serve as some form reparation, they went on to endure a century of domestic terrorism at the hand of the KKK.The movie itself is beautifully and sensitively acted and filmed. There are scenes of great brutality but which are never gratuitous. There are also scenes of great beauty. There are scenes which have enormous relevance to politics in America today where racism is the hallmark of one Presidential candidate and income inequality the hallmark of another.Claims by the radical left that this movie is about a ""white savior"" are just silly. If anything, Gary Ross has eliminated most of the real-life incidents which dealt with Newton Knight's own actions on behalf of freedmen, probably to make the film more palatable to the radical left who, like the extreme right-wing can never be satisfied anyway. I do wish the radical left, rather than criticizing well-intentioned liberals like Gary Ross, would attack the real enemy. The State of Mississippi still incorporates the Confederate flag in its state flag... and social justice warriors are quibbling about degrees of ""white saviordom""? Matthew McConaughey hasn't put a foot wrong since Lincoln Lawyer and his performance here is among his best work. American actors are rarely convincing playing period roles but he totally inhabits the role - scraggly beard, greasy hair, terrible teeth and attitude. He looks like the daguerrotype of a tired and desperate Civil War soldier. Gugu Mbatha-Raw has flown too long under the radar: stunningly touching as an early 19th century biracial heiress in Belle and totally believable as a pop star headed for a nervous breakdown in Beyond the Lights, she brings a luminous quality to Rachel a resourceful woman who defined her own path despite the oppression of racist Southern culture.Mahershala Ali's character won't be found in Prof. Bynum's books. The names of the maroons who fought with the Knight Company have been lost to history, so he is a composite character invented by Gary Ross. His character travels from runaway slave to armed insurgent to voting rights activist in Reconstruction. Ali imbues his character with wit, charm, warmth and extraordinary courage.Keri Russell is fine in a small role. She gives her heartbroken character dignity and resilience.Highly recommended.",positive
First Man,"The only real distinction of First Man may be that it's the first over-hyped and over-rated film of next year's Oscar crop. It's a film that is dismally defeated by its own subject matter at every turn. First it wants to be an illuminating, insightful study of Neil Armstrong. But on the evidence of everything it offers, Armstrong was simply not that interesting. If the most startling discovery about your hero is that he was sad about his infant daughter's death, then you're already in deep trouble. Nor is it hugely surprising that a guy who is dedicated to preparing for a mission to the moon isn't exactly a well-rounded, socially adept human being. But many a fascinating film has been built around a cerebral, emotionally-distant, socially awkward character, right? True enough, but it takes an actor with a much greater skill set than Ryan Gosling to make such a character interesting. First Man is essentially two hours of Gosling mooching around trying to find some way of making Armstrong's interior life compelling. That he fails isn't entirely due to his own shortcomings as an actor, but to a screenplay that does little more than rely on his good looks and the ""glamour"" of the space race to make Armstrong interesting. But the second big fail of First Man is that it doesn't offer us anything particularly new or interesting about the moon mission. Chazelle's strategy is to eschew the cliches of space movies - the focus on technology and the astronaut's eye view - and stay close on his heroes through interminable sequences in juddering space capsules. There's nothing new about this, other than it being the main, sometimes sole focus. Unfortunately, it becomes tedious long before we get to Apollo 11's trek to the moon. Even the ultimate moon sequence offers little that we don't already know from the grainy footage of the real event that everyone has seen hundreds of times. In short, the term ""epic fail"" could have been invented to describe First Man.",negative
First Man,"Oh well well!! what can i say? its a wonderful movie. if you love sapce films you should watch this.. it shows you all the plots and they are very well organized.. the visual effects, background sounds and acting were awesome..all i can say Ryan Gosling didn't disappoint us..",positive
Just Mercy,"I came away disappointed by the film adaptation of Just Mercy. This is probably a given, but the film adaptation is very overly-dramatized, and not completely true to the story. While this is expected, I find it in this case to be in somewhat poor taste considering everything is a portrayal of real-life people and real-life events.Having read the book, you would see that the racism that actually took place was seriously watered down for the film adaptation. The film also touches on things from the book briefly but not enough to give you the entire picture or depth of the situation. For example, the film also briefly follows Herb, who is being executed for murdering a girl. While the film touches on his PTSD and having been a veteran, and ""making a bomb"", the film doesn't explain, like the book did, that it was illegal for the state of Alabama to execute Herb because he had no intention of killing anyone (he made the bomb as part of a convoluted plan to ""rescue"" his old girlfriend and win her back, but instead the bomb killed her young daughter). The state of Alabama executed him anyway after Stevenson's last minute appeal because it was ""too late"".In the movie, Herb also has ""no family"" and gives his flag to Stevenson. In real life, he was surrounded by family, including a new partner who refused to give him up when he had to be taken away to be executed (by the way, his execution in the film is just a simple ""thud"").I also found Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Walter McMillian to be wildly inaccurate. In the movie, he blows up upon first meeting Stevenson, and comes off as someone who is nonchalant about life at Holman Correctional Facility and knows everything about the decorum there. He even refuses Stevenson's services at first. In real life, Walter was traumatized by the conditions at Holman and during his case was desperately seeking Stevenson's attention over that of his fellow inmates.There are several critiques I have for the film, but I don't want to spoil the central story. I strongly recommend you read the book instead, because you will walk away from it with a much more thorough understanding of our criminal justice system and what's really going on in America.",negative
Just Mercy,"I was born and raised in Alabama. I left the state in 1966 for the Army and Vietnam. The facts of this true story sicken me, they embarrass me and they anger me.Whether it's Walter McMillian in the 1990's Alabama or General Michael Flynn today, miscarriages of Justice and the blatant abuse of power have no place in a civilized society. Perhaps this film will make this clear to those who have difficulty grasping that simple concept.",positive
The Imitation Game,"Nice to watch and main cast play was very on the top, However most of the story is fictional. Alan Turing didn't build Enigma machine, nor he broke the actual code. History wise, Enigma code was broken by three polish cryptologists: Marjan Rejewski, Jerzy Rozycki i Henryk Zygalski. Also according to some posts on internet Alan personality was also altered.As I wrote, The movie in nice and the main actor does very good job however the whole story is very different from reality and information on the front saying that the story is based on Alan Turing live is very misleading.",negative
The Imitation Game,"Truly excellent film and definitely Ocsar worthy material for both the film and the actors. The entire cast are amazing.As Cumberbatch says near the start of the film ""are you paying attention"". You should pay attention, Alan Turing deserves your attention, his story deserves to be told.I went to see this at the London Film Festival last week and I am going to be one of the first ones in the cue to see it when it comes out next month. It is an excellently paced and executed script that has you gripped from beginning to end. The whole audience were laughing and applauding and crying in places, including the man next to me who had to borrow a hankie from his wife.The film switches between the drive of the team of code breakers to solve the Enigma code, young Alan Turing and the events after the war that destroyed his life. It is truly heartbreaking in places, and Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Alan Turing is outstanding. He really deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance.It has been a very, VERY long time since I enjoyed a film so much, that when I came out of the Cinema I wanted to turn right round and go back in and watch it again. A lovely script that had you switching back and forwards between tears and laughter.I know some wanted a more in depth and in detail look at Alan Turing's life and have commented frequently that this does no focus enough on his sexuality or the events after the war.In this case I think less is more, this film highlights the man and the mind. It shows us the genius that was destroyed by a society that was seriously homophobic. It brings to life the man behind the facts and we laugh at his interactions with his fellow code breakers and cheer as he proves his theories and our hearts break as we watch him try to cope after his court case.One of the best films I have seen in a long time. Go and see judge for yourself.",positive
Beautiful Boy,"Based on the memoirs Beautiful Boy: A Father's Journey Through His Son's Addiction by David Sheff and Tweak: Growing Up on Methamphetamines by Nic Sheff, written for the screen by Luke Davies and Felix van Groeningen, and directed by van Groeningen in his English language debut, Beautiful Boy is a film about the horrors of addiction, told from the perspective of both an addict and his father. Focusing primarily on David's attempts to understand and fight against his son's addiction to crystal meth, the film aims for a no frills sans-sentimental authenticity (Davies is himself a former heroin addict, who based Candy: A Novel of Love and Addiction on his experiences). Serving as something of a showcase for the two lead actors, (Steve Carell and Timothée Chalamet, both of whom are exceptional), there's little in the way of plot, with the film instead adopting a non-linear cyclical structure designed to mirror the repetitive nature of addiction-rehab-relapse-addiction-rehab etc. And whilst it is certainly heartfelt and respectfully told, there's little in the way of emotional engagement.Living in Marin County, Nic Sheff (Chalamet) is an intelligent, popular, and kind teenager, who has a close relationship with his father, David (Carell), his stepmother Karen (Maura Tierney), and his two younger half-siblings, Jasper (Christian Convery) and Daisy (Oakley Bull). He is less close to his birthmother Vicki (Amy Ryan), who moved to LA after she and David divorced. David is a journalist for the New York Times, and Karen is a painter, with the family enjoying a comfortable bohemian middle-class existence. The film begins as David attends the offices of a drug counsellor and psychologist, Dr. Brown (Timothy Hutton). Explaining that Nic has become addicted to crystal meth, he wants to learn everything he can about the drug in order to best help his son.The most notable aspect of Beautiful Boy is the structure, which is both cyclical and non-linear - the film is made up of a series of high and lows following Nic and David through relapse and recovery, whilst at the same time, there are multiple flashbacks, with scenes in the present giving characters occasion to think about moments from the past. For example, as David sits in a diner waiting for Nic to arrive, he thinks back to a much happier meal he had with his son in that same diner many years previously. This technique is used throughout the film, often flashing back to happier memories of Nic's childhood. The problem with this is that it's overused; there's barely a scene that doesn't have some kind of temporal cutaway. This overuse also dulls the impact of such editing, as after 45 minutes, you're just yearning for the film to stay put for a while.As regards the repetitive nature of the story, I understand what van Groeningen was going for - it is supposed to mirror the back and forth nature of addiction (""relapse is part of rehab"" as David is told), a two steps forward, one step back staccato motion. However, the film falls into a pattern of Nic showing up looking a little more dishevelled than he did before, followed by David doing everything he can to help, followed by his failure to get through to Nic, followed by Nic disappearing, followed by Nic showing up looking a little more dishevelled than he did before, etc. And whilst this may lend itself to a certain authenticity, it doesn't make for very effective drama. In any case, other filmmakers have found ways to depict the repetitive nature of addiction without compromising the story, not the least of whom would be Darren Aronofsky in Requiem for a Dream (2000), who constantly uses a quick montage of the characters doing drugs to suggest the habitual nature of addiction.Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the movie is that Nic is a prosperous and intelligent middle-class young man with a strong support system. He is a child of divorce, yes, but he has a good relationship with both of his parents. This is a far cry from the typical addict we see in film and TV, who are usually at the extreme ends of the monetary spectrum, either poverty-stricken and destitute (such as, say, Bubbles (Andre Royo) in The Wire (2002)) or extremely wealthy and high-functioning (such as Caspar (Geoffrey Rush) in Candy (2006)). Nic first tried drugs to see what they were like, and when he liked how they made him feel, he kept on doing them. There was no precipitating event, no great emotional trauma which made him turn to narcotics; his addiction is just something that happened, a disease to which anyone could succumbA major theme is that of the father-son relationship, and this is well-presented. With both actors giving superb performances, one really sees the bond between the two, and how much Nic's addiction is destroying both of them. In this sense, the real tragedy of his situation isn't the rehabs and relapses, it's seeing him drift further and further away from a man who would literally die to protect him. Given the source material, one does wonder a little if the relationship is idealised somewhat, but irrespective of that, Carell and Chalamet give a masterclass in acting.With lesser performances, the film would have crumbled under the weight of van Groeningen's heavy-handed direction. Thankfully the performances are strong enough that the style distracts rather than undermines. That said, the benefit of the non-linear storytelling is that it allows Chalamet and Carell to really drive home how much their relationship changes, with their playful and happy earlier scenes contrasting heart-breakingly with the fraught and destructive times of later years. Chalamet's is the more physical of the two performances, conveying so much via his body language as he completely inhabits the character, alternating between playing Nic as a sweet, loving, almost immature teenager, and a stressed addict, old before his years, and capable of anything to get money for his next hit. When he is rehabbing, there's a regret and humility in his performance that is nowhere to be seen when he relapses, as he becomes more manic and unpredictable, and much less self-aware.Carell, for his part, does most of his best work with his eyes, conveying the sadness and desperation he feels. His helplessness is written across his face, conveying how little he can actually do for his son. He initially approaches the problem in a logical manner (he does methodical research on crystal meth to better understand it, he snorts cocaine to try to put himself in Nic's shoes), before eventually realising there is no logic at play here, and tackling the subject as he would an article for the New York Times is not going to work. Carell plays David as confused, haunted, and desperate, with Nic's addiction having as profound a psychological effect on David as it has a physical effect on Nic.Despite all of these positives, however, as indicated above, there are some significant problems. For one, van Groeningen chooses not to present some of the darker aspects of Nic's story. For example, he turned to prostitution at one point to fund his addiction. Additionally, as his hits from crystal meth continued to diminish over time, he started shooting it up, which is insanely dangerous. Leaving out aspects such as this gives the film a kind of sanitised feeling, as if we're looking at addiction through a gauze which the director refuses to pull back to let us see it directly. This kind of heart-breaking sordid detail would have helped the film immeasurably, especially in relation to its lack of emotional engagement.This lack is probably the most egregious problem. A film of this nature, detailing something like this, and based on a true story, should be an emotional rollercoaster, but the audience is always removed, the emotions are seen rather than experienced, as if we're looking at the rollercoaster instead of riding it. Because the film introduces us to the characters mid-crisis, and because there's literally not a single scene that isn't either related to Nic's addiction, or a flashback from a scene related to his addiction, we never really get to know David or Nic outside this situation. Any sense we have of them as people comes almost entirely from the acting, and even then, although you certainly feel empathy and sympathy for them, you don't feel a huge amount else.This dearth of characterisation is even more pronounced in relation to the two women, who may as well not be there. Karen has nothing to do but wander around in the background painting trees, whilst Vicki doesn't even get that much - she's a disembodied voice on the phone most of the time, and although I know she appeared in a couple of scenes, by the next day, I'd forgotten what she did in either of them. It's a real waste of two extremely talented performers.There have been some truly great films about addiction; The Man with the Golden Gun (1974), Days of Wine and Roses (1962), The Panic in Needle Park (1971), Drugstore Cowboy (1989), Trainspotting (1996), Leaving Las Vegas (1995), The Basketball Diaries (1995), Requiem for a Dream. Beautiful Boy is absolutely nowhere near anything of this calibre. In fact, it's probably more successful as a kind of instructional installation for relatives of people going through addiction than it is as a film evoking emotions. Told from the perspective of people living through this nightmare, the story is incredibly straightforward and forgettable, when it should be shocking, disturbing, and emotionally devastating. And whilst the film is definitely heartfelt, its lack of emotional engagement, its repetitiveness, its distracting structure, its lack of a plot, all serve to grate against the incredible performances.",negative
Beautiful Boy,"The best movie I have seen so far in 2018. It is heart-wrenching, compelling, emotionally raw, and authentic. The acting from Timothee Chalamet and Steve Carell is strong and Oscar-worthy. Timothee is proving to be one of the best actors of his generation. It is a no-frills movie that illustrates the struggles and cyclical nature of destructive addiction, relapse, and recovery. It is beautifully directed and poignantly adapted from two memoirs. It also displays the emotional dynamic and turmoil of the father-son bond wonderfully. The cinematography is also top notch and captures the tone of the film. I am honestly baffled by some of the critic reviews. Beautiful Boy deserves a much higher rating. The film is honest and I empathized with the issues because the film explores the pain in such a real way. We witness how the addiction affects the entire family and how average people can be sucked into the black hole that drugs offers. It is relevant in this day and age to show the problems that relatable youth face. In most Hollywood films, we typically see the addiction melodramatically explored with individuals suffering from a specific trauma or living in abject poverty. In this film, we see the torment & despair of addiction powerfully & realistically explored within a middle-class family. Beautiful Boy is a must-see for everyone. It deserves Oscar nominations for Timothee Chalamet, adapted screenplay, cinematography, and directing. The entire cast is exceptional and should receive a SAG ensemble nomination. The movie is so much better than a number of the other acclaimed, flashy Oscar contenders of 2018. Beautiful Boy is candid and naturalistic. Not only does the audience get access to such fine artful filmmaking but also gets served with life lessons. There are a number of tear-jerking scenes and the pathos of it all, hit the core of my soul.",positive
Mary Queen of Scots,"Mary Queen of Scots is an historically inaccurate modern activist film that fails in both casting and portraying accurately what transpired. Aside from Mary and Elizabeth having never actually met face to face the film includes things such as an Asian Countess, a black lord, and also includes too much attention regarding sex scenes and homosexuality. If you are interested in the true story this should be skipped at all costs; books and documentaries on the subject should be consumed instead. This film should have used fictional characters and locales in a fictional time.One day I hope someone has the cajones to make a film about Mary's son, James VI, who undid all the sacrifice and suffering of his fellow Scots, in their struggle for freedom, to ultimately bind Scotland to London via the United Kingdom.",negative
Mary Queen of Scots,"Historic authenticity is cast to the wind in this revisionist costume drama that feels like it was written by a freshman Women's Studies major. Directed by Josie Rourke with a screenplay by Beau Willimon, Mary Queen of Scots (2018) was based on the book Queen of Scots: The True Life of Mary Stuart by John Guy. Like many films released this year, it has strong female leads, a diverse cast, and progressive social messaging, but checking all the right boxes on the SJW playlist wasn't enough to save this film from mediocrity.The year is 1560, and the young and beautiful Mary Tudor (Saoirse Ronan) returns home, where she is out of place in a dreary Scottish castle. Her half-brother, James, Earl of Moray (James McArdle), has been ruling as regent, alongside a bevy of colorless and perpetually-angry Protestant men. Her appearance in Scotland alarms her cousin, Queen Elizabeth I of England (Margot Robbie). Elizabeth, a Protestant, is not seen as a legitimate ruler by her Catholic subjects. She seeks to gain influence over Mary by arranging a marriage with Elizabeth's own lover, Robert Dudley (Joe Alwyn).Instead, Mary marries the charming and charismatic Lord Henry Darnley (Jack Lowden), who pulls a Jeckyll-and-Hyde routine and becomes a drunken lecher on their wedding night. Things get complicated for the childless Queen Elizabeth when Mary becomes pregnant, producing an heir for her dynasty and strengthening her claim to the English throne. Can Mary fend off attacks from her domestic critics and convince Elizabeth to acknowledge her as England's rightful ruler?Mary Queen of Scots couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a film about the rivalry between two queens or a revisionist biopic of its titular character, so it does neither particularly well. This ill-conceived and poorly executed film also missed a chance to let its leading ladies shine. As Queen Elizabeth, the talented Margot Robbie goes to waste as a costumed mannequin who practically disappears for the middle third of the film.Historically, Mary Stuart was born in 1542, the only legitimate heir to Scottish King James V. She was briefly married to the King of France. After his untimely death in 1560, Mary returned to Scotland and ruled as Mary I of Scotland until 1567, when she was forced to abdicate after her second husband's murder (which her rivals accused her of orchestrating). She fled to England to seek protection from her cousin, Queen Elizabeth I, but many English Catholics considered Mary the legitimate Queen of England, so Elizabeth had her imprisoned and later executed.There are many anachronisms and inaccuracies throughout Mary Queen of Scots, not the least of which was ""colorblind casting"" that falsely portrays 16th-Century England and Scotland's aristocracy as racially diverse. Mary's Scottish accent was also out of place (she grew up in France), as was her friendship with Italian courtier David Rizzio/Riccio. Most historians acknowledge Mary was probably having an affair with the man, which infuriated her Second Husband. Rizzio might have been bisexual, but he wasn't ""one of the girls,"" as the film portrays.Though ostensibly based on a book, this film can be considered a remake of the 1971 film by the same name. Mary, Queen of Scots (1971) was directed by Charles Jarrott and starred Vanessa Redgrave and Glenda Jackson. Like the 2018 film, the 1971 version featured a fictional meeting between the two queens and speculated that Lord Darnley and the musician David Riccio were lovers. The two films part ways, however, when it came to Mary's imprisonment. The 1971 version devotes more screen time to her 19 years in English captivity, while this version fast-forwards through it.Mary Queen of Scots opened to mixed reviews and currently holds a 63% positive rating from critics and 44% audience favorability on RottenTomatoes. Its opening weekend took in a painful $194,777 on a $25 million budget. A successful film gets the audience invested in the story. Mary Queen of Scots ultimately failed to connect with audiences because it was more concerned with pushing the filmmaker's social perspective than making us care about who gains the English throne.",positive
BlacKkKlansman,"Every year I make a point of watching each of the Best Picture nominees for the Academy Awards before the ceremony airs. And every year I'm astonished at some of the films that are considered to be the ""best"" of the previous year. 'BlacKkKlansman' is a prime example of this. Is it a bad film? No. Is it a good film? Sure. But is it a great film and one of the eight best released in 2018? Not in this lifetime. Sadly I understand a lot of politics come into the Oscars and I think that is a large part of what is at play here. This is a heavily politically driven film that tugs at the heart-strings of just the right type of people that dominate Hollywood and the Academy. For that reason it gets a nomination. Not because it is a great film.Adam Driver has been nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards as well. This was also a baffling one to me. His performance is good and highly watchable, but he never blew me away by any stretch of the imagination. I kept waiting for him to be given one big scene he could really shine through and knock the audiences socks off with, but it never came. A really bizarre nomination from the Academy I would find it extremely surprising if he got the win for this reason.The film was actually very similar to the 2016 film 'Imperium' starring Daniel Radcliffe. Obviously it didn't have the twist of a black man being behind the infiltration, but a lot of the actual person to person undercover scenes were very similar in nature. I think I enjoyed that film more though because it was more interested in telling you a story, instead of ramming a view down your throat. I also thought the real-life footage shown at the end of 'BlacKkKlansman' was cheap and out of place. A very tacky decision by Spike Lee to throw that in there. I miss the days from the 90s when if a film was nominated for Best Picture you could be assured it was a truly brilliant film. This film doesn't even compare to those.",negative
BlacKkKlansman,"I didn't enjoy this film because it is too cartoonish for a « true story » about a serious matter. I honestly had to check if it wasn't a Disney production.
Ron is obviously a charming prince : handsome, friendly, educated, honest, clever, funny, wise and courageous. He has absolutely no weaknesses and handles his weapon (his phone) with magical dexterity. And of course his hair is perfect, like all princes.
Flip is the faithful and stubborn horse. He galops where he is told to go.
Patrice is a beautiful princess, wild, emotional and idealistic, who lives in the Black Panthers castle.
The bad guys are as naive and stupid as they are cruel. And at the end, the most wicked are dying of their own stupidity, the arrogants are humiliated, the vicious are arrested and everyone gives a standing ovation to the charming prince (even if the only thing he did was to have arrested a minor member of the Klan).
This is a feel-good movie that is very close to « Django Unchained » (or Inglorious Basterds) with the same simple concept : pick real bad guys, make fun of them and kill them. But Tarantino movies are a lot more entertaining, and certainly does not pretend to be « true ».",positive
Spotlight,"""Spotlight"" is an American movie from last year that runs for slightly over 2 hours and was written and directed by Tom McCarthy. It won two Academy Awards earlier this year, including the grand prize for Best Picture. And the reason for this is probably that it is about a really important subject, namely the way it was discovered by a major newspaper that pedophilia was something that existed on a larger scale in the Church, despite many attempts of the latter to keep it disclosed. Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams managed Oscar nominations for their supporting performances. I cannot say I agree with either sadly. McAdams played her part well, had a couple good moments, but I don't think it was one of the best of the year in her category. Probably more of a coattail nomination, I remember it was also pretty surprising she got in. Ruffalo's nomination was no surprise, he got in at all the precursors too. But I had sometimes problems with his performance. It seem over-the-top theatrical and it had a touch of one man against the Church at times, which went entirely against the idea of the team collaboratively managing great things. I am usually a fan of Ruffalo and he has good moments here too, but I think a mix of not so good writing and perhaps not the best approach to the role may have hurt the character. Keaton, Tucci, Slattery and Schreiber are pretty much the same, good but not great, but probably on par with the two nominees. It was a team effort and nobody really stood out. Seeing these names now I kinda think it helped McAdams with her nomination that she was the only female from the bunch.In terms of the entire film, I summarized it appropriately in the title I believe. It is a very important subject and it was a strong cast making this subject work with dignity and professionalism, but I personally felt the heart was missing. And this subject certainly would have deserved to make a more emotional impact in the grand scheme of things than it did on me. The attempts by McCarthy to deliver in terms of that were something that felt rather forced than effective to me. They brought in references to the journalists' private lives and how it impacted them to some extent, but it did not feel too compelling for me to watch these and the victims also did not add as much as I hoped they would. The ending with Keaton's ""Spotlight"" quote was nicely done though. I also liked the way they brought in 9/11 getting in the way of disclosing the events. Overall, I believe this is an important movie that is worth watching mostly because it all happened in reality and because with the Best Picture win, it is probably now the defining film on a very contemporary and tragic occurrence of events. But I still feel it did not make the impact that it could have made and my favorite McCarthy film to this day stays ""The Visitor"". But I recommend ""Spotlight"" too of course. I would say it's nowhere near the best or worst Best Picture Academy Award winners.",negative
Spotlight,"This movie undid something inside of me. It's that part of you that holds on to hope that people can be good, that there is hope for humanity. I knew the basics of it when I went to watch it: that it is about investigative reporters looking into a story of abuse in the catholic church. And it uncovered so much more than just that. Honestly, this movie should be seen by anyone who seeks the true face of the world. We don't live in a pink bubble of happiness. F*cked up things happen to people all the time; worst thing is when it happens to the innocent. The little ones who can't protect themselves. When they are robbed of their faith and their hope and their future. Sitting in the film theatre on the last row, I was brought to tears as in front of me a long list of places where victims spoke out was scrolling. I was both shocked and mad. I felt sorry that people can fail so miserably. ""Mike Rezendes: They knew and they let it happen! It could've been you, it could've been me, it could've been any of us."" Indeed. When we witness darkness and we shut up and we don't do anything about it, that's when we fail. A poet once wrote, ""You can join the millions talking in the dark. Or you can stand up and scream light, out into the night."" So choose to stand up. In your profession choose to eradicate the oblivion of evil. This movie is a masterpiece. From the dedication of the actors to their roles, to the script, the director and the cinematography. The score? Fantastic. Howard Shore did it again!",positive
Molly's Game,"I hesitated to be critical in the way I'm about to be because of a few factors that I ask readers to keep in mind. I'm 71 and wear hearing aids. At home on my TV, I almost always have captions on because of my hearing problem. Still, But then, I already had trouble following all the dialogue in the West Wing. In ""Molly's Game"" getting the flashbacks was a similar experience for me: too fast, not quite clear enough who was who, and the connections with the current scene sometimes not quite clear enough and it went by too quickly to think about it as did much of the dialogue. That I have hearing and processing problems hardly means I don't understand and/or can't follow most films I see at the theater. I loved ""The Post."" Nor did I have trouble with ""Molly's Game"" because I'm not smart: I have a M.A. in philosophy from U.C. Davis. This film just seemed like Sorkin trying to outdo Sorkin with the snappiness. and speed of dialogue and more.",negative
Molly's Game,"Molly's Game works as well as it does due to the sheer vitality of Jessica Chastain's performance. As an actor, she isn't the most overt emoter, and she doesn't need to be. She manages to draw an incredible amount of empathy out of her characters, always in control but willing to let the cracks in the armor show. She is one of the most remarkably restrained, yet emotionally potent, actors in Hollywood. She excels at taking these strong, resolute women through hell and back, coming out stronger and more complex while being very aware of the gender dynamics of her characters. Molly Bloom is by necessity steely and crafty, but she is also a human being in a world that oftentimes has no regard for humanity. As Bloom, Chastain is a scorching force of nature with a hell of a wardrobe. It's easy to praise her more dramatic moments later in the film, but watch her every move during her initial rise to power. You want to root for Molly as she begins to learn, as she faces disrespect from her boss, as she gains more and more confidence.Chastain and Elba give fiery performances that help the film retain some of its shine as it moves toward its conclusion. Shoutout to Camp, d'Arcy James, and Cera for their small but solid roles. The film overall is a bit too long and does inspire some fatigue, but the story is engaging enough and Chastain is an absolute star. There's nothing particularly remarkable about the way the film is constructed, but it manages to keep you reasonably entertained.",positive
Vice,This film will be debated for years to come and be remembered for bale knocking it out of the park again. Love or hate there is no denying was a bargain at the box office.,negative
Vice,"Such a disappointment! So looking forward to this release, but while Christian Bale does a great job, the rest of the movie is A MESS!! Totally disjointed editing and uninspired narration has produced a sophomoric production that disappoints on multiple levels. The timeline jumps all over the place and is punctuated by inane commentary and black and white captions that try to ""teach"" the audience - just in case the message didn't hit you in the face. I'm middle-of-the-road politically, but even I was embarrassed by the blatant attempt that the movie made to express its political opinion. Yes, he loves his wife and children, and otherwise is portrayed as having no other redeeming qualities, but certainly a biopic can go a little further than that in portraying what is clearly a complex and conflicted character. High school productions have more depth and sophistication than this shallow rendition of a biographical portrayal. SAD!!!",positive
12 Years a Slave,"Once again Hollywood waves its sanctimonious wand over history with this glossy movie about slavery in the United States. Like a self-righteous teetotaler telling off an alcoholic, it is a sentimental, holier-than-thou piece that challenges you to criticize it or 'you're a racist too'. Following in the footsteps of Django it uses the excuse of history and a worthy theme to justify gratuitous scenes of violence. The film begins in the home of the central character, Solomon Northop, a free black man, who lives a genteel life with his family in New York. The director is clearly eager to get to the gory bits though, and within the first ten minutes Solomon has been kidnapped, enslaved, and the audience is cringing under a close up of his contorted face during a twenty minute whipping scene; the first of many to come. The film continues in this vein, as we follow Solomon's journey through an array of increasingly evil slave-owners. There is a segregation of personality in the film, with most of the black characters being good and moral and the white ones evil. Surely it is as patronizing and insulting to assume personality is dependent on colour as it is politically correct. At least the same cannot be said of gender, the white women are as evil as their male counterparts. However no film about slavery is complete without our token good white guy, and Brad Pitts rises to the occasion, strolling in bearded and ready to play, once again, the hero.One does wonder why Solomon doesn't send a letter under his 'mistress'name on one of his frequent forays to the shop. (Of course, his one attempt to run away is thwarted when after two steps he stumbles on a lynching scene). Perhaps the point the director is trying to make is that Solomon is too broken and scared to do this. He is too proud, however, to pick the cotton quota demanded by the sadistic slave-owner. A necessary contradiction perhaps, as this allows more whipping scenes as he is punished daily.Or why, instead of trying and failing to write a letter with a blunt bamboo stick and watery juice, he doesn't simply use the candle end and stain the paper instead. But it is not a film for the details. Nor the historical overview.It is two hours of increasing brutality, culminating with a horrendous scene where one girl is whipped until her flesh is exposed. Instead of taking one of the many examples of modern day slavery however, which could leave people feeling guilty at inaction, it is set far enough in the past that it allows the audience to do their cinema time, and leave feeling as worthy and sanctimonious as the director.",negative
12 Years a Slave,"12 Years a Slave tells the true story of Solomon Northup, an educated and free black man living in New York during the 1840's who gets abducted, shipped to the south, and sold into slavery. It is a film that stimulates at both an emotional level and an intellectual one. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Solomon Northup. He's been a ""that guy"" actor for sometime – film-goers may know his face but not his name. After this film his name will be known. He gives, quite simply, the best performance from a leading actor since Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood. Because of his character's position as a slave he is usually unable to speak his mind unless he is prepared to be beaten. As a result Ejiofor is forced to utilize body language and his eyes, which become enormous pools of emotion to express himself to the audience. He's forced to endure terrible things, but he always maintains a certain dignity and nobility that makes his plight even more affecting. It's a performance of incredible subtlety that may leave you speechless and in complete awe.Micheal Fassbender gives the best performance of his already extremely impressive career, even besting his previous high marks from the films Shame and Hunger (both directed by Steve McQueen, who also directed 12 Years a Slave). He plays Edwynn Epps, a vicious and demonic slaver and perhaps the most loathsome and disgusting character ever put on screen. If alive today, he'd likely be a drunk with severe anger management issues. By turns pathetic and terrifying, he embodies the ultimate nightmare of a deeply flawed man given absolute power over other human beings, and through that absolute power finds only madness, which drives him to deeper cruelty. He's always a menacing and malignant presence even when not on screen, as his slaves must always be aware and prepared for his seemingly random bouts of sadism. Other actors give excellent performances as well. Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano, Benedict Cumberbatch, Sarah Paulson, Alfre Woodard are all great in relatively small roles. But in this film of titans it's the one you've probably never heard of who perhaps stands above them all. In her first role in a feature film, Lupita Nyong'o, playing the pretty young slave Patsey - the object of Edwynn Epps demented and horrifying affections and the emotional epicenter of the entire picture, gives one of the most devastating performances I have ever seen. A portrait of unbearable sadness, her character is a mirror image of Solomon. While Solomon is a man who refuses to break and give up the dignity which he's known since birth, she is one who has long since been broken, and who never knew dignity in the first place. Her life is a living hell, forced to endure the ""love"" of Edwyn Epps and the brutal jealousy of his wife, she's trapped in a terrible triangle that she can't escape. Despite that, she retains a level of innocence that only heightens the tragedy of her character. It actually gets to the point where simply looking at this character might be enough to bring you to tears. It's a shattering performance.Starting his career as a video artist before making full length films, Steve McQueen has an uncanny eye for imagery and contrast. He's also a very patient film maker, utilizing long, steady single shots to emphasize various things. In his prior films this has felt like a purely stylistic choice, here, it's a choice aimed directly at our heart. When the events on screen become their most horrifying and ugly is when his camera becomes the most unflinching. At times feeling perhaps like we're seeing out of the solemn eyes of the ghost of some murdered slave, watching in sorrow and rage. This is both McQueen's most accessible and artistically searing film yet. There are also moments of stunning natural beauty that would make Terrence Malick proud. Alone, these shots would inspire wonder, but in the context of this film they make us feel more forlorn, as if the ugliness of man is encroaching on the natural beauty of the world.Perhaps the most noteworthy thing about 12 Years a Slave is the way that it portrays slavery itself. Instead of taking the easy way out and limiting his exploration of the topic solely to the slaves, Steve McQueen increases the scope and we see how it affects those who profited by it. Take Benedict Cumberbatch's character. A seemingly decent and caring man who treats his slaves with some semblance of respect and kindness. He comes off as a relatively good man who is trapped within the powerful confines of the institution of slavery. In 12 Years a Slave, slavery is shown as a horrifying and destructive social construct that drains the humanity from everyone it touches, turning good men into moral quandaries, turning flawed men into monsters, and turning an entire race of people into livestock and tools. To watch 12 Years a Slave is to be confronted with the grim reality of slavery in a way that's never been done before. To say this is the best film ever made about slavery feels trivial, as slavery is a subject in film that has been shown with naive romanticism from films like Gone With the Wind or silly exploitation from something like Django Unchained. Both of which serve to make the topic digestible. To watch 12 Years a Slave is to experience a level of despair and misery that can become overwhelming. It's a film of such ugliness, such blunt emotional trauma, that it may haunt you for hours if not days after seeing it. So why should you watch a film that could leave you reeling and devastated? Because, it's also one of the greatest cinematic achievements of our time.",positive
Bohemian Rhapsody,"I am clearly in the minority, and do not understand the love for this movie. The story jumped around entirely too much. It didn't build up the relationships or people. What could have been an amazing biopic fell short. It scratched the surface and never went deep in the storyline.",negative
Bohemian Rhapsody,"This movie is a must see for any music and movie lover
Queen fan or no Queen fan,anyone who sees this movie will be going through a rollercoaster of Emotions
Beeing it Queens music or the story behind the music
Rami Malek puts down an excellent version of Freddie Mercury, but all the actors play great in this movie
In my opinion best thing to do is ignore the criticism and go see it for yourself.",positive
The Big Short,"I appreciate that The Big Short tries to dumb down the housing crisis of 2008, but, apparently, I'm still not smart enough to fully understand it. A lot of this movie went over my head, but I grasped the generalities and it kept me entertained, so I applaud it for that. This film also featured some great performances by the cast, who lose themselves in their respective roles. This movie is a downer, but it's an educational downer.",negative
The Big Short,"Great drama moves you. It excites you. Scares you. Makes you sing. Makes you cry.The Big Short makes you shake your fist. The Big Short is driven as much by its Iago as it is its Othello, and deservedly so.The events in the story did happen. Many people still don't care. The Big Short gives you reason to care. That is what separates this film from being merely a documentary and turns it into high drama. No matter your politics - mark this, like Citizen Kane, as a movie that should be seen at least once. It is not always comfortable to watch. And that is a good thing - The Big Short is a documentary of a real life horror that unfolds in slow motion, and reminds us that even after the fact - no one is listening. Because truth is like poetry.",positive
Richard Jewell,"I'm not a real fan of slow paced long movies... unless they are made by Mr. Eastwood. He captures every tense moment, facial expression, or still scene, and manages to fill in more about the story he is telling. Casting was perfection! Paul Walter Hauser needs awards for his performance. Kathy Bates and Olivia Wilde were on point, as was Sam Rockwell and Canadian wannabe Jon Hamm - who is awesome in his TV commercials lol! Directing was perfect, cinematography great, score in line, and the writing was good. Very enjoyable film and I recommend it. It's a well deserved 9/10 from me",negative
Richard Jewell,"What if someone decided you were guilty of a horrible crime? What if the news said you were guilty and your friends, neighbors and co-workers believed it? What if the police tried to bully you into a confession when you were completely innocent the whole time? This is the true story of Richard Jewell, an innocent man who was cancelled by the media long before cancel culture existed. Excellent acting by Paul Walter Hauser and Kathy Bates and of course directed masterfully by Clint Eastwood. If you're not frightened by this movie - you're not paying attention.",positive
A Futile and Stupid Gesture,"""A Futile and Stupid Gesture"" is a self-referential bio pic of Doug Kenny, one of the creators of the National Lampoon who went on to co-write Animal House and Caddyshack. While the first half of the film is amusing enough chronicling the creation of the National Lampoon and Doug Kenny's friendship and collaboration with co-creator Henry Beard, AFASTG ends up being the story of Doug Kenny's alcohol and cocaine addictions... and that's the biggest problem. It's a film about an addict and ADDICTS ARE BORING. No matter how talented, creative or brilliant they were before when they become addicts that all goes away and they all behave in the same predictable self-destructive way. Once you've seen a couple VH1's ""Behind the Music"" you've seen them all - and you've also seen this film. The other big problem is that Will Forte isn't a compelling or interesting enough actor to for us to care about what happens to his character. If anyone is interested in the history of ""The National Lampoon"" magazine and the myriad of talented people who went on to work in SNL and later the movies, I recommend the brilliant documentary ""Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead: The Story of the National Lampoon"" and give ""A Futile and Stupid Gesture"" a miss",negative
A Futile and Stupid Gesture,"David Wain tells a true story in a creative way, creating the kind of the film his subject would have written, although a little sadder. Every actor does a superb job, Will Forte hits the perfect melancholic note. Dom Gleeson as usual is excellent. This is a wonderful tribute to Doug.",positive
Papillon,"This movie already has an uphill battle ahead of it by proxy, being a remake of the 1973 classic, and that's where I'm sure most criticism this movie gets will stem from. So let me get this out of the way now: This review will NOT be a comparison to the 1973 original. This movie will be reviewed as its own work, and I will not compare it to the original unless its deviations raise a legitimate question.On its own, this is a perfectly watchable movie. Serviceable performances all around. Rami Malek in particular does a great job with what he's given, although that's to be expected from him. The issue here lies in the dialogue. The writing is okay at best, diving into outright cringe-worthy at the very worst. There were quite a few times where I found myself quietly snickering to myself because of just how forced and clichéd the dialogue felt.The action is decent. It never devolves into outright shaky cam, but most of the action is still shot from too close up and thus becomes hard to follow. It ends up looking like the studio was trying to hide the more grisly aspects of the action, which is never a good mentality to have while shooting an R-rated flick.On that note, the movie really cannot seem to make up its mind whether it wants to go all-in on the R-rating or scale things back, to the point where it seems like the movie's most explicit moments were added solely to avoid a lower rating. Prime example? Just three scenes in, we're treated to at least eight exposed breasts. Very next scene? PG-13 sex. A few scenes later, an extra gets disemboweled on camera in vivid detail. The movie never comes close to attempting this level of gore again until the final kills. The biggest issue with the movie, however, is the pacing. The movie is 133 minutes long, but it will quickly start to feel like a 3+ hour ride. Why is this? Well, because the second act is just too goddamn slow. The solitary confinement sequence is admittedly great... until you realize that it just keeps on going without any development being made.In contrast, other threads are resolved too fast, causing the runtime to feel rather unjustified. This is the one area where I feel the need to compare to the original, as there, the great deal of planning that went into Henri's escapes is shown in detail. Here, they just sort of... happen, and feel rather contrived. And in a film based on a true story, a lack of this type of detail is kind of the worst that can happen.Overall, it's a perfectly serviceable film, but with all of its issues with pacing, writing, and content, and the existence of the original which is miles better, I can't recommend it to anyone really looking for a good time.",negative
Papillon,"Dialogs are boring, direction is good but for an action movie, the whole thing is not subtle at all, much less interesting and captivating than the original.",positive
Hacksaw Ridge,"For well over a year now I have been waiting with baited breath to see this movie. I have been a fan of Desmond Doss from a child. Having the privilege of the movie being filmed in my neck of the woods, and even getting to watch some of the scenes being filmed and meeting Mel in the process (ever so briefly), escalated my enthusiasm. When you are that pumped and euphoric, you are usually deflated when the moment finally comes but not this time.Although there were a few aspects of the story that were not as accurate as I would have liked, I realize poetic licence is necessary in some ways to give the real essence of the story. And truth can be so much harder to believe then fiction sometimes. Mel managed to portray the man Doss so very well. Some people are worried this is a religious propaganda/anti-gun movie and I assure you that is not the message of it at all. However there is no getting past the truth of who he was and it is the reason the story is so powerful. He was a man with an unmovable moral compass and it doesn't matter if you don't point yours in the same direction, you can't help but respect him for his courage, bravery, and unwavering faith. The movie starts laying the background of the man that will be the hero of Hacksaw Ridge. It is both witty and endearing. Andrew Garfield nails the roll as the gentle scarecrow of a man. He is a bit gawky and yet charming. His accent is true to the real Desmond, awkward though it is at times. He really draws you into the character and shows you what a fighter he was, non-violent but a fighter just the same. It is well explained what personal experiences have lead him to his discussion to not touch a gun.Hugo Weaving masterfully plays Desmond's alcoholic dad, battling with his demons from WWI, and Rachel Griffiths plays his devoted Christian mother trying to hold them all together. Teresa Palmer plays Dorothy, a nurse that captures Desmond's heart. Sometimes cheesy, but then again in reality it would have been, and it is very amusing to watch. Teresa's Dorothy is a beautiful and charming addition to the movie.Vince Vaughn plays the roll of Drill Sergeant Howell. He adds humour with his name calling, and humiliation of the soldiers, but is a very genuine - just a guy trying to win a war and keep his men alive in the process - kind of guy. Luke Bracey is a fantastic addition to the cast as private Smitty, the more traditional war story soldier.True to his reputation Mel does not hold back with the battle scenes. The devastation is already extensive and the ground strewn with bits of bodies by the time the 77th arrives. The shattering reality of war is dizzying and full of impact, moving so quickly you can barely identify the characters in a whirlwind of panic, pain and death. But amidst the chaos, Desmond Doss's character is revealed to everyone and even his harshest critics realize how wrong they were about him. Watching the story change from having the battalion hate him so much that they try to have him imprisoned, to refusing to go on the battlefield without him, is so moving and inspiring it leaves ""It's A Wonderful Life"" in the carnage on the hill, getting eaten by maggots along with the dead soldiers Desmond sifts through looking for ""one more"" soul to save.",negative
Hacksaw Ridge,"Another WWII movie but instead of D-Day and the Battle of Dunkirk, it's the Battle of Okinawa in Japan. Which means, new branch of military and new settings. Usually I want war movies to focus on the historical accuracies and action rather than characters, but this movie changed my opinion. It tells the story of Desmond Doss and his life and how he joined the army, that was very interesting and well-acted. The beginning explained our main character and introduced all the others, who are also a good addition. BUT the rest of the movie is awesome. The battle scene is engaging, heart-wrenching, and epic. It is very gruesome, some may not like that, but that's how it actually happened - when you get hit with a bullet, there's going to be blood. The fight portrayed Desmond's goal and his heart to save others, which you have to respect. Not only does this movie provide adrenaline, but also a learning experience.",positive
Snowden,"Edward Snowden is one of the most fascinating Americans alive, so it's no wonder his life has been made into a movie. After the documentary Citizenfour, it's already the second film featuring the famous whistle-blower. Citizenfour focused on the days Snowden spent in a hotel room in Hong Kong, where he invited two journalists who published the news about the massive surveillance of millions of people. Oliver Stone's new film takes a different approach and shows us Snowden's back story. His life is shown in flash backs from the hotel room scenes. What made him decide to basically give up his comfortable life and spend the rest of his days in exile? Stone shows how Snowden slowly changed from a patriotic army soldier into a concerned citizen. When he and his girlfriend Lindsay discuss the war in Iraq, shortly after they have met, they disagree. He defends the war, and ridicules Lindsay's liberal views and her participation in anti-war protests. She tells him: 'America is founded on the right to question our government'. Years later, he uses those exact words to explain and defend his whistle-blowing.The relationship between Snowden and his girlfriend gets relatively much attention in the film. On the one hand because a love interest is always nice for a Hollywood film, but on the other hand also because it is important for the development of Snowden's mindset. His work for the NSA influences their relationship, not only because they have to live abroad, but also because it seems even Lindsay's e-mail and online conversations are being tracked and placed under surveillance. Is this the final straw that makes him decide to take bold actions? What bothered me about the film is that it is a bit too clean-cut. The intelligence agencies are full of giant screens and slick technology, there are some romantic scenes, and the film looks overall very smooth. It's a rather classic biopic, without much cinematographic added value. For a subject as controversial as the NSA-leaks, and a for a film maker with a reputation such as Stone, that's a little bit disappointing.",negative
Snowden,"Very well made movie, very well acted, and directed. Going in I was worried that the movie would turn into an action thriller or a love story that would cloud what really happened.I was pleasantly surprised to find a step by step account of real events with a deep look at what goes on behind the scenes at the various spy agencies.Personally I would have liked a little more time spent on the politicians (and other behind the scenes players) and how they acted before and after the Snowden revelations, but maybe that's a topic for another movieI would recommend this movie to anyone interested in modern history and geopolitics",positive
The Favourite,"I read the rave reviews before the film opened and really looked forward to it. I read them after the I'd seen the film and thought that I must have inadvertently gone into the wrong screening and watched a different film. The film I watched turned out to be an overblown (at least 30 minutes too long) stylised, pretentious piece of nonsense only saved by three great actresses at the absolute peak of their powers. The soundtrack was as irritating as it was superfluous and the foul language as gratuitous as it was unnecessary. I thought that maybe my response was because I didn't get it, being English and familiar with this type of film, but I saw the film in the US and the mood of the audience throughout and especially upon the ridiculous ending was almost unanimously negative - and volubly so. I realise that in terms of reviews I appear to be in a tiny, tiny minority but if I can save one person from wasting their money on this film my work will have been done.",negative
The Favourite,"I literately signed up with IMDB to share was an awful travesty this film is. First of all, it is not a comedy. It is two hours of ugliness. A few chuckles ensued in my full house audience in the first half hour, because they expected to come for a comedy, which gave way to nervous chuckles, and capped off with confused WTH expressions as the awful conclusion. There is no plot, a story, but no plot. One would think this hack of a director would have learned this in film school. I mean the rest of the film with its sophomoric over the top lens selections and transitions screamed ""look, I went to film school!"". And my god, the awful sound track ALONE had me thinking of heading to the door, with the ostensibly tension building staccato beat invoked not once but TWICE with no correlation to the scenes. Do yourself a HUGE favor, ignore the positive reviews, skip this one and go watch Dangerous Liaisons.",positive
Rocketman,"I am a huge Elton John fan starting from way back when I was a kid in the '70's, and although I knew not to expect a straight biopic from what I had already heard about the film, I certainly didn't expect this! From the first song straight through the rest of the film, all I was thinking is that what we were watching was the Broadway musical Elton has probably always wanted to do, and probably should have done instead of a film. Ironically, now there's talk of turning this into a musical, so why not have gone that route instead?I cannot even single out what was the worst thing about ""Rocketman"", but certainly the most irritating was the time frame of events/songs. My concern is that people of a younger generation who don't know much about Elton and see this film will think that certain things that occurred are fact, like that one of the songs he performed at the historic Troubadour show that helped catapult him to superstardom was ""Crocodile Rock"", when in reality, it hadn't even been written yet. Another concern was an example from a fan review I read on another website where a woman(who didn't seem like she was real familiar with Elton's life)said that after seeing ""Rocketman""(which she loved), she ""felt sorry"" for him. I really don't think that Elton John would want pity from his fans, but because there is so much emphasis on the unhappy events in his life, one who is not familiar with the man and his body of work would think he hardly had ANY good times in his life during that crazy superstar time, and he DID have a significant amount of fun, he has admitted in interviews over the last couple of decades.If this film was going to be a musical, it should have had at least a fair balance of good and bad times, and not so much a woe-is-me film. But even with a fair balance, the whole thing would have still probably been a hot mess with the way it was made. A straight biopic would have been SO much better. Somebody needs to make a REALLY good and detailed documentary(and it doesn't even have to be a film in theatres; it can be a multi-part series on a network like HBO or Showtime)on Elton John. If you really want to see something that more successfully captures the fascinating complexity that is Elton, I recommend watching ""Tantrums and Tiaras"" from 1997, the documentary that was directed by David Furnish(then-boyfriend, now husband). That will be far more interesting than ""Rocketman"" was, so save your money and skip ""Rocketman"", and I say this as somebody who's loved Elton John and his music for decades. Because I am a longtime fan, I really, really wanted to like, no, LOVE the film, but unfortunately, I just couldn't.",negative
Rocketman,"Taron Egerton's portrayal of Elton John is superb and only heightened by the producers allowing Taron to sing his own versions of many of Elton John's classic hits. It would be impossible to capture all aspects of Elton John's life in the 2 hours provided in this musical/biographical film, so instead the producer/writer/director concentrated on Elton's early childhood which helped shape his destiny when he first met his partner in song writing the great Bernie Taupin played by Jamie Bell.There were far too many other excellent performances from the supporting cast members to mention them all but I have to mention two in particular who were top notch. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Elton's irresponsible (wife cheating) mother, and Richard Madden who plays John Reid one of Elton's early but serious lovers remained Elton's manager for decades after their sexual relationship ended. Both of these actors added a lot to the films depth in the one area that focused on Elton's tormented soul and led him to binge drinking and pill popping which is the area this film reflected.I hope we don't have to wait for Elton John to pass away (God forbid) before some producer realizes that Elton John and Bernie Taupin whose lifestyles and personalities are so diametrically opposite that they deserve their life stories to be developed into a (minimum) ten (10) hour TV Mini-Series to cover a heck of a lot of both of these musical genius's personal lives as well as their successes with their musical portfolios.Rocketman is well worth seeing and rates a perfect 10 out of 10 in my version of Elton John's quasi autobiography book.",positive
A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,"I find myself a bit conflicted about my feelings on ""a beautiful day in the neighborhood"" without using the word , disingenuous. It seems to be advertising it self as the Mr. Roger's movie , having him on the poster , the title a reference to him , and almost all the ads Hank's performance. The truth is it's more about the effect Mr. Roger's had on people (and still does) then a straight biopic. In fact Mr. Roger's is on screen for maybe less then half its run time . But , to be honest, it's ok. It's a very unique and intriguing story and I really enjoyed watching it. It just leaves you wanting more of its greatest moments : the recreation of sets, the transitions between scenes and of course Tom Hanks amazing performance. He truly becomes Fred Roger's , right down to body ticks and glares . Every moment he's on screen joy came across my face and I was whisked back to my childhood .
Unfortunately, something just feels forced about the other half , emotion just doesn't connect the way it should and some scenes feel out of place and oddly humorous. One such scene , a trippy nightmare , sticks out like a sore thumb . Sometimes things feel forced in as Mr. Roger's greatest hits then actual moments from the main characters encounters and they're extremely noticeable and out of place . All of this just doesn't gel into a cohesive piece like it should. You will find , however, a great message that really makes you feel inspired. I guess that's more Mr. Roger's then I give it credit for.",negative
A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,"This may get a little personal, but I've been suffering from severe depression and have had a lot of issues dealing with anger, sadness and all for about five years now. For the past 8 years of my life, and earlier years of my childhood, I have loved Fred Rogers. He always told me and millions of children all over the world that he likes us just the way we are, and taught us the power of kindness, positive ways of thinking and dealing with our emotions, and while I'll always be a cynic by nature, I've always tried to take what he taught me and many others to heart. He was genuinely the kindest, most loving and compassionate human being to ever grace this Earth. But over the past year especially, I've stopped caring about my life with tragedy happening around me constantly, making me feel like my life was falling apart, as well as me having thoughts of suicide. I always put Mr Rogers on to give me some kind of motivation to keep going, but his messages that once resonated so deeply with me began to fade as I slipped further and further away from being ""fine"". I've gotten a lot better over the past few months though, not perfect but still, and when I heard that a movie starring Tom Hanks as Mr Rogers was being made I did all that I could to see it as fast as possible when it finally came out in the UK (which as of writing this, was yesterday).The second this film started, the moment Hanks appeared and the music came on, I just completely melted. I almost audibly broke down into tears, but not with sadness, with joy and relief. I knew I was in for something that would grip me. This film is amazing. It focuses on the psychological healing and betterment of the protagonist, Lloyd, as Mr Rogers taps into his childhood and his feelings, the same way he tapped into the feelings of children back when his show was still on the air and back when I watched it a decade ago, and we get a powerful, touching tribute to this man and the impact he had on so many lives. Lloyd himself was not only well acted, but for me anyway I saw a bit of myself in him. Things like his strained relations with family, his overwhelming and blinding cynicism and his anger management are all things I dealt with at some point and still deal with today. So when the film took this character and and put him on this emotional journey to betterment and healing, it resonated so deeply with me that I began to feel as if I was a kid again, watching Rogers as he taught me how to deal with my own anger and to prioritise kindness, and for many people who saw this film, I feel like they experienced the same thing I did. And that's why this movie is so good. It has the same impact and kind-heartedness as Rogers' original show, but turned into an emotional, thoughtful and touching feature-length film that acts as the perfect tribute to Fred's legacy and life. At the end of the day though, the film, while an amazing tribute to Fred, isn't entirely about him. It's about how he saved the life of Lloyd, became one of his closest friends, and helped him heal his psychological wounds. And the perfect way to put this film is this: It's a film that celebrates the messages, kindness and life of Mr Rogers, that acts as a way to show the impact that he had on so many lives, and despite him not being in the film as much as Lloyd, who is the main protagonist of the film, his impact is felt throughout its entire runtime and in every single scene.Other things as well, the blending of the old Mr Rogers sets with locations in the film was very creative and touching, the acting, especially from Hanks was incredible, the film was perfectly paced and while the score isn't anything to talk about, the parts that do use music are done very well and capture the feel of the scene. The editing might've been a little iffy at points, but that was mainly at the beginning of the film. Overall, it's probably my favourite movie of 2019, even if I did have to wait until 2020 to watch it. If you have not watched it yet, please do. It's absolutely phenomenal.",positive
Green Book,"Right off the bat I want to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.the cinematography was beautiful with such rich color pallets. The score was wonderful and set the tone very well. Lastly the acting was incredible. Viggo and Ali shined in their roles and did a great job at portraying their characters.That said, in my mind the movie was nothing special. It was all very predictable and had a very similar feel to many other civil rights movies in which a black man and a white man start off the movie with a reluctant relationship and slowly warm up to each other as they begin to appreciate their similarities and eachothers troubles and eventually defy all social norms and become good friends. I'm not saying that they shouldn't have become friends because you can't rewrite history and this movie was based on a true story. I just wish that story telling was a bit more ambitious and delved into some of the ideas deeper rather thank making a well made but otherwise mediocre civil rights movie.",negative
Green Book,"We loved Green Book along with the sold-out crowd who applauded loudly at the end. Based on true story of piano virtuoso, Don Shirley's road trip through the south during the 60's, the film pays tribute to his genius and courage as a black man who tries hard to soar above the ugliness of the times. The elegant trappings of his home and his success as a concert pianist leave him arrogantly cold and lonely, but his life begins to change when he hires Tony as his road trip driver. With a history as nightclub bouncer with Mafia connections in New York, Tony is the antithesis of Don's perfection and their evolving relationship on the road makes the movie soar above the ordinary and become magical. Viggo and Ali in the main roles are remarkable, and it's funny and endearing to watch them discard stereotypes and discover their mutual humanity. What we liked best is the
movie teaches without preaching, it all unfolds through a myriad of natural moments between two great actors and a strong supporting cast. Top all this off with a really good soundtrack, excellent direction and production values, and an audience that laughed out loud and vigorously applauded at the end...this one is a true 10!",positive
The King,"This is a pretty good movie, but I'm only here to nitpick one little thing that bothers me.The writers for The King could learn something from what the writers of The Last Kingdom got right -- timeless language. The dialog in The Last Kingdom is entirely believable because they are saying things that sound like what people in the 9th c. might say. But when a character in The King says that reforms are easier in a time of ""regime change,"" that is very jarring. It's very contemporary, 21st c. terminology. Why not just write ""when there's a new king?"" Period drama would be well served by editing for anachronistic language.",negative
The King,This was epic. The acting was amazing. Near perfect writing. The actor who played Henry (Timothee C) should be a big star. Great presence. Take the time to watch this. I'm glad I did. High quality stuff.,positive
Dark Waters,"I don't pretend this is the best film of 2019, but it is likely the most important - a real must-see for people of all political persuasions (and anybody seriously considering going to law school). And you'll see how the most dangerous lawyer is the one who switches sides from defending the polluters to protecting their victims.Dark Waters accurately portrays ""the swamp"" that so many politicians rant against, but few rarely do anything to mitigate. The failures of the EPA and Congress -- all due largely to the Republicans who for some reason feel that it's okay for industry to poison the American people as long as it's profitable -- are stunning. You will learn how DuPont has been willfully poisoning us with Teflon coatings which it knew were carcinogenic way back in the 1970s. You'll see how DuPont issued a death sentence to its own employees as well as the residents of Parkersburg, WV with the waste from its manufacturing plant.As an attorney, I can attest that this is the one film that really shows how demanding law can be - the seemingly never-ending, exhausting effort needed to bring DuPont to some semblence of justice. And you'll witness how at a law firm's partners meeting, the partners who haven't even read the briefs dump on the case out of their ignorance and arrogance. Fortunately, in this instance those fools did not prevail. Otherwise we'd all still be cooking on Teflon-coated pans which, when hot enough, produce the carcinogens that have caused countless cancers and deaths throughout the world.If this film doesn't get you angry and determined to vote out of office the politicians who are eviscerating environmental protections, nothing will. It was a chilling reminder the morning after we saw Dark Waters that the headlines reported that the Trump administration was seeking to relax restrictions on deadly ethylene oxides -- in response to lobbying by the same good folks that have been poisoning us for decades. They -- and Trump -- are the very swamp that Trump lied he would drain.",negative

Actors old made to look young and young-ish actor made to look old, De Niros dodgy contact lenses, also the way he beats up the greengrocer that was comical, looked like a 90 year old man dishing out a lame beating, notice his foot stamp with the opposite foot an nothing being under it hahahaa, Stephen Graham's accent dodgy. Years for this pffftttt.",negative
The Irishman,"The last 5 minutes of the movie explain everything. 2 things:1- The photo of his daughter and Jimmy. These 2 persons are these ones that he loves the most. It reminds him how he lost them both. Frank killed his best friend and he lost his daughter after she understood he did it.2- The door half open at 1 minute before the end. Jimmy used to let the door of his bedroom open because he trusted Frank. Frank broke the trust and as a result he could never talk to his daughter again. This door represent the trust, and show that trust must never be broken. Trust is even more important than love because without trust there can be no real love.Great movie, great actors, congratulations Mr Scorsese.",positive
The Greatest Showman,"Critics these days, pssshhhh. It's the public reviews that seem to get things spot on. This movie was upbeat, fast moving (which I love) and completely dazzling. The talent was top notch and the story line was appealing to all ages. Sure this is a clean family film, but it doesn't make it any less artsy or enjoyable than those with an adult rating. I looked up the actual history of P.T. Barnum, and this movie wasn't far off from the basic story of his life. Sure they added drama to the story, but I don't even care. It's not like this was a pivotal story in World History. He was an entertainer, and guess what, a movie in his name just got made that was completely entertaining. I'm sure he'd be pleased with the end result. I am not one to see movies twice, but I'm sure I will. My husband and I went to the late showing last night and I will likely go again this week with my daughters and their friends. Is there anything Hugh Jackman can't do? Clearly there is not!! I would see this on the big screen with the full sound effects, and I'd probably plan on seeing it in theaters twice if I were you.",negative
The Greatest Showman,"I have never written a movie review but I couldn't let this jewel of a movie be slammed by the cynical critics without saying how much I loved it. This was the perfect movie for our family on Christmas Day. Don't pay attention to the ""professional"" reviews; judge by the moviegoers who are praising the movie. It was moving, upbeat, and romantic. Can't say enough good things about it. Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, and Zendaya are all so talented. Go see it in the theater to really appreciate how magical this movie is.",positive
Ford v Ferrari,"... but are some things or careers or professions worth paying the ultimate price for?So often the case, then as now, the team makes the difference and the paymasters do their best to scupper it through folly and ignorance.",negative
Ford v Ferrari,"This is what cinema is supposed to be! Amazing chemistry and acting by both leads, seamless CGI and practical effects to enhance the film, a firecracker script, a true story, pulse pounding soundtrack, booming sound mix, and edited so well that 2.5 hours flies by! Completely and utterly engaging . So good in fact I saw it twice within 24 hours . Once in Imax and once in Dolby cinema .",positive
Hamilton,"I started watching this out of curiosity and to say I have seen it, being the cultural touchstone that it is. At first, I was a little detached, not liking the songs too much, and thinking I would probably just skip through to end in a minute. I couldn't stop watching and it really sucked me in. I have to say, I'm not sure I would have enjoyed it at all, live in the theater. I benefited greatly from the captions and the ability to put it on pause to consult Wikipedia from time to time. The lyrics were so clever and really told the story. I ended up very moved and almost cheering at the end. Of course, now that I am familiar with the story, I would love to see it live and would enjoy it immensely. But I would strongly recommend this for a first time viewing. I will definitely re-watch. And probably again and again.",negative
Hamilton,"I mean, i WAS pretty high, but still.It definitely lived up to my hype.",positive
The Wolf of Wall Street,"By far the Best Movie of the Year, Best Actor, Best Director! The whole supporting cast is excellent as well. This movie will not disappoint it was much better than I expected and the duration of the movie is not felt at all. It definitely did not feel like a 3 hour production. Scorsese put this movie together brilliantly! You are on your toes and engaged throughout from beginning to end. Leonardo DiCaprio is at his best! He will take you through the highs and lows of the movie with an Oscar Winning Performance. I read about Jordan Belfort and it appears that Scorsese and DiCaprio made this movie as accurate as possible which I really appreciate. I commend Scorsese and DiCaprio for keeping this epic picture as authentic as possible. After all this is Hollywood.",negative
The Wolf of Wall Street,"This film is every definition of the word ""impeccable."" Scorcese's fantastic storytelling ability mixed with phenomenal acting from DiCaprio, Hill and the rest of the cast makes for an awesome combination. The film is never boring and gives you a glimpse into the life of a man who had everything in the world only to have it taken away.",positive
Bombshell,The true story would have been compelling enough and able to send on it's own merit. Before the movie starts there is a disclaimer that the story is inspired by actual events and characters and events have been added for drama. Really? So knowing that they have basically made stuff up to enhance the drama you don't know what to believe. I think the women deserved better than to have their stories embellished.,negative
Bombshell,"Elegantly handling difficult concepts, Bombshell engages the audience as it takes them through a difficult journey through a medium generally considered ""boring"" or ""monotone.""",positive
