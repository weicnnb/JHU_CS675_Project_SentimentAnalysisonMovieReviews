MSG: The Messenger of God,"MSG: ------------------ If you're planning to boost your confidence, & trying to come out of depression then you must watch this movie --> MSG: Messenger Because after watching this there won't be any bad thing left to worry about in life(as this will be the worst of all of them).The 5% of the movie is about the Holyman: Sant Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh ji Insaan etc etc, his enemies & how they are trying to kill him in different ways.. rest of the movie is about what all the powers the baba has & what all the great stuffs he has done for the society. Some powers are mentioned as follows: >Generating electricity with a tip of index finger. >Converting firing bullets to flowers >Snatching Guns, melting in air, then making a crown out of it >Hypnotizing 500s of goons & making them followers instantly >Killing terrorists with playing mouth organ >Breaking an entire tree into pieces with a single punch >Punching 1 car and making fly 7 other cars >Producing water from drought land >Flying the bike, landing to the air balloon with a powerful bomb, making it blast, then jumping it back to the exact same position & many more... Some Actions baba is doing: >running blood donation camp >running free food for poor program >drug addicts rehabilitation centers >prostitutes rehabilitation centers >orphanage free homes >Clean India mission >Rock nights for youth & basically everything what Govt suppose to do...The movie is a long non-ending commercial of Dera Sachcha Sauda.. Where it is claimed that baba has total 5 crores of followers worldwide.Music: If you like the noise of running generator, then you'll definitely fall in love with all songs of this movie, which baba only has sang. The only difficulties is to understand the language in which all songs has been recorded, definitely not Hindi or English. The songs can start at any time, you can not even predict it. It comes liked unwanted mosquitoes who comes uninvited in your room, produce noise, bites you, then left you with their irritating marks all over.When you expect the great story has been ended, it start all over again with a new 'thrilling' baba's adventure. One thing is for sure, whatever you dress in life, whats so ever designer dress you buy for yourself, you can never ever ever ever ever beat the baba's style & fashion senses... he is just too good for any Earth resident.Overall its a movie you must watch before die, to set it as a benchmark for the hardest thing you've ever done in your life.So Go watch now.. before its too late.... because PART2 is coming soon.... [**i am going on a mental break for few weeks now***]",negative
MSG: The Messenger of God,"MSG-The Messenger emerged as a social reforming movie in the film industry. The movie has raised various issues of improving the society by tree plantation, cleanliness campaign and ban on drug. The movie is explanatory that how drug mafia targets a country. Each and every song of the movie is dedicated to love with God. The song 'desh k liye 'is fully energetic. The acting of Suspense and other action scenes is beautifully played by all the actors.the last dialogue of the movie leaves its great impact on the viewer and give the true message about humanity and human beings. The direction of all the real happenings in the form of story is beautifully shown. Thus the movie is not as one has thought like pravachans but all the humanitarian service activities are beautifully pearled in the garland of MSG",positive
Recep Ivedik 4,"Recep Ivedik is an example of cinematic parasitism. It is a product created solely to profit from as many people as possible by providing as little content as possible.Outliving the sympathy generated by its humble beginnings, the series has become stale, endlessly recycling the same subject matter of a (once) lovable crude protagonist against the elite intelligentsia of the country. A mixture of slapstick and juvenile scat humor, it accomplishes nothing in the realm of comedy.A crude, cheaply filmed waste of time which is a shame considering the brave and creative strides Turkish filmmaking has taken in recent years.Technically embarrassing, this is one of those rare films which actually take an entire cinema industry backwards in progress. 2/10",negative
Recep Ivedik 4,It's not a waste of time. I recommend you to watch this movie. This is not the best of Recep Ivedik series but good movie.,positive
Dügün Dernek,"One of the worst movies I have ever have seen. Deserved a zero rating but minimum was 1 so i gave it a 1, but in all honestly even a 1 rating is to much for this movie!",negative
Dügün Dernek,"The actors of this film are really funny.I really like Ahmet Kural and Murat Cemcir. But this film is like Recep İvedik. In their TV series , ""İşler Güçler"" the jokes are so funny. But In this film they are swearing too much. This film is OK. But isn't the best. I like the character ""Tüpçü Fikret"". He is swearing too , but his jokes are very funny. For example , If you want to see this film with your family , I don't recommend this , never do that. The wedding scene is very funny. I laughed , laughed loudly in this film. But the only problem , this film is like Recep İvedik. I think everybody should see it. But don't forget! Never watch this film with your family :)",positive
Celal and Ceren,"Well I don't know how to state this without sounding like a pessimist, but it was clearly the worst $10 I have ever spent. I had high expectations for this movie, the name suggests that it has a completely different setting than the actor/producer's previous movies (Recep Ivedik series), which were a complete disaster in my opinion, but unfortunately it was complete rubbish and I had to leave after 80 minutes. If you are fine with paying for a movie in which the most important element is people farting, then by all means, go ahead and watch it. If you are looking for your money's worth, buy some grass and watch it grow. It's way more fun and enjoyable than this movie. If you are really curious about why this movie got so many bad reviews, just wait until it's being sold in the $0.99 bin at your local grocery store. If you do, make sure to have a neurological check later on because it could really mess you up.",negative

Recep Ivedik 5,"shame of the Turkish cinema. i can not understand how this film could be the most watched movie of all time in turkey. ""If you want to get an idea for a country, look at the most watched film in that country."" Sahan Gokbakar has nothing to criticize. Its simple what he does, some swear words and sexual jokes, people laughs and the man makes money... It is not the person who made this film, the people who made this film the most watched movie must be criticized.",negative

Redirected,"This was one of the worst high rated movies I've ever seen. Made me so mad, I gave it rating 1, just because it was so overrated. I mean 8,7 from 12.000 users? Have you actually seen the movie before you rated it? I read somewhere this is the first Lithuanian movie to be accepted internationally. Well, if it means this is the first Lithuanian movie I've ever seen, then it's probably right. It's a Guy Ritchie meets Emir Kusturica. The acting is very thin, though. It's full of Eastern Europe clichés, but it's so overt, it's not even funny. I knew what to expect in each of the following dialogues 10 minutes into the movie. I fast forwarded through certain parts.In conclusion, if you want to see a bad ass, fast-cut, violent Brit movie, go see the Snatch. If you want to see an Eastern European movie, see the Underground. If you want to see a mix of the two, and a bad one if I might add, see this.",negative
Redirected,"I never thought that a movie with such a small budget could ever be made so well. And it's not some haunting house horror, but a full caliber of action, movie. I will not say, that it reached an A level quality, but comparing this one with other E. Velyvis previous works, ""Redirected"" is almost brilliant. The script on my opinion had few significant mistakes, but it did not stop me from enjoying the movie. Frankly, I couldn't stop crying while watching it, how funny that was from me. Though ""Redirected"" is orientated to the wider audience, I have to admit that there are some amazingly funny moments that will be understood only by a true Lithuanian (the scene with the emergency was crazy, but what is more crazy that it was actually based on a true story; or the old man in the forest making illegal hooch, witch is extremely popular in the country, I myself as a kid used to steal billets from there). The other east Europeans should also find something familiar.. :} but must not forget director uses lots of dark comedy. But overall I am pretty sure the West world will also enjoy the movie very much. They too will be able to recognize them self and how they look in the eyes of east ;] You know what, I can't wait to see it again.",positive
Iftarlik Gazoz,"As you can read in other reviews and critics about the movie, it is not one of the typical Cem Yilmaz movies which are usually full of humor and sarcasm. The atmosphere and the characters, especially who speak the local accent, have made the film more realistic and hearty.The story is well written in the sense of unity and continuity. It holds the attention and curiosity of the audience on the story. But the plot is spread with the themes which are apart from each other. At first you feel like it is a movie showing the cruel times of Turkey in 1980s when the military took control of the country with a putsch and killed, tortured and imprisoned many people. But then you are confused because of the religious teachings and advice are being given by different characters in the whole movie.For example; the conservation between the ant and Adem about pilgrimage in his daydream. And the revolutionary conversations and sayings of Hasan make you think that it is a movie about the revolution or anti-capitalism. You can't get the gist of the movie because of these different and irrelevant themes mixed together. If you watch the movie from this perspective you catch lots of scenes like that. My interpretation about those superfluous religious scenes is that it is an effort to adapt the movie to conservative atmosphere of Turkey, which means not to disturb the community which is in charge with a conservative vision and also to expand the variety of audience. Except for the issues mentioned above, it is an enjoyable and at the same time heart burning movie.",negative
Iftarlik Gazoz,"I was born in 1993. I did not live in 70's-80's but i heard, read and watched so many stories about it. I'm not from Aegean Region. I was born and living in Ankara in Central Anatolia Region. These two regions have different types of people and day life. But this movie brought me my childhood. Made me smile. Ending scenes of movie made me almost cry. Maybe people who out of Turkey, cannot understand but we will. We'll cry for who are our lost before. Good project, good acting, good script, good directing. This movie deserves 10 out of 10.",positive

Go Goa Gone,"Go Goa Gone is truly one of the most hilarious Hindi films since Delhi Belly. It's a zombie comedy, with lots of blood and gore, so it's in no way for the squeamish, and the humor is quite mature, so it's NOT a child-friendly watch, but, hey, it's the subject matter itself which isn't really kid-suitable.Nevertheless, Go Goa Gone sets out to bring a new genre into Indian cinema with great gusto, and it fails to fail. With rib-tickling lines, great comic acting by Kunal Khemu, Vir Das, Anand Tiwari, and even Saif Ali Khan as the quirky, macho Boris (soon to be one of the greatest cult characters of all of Hindi cinema), Go Goa Gone FORCES you to laugh effortlessly.Yes, the plot gets a little dragging at the second half, and Puja Gupta's acting isn't very novel (although she looks great), but mostly, Go Goa Gone just always makes you laugh at one point or the other. I was chuckling at every other moment. The zombies are well-made, for a first in Bollywood, and nothing looks cheap. The action is pretty nice, and the songs are quirky and trippy.I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to have a good laugh-fest. Except the kids, of course...",negative
Go Goa Gone,"It's a rarity for Indian movies to step beyond the conventional(and convenient) love stories and venture into the unknown.'Go Goa Gone' tries that and does a commendable job.You have heard of romcoms,now there is a new genre and it's called 'ZomCom!'.The movie stars Saif Ali Khan,Kunal Khemu,Vir Das and many many zombies.There is good chemistry between the friendly trio of Luv,Hardik and Bunny.There's lot of slapstick humor,plenty of boisterous moments.The trio attend a rave party in Goa where all goes wrong.Thanks to a drug,suddenly zombies are spawning out of the blue and they are hungry for any human they can find.The trio find themselves stranded on an island with zombies all around and no way out.Enter Saif Ali Khan as a Russian mafia Boris.Off late Saif's acting has really transcended to a new level of confidence and this role is an example of that.His character is just so amazing.His dialog delivery with that Russian accent,his intimidating yet adorable looks,his intriguing persona-are all things you will love about him.You get a kick within when he says with that Russian accent- 'I kill dead people'.The rest of the cast has acted pretty good as well and i liked Kunal Khemu's(Hardik) performance.There are plenty of genuinely funny moments.Don't try applying your mind too much or connecting the dots,this one is just meant for fun.Watch it and enjoy!",positive

Ali Baba ve 7 Cüceler,"Before I start of how i think about the picture, I would like to emphasize that I am a big fan of Mr. Yilmaz's stand-up comedies as many millions of people in Turkey. However if one must talk about the movies Yilmaz personally wrote and directed, then we come up with a conclusion that he is not as successful as he is as a comedian on the stage. The term of being successful is also too generous for someone to mention that kind of works. What are the requirements for a work to be called as a movie? That must be the first question for a person whose claim is to write the screenplay and direct a picture. And these requirements are not that simply to obtain as we can already observe form Cem Yilmaz's works. He has a great potential but have not gone many step forward since he started filming career. In every work he plays, his character acts identical with the character from the previous work. It is much the same person although their names differ from each other. The main and the biggest problem lies on the screenplay and directing. That are point where Mr. Yilmaz should be criticized. When we watch him as an actor in movies which he only acts and got no effects on directing and screenplay he is much more better. What he should be doing for his next work and what he is gonna make will be so different i am one hundred percent sure of that. Because he is not such kind of a person who evaluates the commentaries in a positive way.",negative
Ali Baba ve 7 Cüceler,"I didn't have the opportunity to watch the movie yet. But who cares, it is a Cem Yilmaz movie so it doesn't have any other chance than being a great work. I'll come and edit/rewrite my comment here after watching the movie. And if you ask why i am writing this, the answer is that i want to show you guys, to rate and review a movie you don't have to watch it. Knowing about the previous works of the writer/producer/starring actor would give you enough information about a movie. Here it takes us to the question what is watching a movie is? Is it seeing the every little detail in the movie and watching each frames the movie has? I watched the poster for 114 minutes and i consider myself as i watched it. Yes maybe I'm giving an extreme example but that is only because i want to take your time and stop you and make you think on the definition of ""watching a movie"". What makes a movie, a movie is everything about that movie. From the poster to the advertisement, every material and literature about that movie. So here i am reviewing it according to all other things except from the movie itself.Note:For those who are going to read this review and decide to post it or not, do not be deal breakers and let people read this review and smile.

Fack ju Göhte 2,"The fact that this movie was big here in Germany explains perfectly why there are so few good ones coming from here. I love silly humor, but this movie's humor is so low-level, wow... the story is not only foreseeable (which you'd expect from a movie like that), it's also completely bananas, full of stereotypes and flat as hell. The characters are hardly describable as one-dimensional, because I don't know if you can call one single character treat per part a dimension. Don't watch it, you're gonna be very unsatisfied.",negative
Fack ju Göhte 2,"Somebody please give director Bora Dagtekin carte blanche to shoot in Thailand! This is already the second time that he has taken a successful franchise out of Germany to an exotic paradise island in the sun. This worked very well with ""Türkisch für Anfänger"". In Fack ju Göhte 2 it's more a chance for the cast and crew to work on their tans than anything. In order to give the expensive location at least some justification, there is a bizarre subplot of orphans of the 2004 tsunami catastrophe who are destitute, have access to jetskis and are lead by an Austrian waif. Zeki, the coolest teacher ever since Robin Williams climbed onto a table, induces them to dive for diamonds with free McDonald's vouchers, and yes, there is a general abundance of inane script writing as well as product placement. Luckily, there is also an abundance of witty exchanges between Zeki and his chav wards. I didn't care about the location, and, although I didn't expect Doctor Shivago, I would have liked to see a better, more grounded plot. The running time of almost two hours is excessive and the story runs paper thin at times. But I have to admit that I had myself a laugh.PS: I just watched it for a second time. Basically, a fun movie until the gang of Tsunami orphans comes into play. Also, a lot of the scenes are copy-pasted from Hangover II.",positive

Organize Isler: Sazan Sarmali,"This movie is 10/10 because it had a brightening and optimistic comedy side to it. Since we were getting used to all the ""cheesy"" and ""bad quality"" sarcasms for so long in the Turkish film industry.. I have not been into a quality comedy movie in so long, I had to leave the theatre one time. Looking at it from this perspective; the movie was very very good. The script was well-written, each character was distinctive and the visuals were great. It showed a different side of Istanbul. The first movie was filmed in 2005 which sounds surprising, however, the movie was still original. The jokes were original and the movie synthesized other issues aswell, such as dad-daughter relationships which made us laugh but think at the same time. Kivanc Tatlitug was very successful with his acting. Well-done, Yilmaz Erdogan, you did not let us down once again! This is the quality we have been missing for so long.",positive
Truman,"Winner of five Goya Awards (the Spanish equivalent of the Oscars), this bittersweet comedy/drama about two men and a dog screened during the recent Spanish Film Festival earlier in the year. It was one of the more popular films in the festival and now it gets a cinema release. This amusing and deeply affecting film deals with universal themes of friendship, mortality, coming to terms with death, and it is sure to appeal to audiences. Julian (played by Argentinian actor Ricardo Darin, from Wild Tales, etc) is an Argentinian actor who has relocated to Madrid where he performs regularly on stage and television. He has been diagnosed with cancer, and after undergoing chemotherapy for a year he has decided to stop the treatment. He is resigned to his fate and sets about setting his affairs in order. Most importantly though he is trying to find someone to care for his beloved pet bull mastiff Truman, and has approached neighbours and strangers. His childhood friend Tomas (played by Spanish actor Javier Camera, from Living Is Easy With Eyes Closed, etc) relocated to Montreal but arrives in Madrid for a surprise visit. he hopes to change Julian's mind and convince him to go back to treatment. Tomas is sensible and restrained whereas Julian is more volatile and emotional in nature. Over the course of the next four days the two men reconnect as they wander the streets of Madrid, talking about their lives, loves, regrets and the future. There is also a side trip to Amsterdam where Julian briefly visits his son, whom he hasn't told about his decision. Truman is largely a two hander as it follows the two friends, although there are a few secondary characters with whom they briefly interact, including Julian's concerned and embittered sister Paula (Dolores Fonzi). The film has been directed by Cesc Gay (A Gun In Each Hand, etc), who handles the material in understated and sympathetic fashion. A droll vein of humour permeates the material. Gay, who co-scripted the film with Tomas Aragay, avoids becoming too sentimental, although the ending is effectively moving. The pacing is leisurely and gives audiences plenty of time to identify with Julian and Tomas. Camera and Darin are two of the most popular stars in their respective countries and they develop an easy going rapport here that seems natural. Gay's warm, honest and humorous script gives the two actors plenty to sink their teeth into and they reveal different layers to their characters. Darin is reunited with Gay, who directed him in A Gun In Each Hand, and he delivers a soulful and subtle performance here. Camera's low key and sympathetic performance here as the stoic Tomas offers a nice contrast. And the dog who plays the titular Truman is also superb; with its sad eyes and hangdog expression it has a warm and humorous presence. Gay and his cinematographer Andreu Rebes (A Gun In Each Hand, etc) make the most of the scenic Madrid locations, which add to the film's winning flavour. Truman is a winning, low key and moving variation on the familiar buddy comedy sub genre.",negative

The Bride of Humpty Sharma,"Humpty Sharma ki Dulhania, Shashank Khaitan's film, is an attempt to relive the magic of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, but definitely in its own way. DDLJ was one of the major blockbusters that Bollywood industry has seen and it gave a new attitude to the youngsters. Humpty Sharma ki Dulhania may not be the DDLJ of this decade, but yes, it is a movie in a true filmi style and it would bring smile to your face for sure. It does not ride high as far as logic is concerned. The movie definitely has some warm and emotional moments. The story is definitely predictable - girl meets the boy, both fall in love in spite of girl's engaged status, and then the pursuit for marriage by taking efforts to get the approval of family. The movie sticks to its core purpose – entertainment in filmy style, romance, comedy  This movie is for that segment of audience who just wants to watch movie for sheer entertainment and can't tolerate rona-dhona.Attitudes of the lead protagonists Rakesh 'Humpty' Sharma and Kavya Pratap Singh (Alia Bhatt) are shown initially itself in almost parallel frames, one being a carefree 'cool' Delhi guy, who flirts, always ready with witty one-liners and the later one a feisty Ambala girl. Humpty has friends Shonty (Gaurav Pandey) and Poplu (Sahil Vaid) who are always there for him. Humpty is shown to share great friendly relationship with his father (Kenny Desai). Humpty is a hard-core DDLJ movie fan, who still weeps towards the end of the movie. Kavya wears her attitude through the tattoo 'Pataka' on back side of her neck. According to her - ""Main to paida hi hot hui thi"". She is part of a rich family who is engaged to a NRI. She negotiates with her father Pratap Singh (Ashutosh Rana) to get her designer Lahanga worth 5 Lakhs. The logic is she did not get a chance to choose the guy, so at least she should get the right to choose her lehanga. Also, her friend Gurpreet of Delhi has bought a Lehanga of 2.5 Lakhs, so she should go for a lehanga of at least double the price. Kavya makes all these scenes very very enjoyable with her innocence. When Pratap Singh sweetly says no to her lehanga demand, she informs the family that she is going to Delhi (her uncle stays there), would earn and buy herself designer Lehanga and return after attending her friend Gurpreet's (Guncha Narula) marriage. Kavya meets Humpty in Delhi in a hilarious situation. Let me not reveal the same. Humpty and Kavya hit off instantly. They do fight, enjoy parties, competes over guzzling beer. Banter between the two is fun, natural, lovable. Both move ahead without any serious ties. They collectively help Gurpreet get out of a messy situation. And then the moment comes, when Kavya has to come back to Ambala. Shashank Khaitan has not redone Raj-Simran here, when Humpty and Kavya bump into bed soon after they feel for each other. Both of them try to move on lives in their respective cities without each other, but unable to do so. Humpty comes to Ambala along with Shonty and Paplu. Yes, a series of physical assault happens once family learns of Humpty's love for Kavya, but the tone of the violence is mellowed down. Humpty manages to get some time from Pratap Singh to prove him that he is the right choice for Kavya, better than the NRI Angad Bedi (Sidharth Shukla). Humpty's challenges increase when Angad does the entry into the scene as Mr. Perfect.How is Angad as a guy? We know that Humpty and Kavya would unite at the end, but how? The treatment to the plot is done in a very light-hearted manner. How does Pratap Singh yield? How does Humpty win Kavya's family's hearts?Cast is just superb. Ashutosh Rana as Kavya's father is very good. What a wonderful actor he is. He pours his intensity as well as sense of humour into the character. Varun Dhawan has done complete justice to his character. Alia is also wonderful. Her face has the right combination of innocence, chirpiness, traditional, bindass attitude. She makes Kavya so much lovable. Sidharth as Angad Bedi has great screen presence. I just wish, Sidharth's role could have been a bit longer and his vanishing from the last frames could have been given different treatment. Both Sahil Vaid and Gaurav Pandey as Humpty's friends and Kenny Desai as Humpty's father are all adorable, excellent performances from them. Rest of the cast are also good. Music could have been better. The song 'Samjhawan' composed by Toshi- Sharib and sung by Shreya-Arijit is very good.",negative
The Bride of Humpty Sharma,I just created an account now in IMDb just to write a review about this crap that I watched few hours ago. I cannot believe people are rating up to 3 stars out of 5 and 6.1 rating!!! I just wish there was zero or negative in the vote!If you are a big DDLJ-SRK fan please stay away! I think these people have lost their mind and they think people who watch movies are stupid and mean enough to like an awful story like this. Have this director ever watched DDLJ??? I personally feel that this is perfectly crafted to mock and insult the lovely performance of SRK and Kajol in DDLJ!!! Boy I wish they would never watch this pathetic movie. I have no idea why Karan Johar would agree upon something like this. The way modern Indian culture depicted in this movie is so condemnable. Please don't watch this movie guys or you will want to slap the director and the actors for choosing this script. 'Normal Human beings' will definitely hate this movie. May be they should try showing this movie to Zombies so that they could eat these peoples brains and just kill them right away!,positive
Hasee Toh Phasee,Though i get what style this film was going for but the director lost sight of the theme. Though I get the rules he was trying to break...he wasn't consistently breaking them. Also the whole manic pixie dream character was so irritating and poorly directed. She had no real depth to her character and every time she bit her lip to display her quirkyness or whatever I straight up wanted to punch her in the face. I can't believe how annoying her character was and straight up not believable but a caricature. This seems like a big budget film so frikin do better.,negative
Hasee Toh Phasee,"Before I get on with the review, let me tell you I'm not a hardcore Parineeti fan. Just like I'm not Kareena's fan even though Jab We Met is in my top 5 list. I went in to watch Hasee to Phasee casually without any expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised. I found the movie to be superb! From a critics point of view, this movie has nothing new to offer. In fact, you can complain about many things. But this is one movie, where I beg to differ with the critics. Even though I have seen such movies plenty of times, I couldn't help myself from loving Parineeti's character. And needless to say, nobody but Parineeti could have brought the character to life.Aggressive, Submissive and Whacky! Parineeti's character Meeta has so many shades, you couldn't tell what she'd do next. The only thing I didn't like was : hero falling head over heals for a girl he met just a week back. Maybe they could have given more time for their relation to mature. But that doesn't stop me from LOVING each and every bit of the movie. Like the sequence where the heroine casually asks her sister's fiancé to marry her. Or, the ""locked in the room"" sequence where Parineeti gives an excellent performance.I couldn't give much credit to Adah Sharma for acting. Having said that, she is also extremely gorgeous. I'd definitely like to see her in more movies. Chemistry between the lead actors is quite sparkling, and I was quite satisfied with how the things turned out.I'll be heading to the theater soon to watch this movie again. This movie is definitely going to be in my Top 10 list.",positive
Jolly LLB,"'Jolly LLB' Directed by Subhash Kapoor, is An Honest & Well-Intensioned Film! It has a worthy, inspiring story to tell & bravura performances working to its advantage. This Is Good Cinema!'Jolly LLB' Synopsis: A small-time advocate goes head-to-head with a high-profile advocate, when the former re-opens a controversial case. 'Jolly LLB' works because the Screenplay is strong & progressive. The narrative is funny, inspiring & honest. The final act, stands out. Its wonderfully penned & executed. Subhash Kapoor has directed the film with utmost honesty & sincerity. He handles the comedic as well the dramatic portions like a pro. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is sharp. Music by Krsna is good.Performance-Wise: Arshad Warsi is competent. A consistently great actor like Boman Irani is flawless, yet again. Saurabh Shukla is on a roll. After his stupendous performance in 'Barfi', Shukla emerges a scene-stealer in 'Jolly LLB'. His portions are marvelous & his performance is among the reasons why those portions work. Amrita Rao is fine. Mohan Kapoor & Harsh Chhaya are efficient. Sanjay Mishra, Brijendra Kala & Mohan Agashe shine in cameos. On the whole, 'Jolly LLB' is a worthy watch.",negative
Jolly LLB,"I saw this in theatre first day last show. I really liked Jolly LLB n I found it very entertaining and absorbing. In its satiric way, the movie is full of rich characters and plausible situations even if sometimes you can spot the cliché around the corner. Sometimes satire works as a magnifying glass to expose and better criticize something. Arshad unquestionably steals the movie with another over-the-top performance as the lawyer willing to risk everything. Superb performances by all. Special mention has to go to Boman n Saurabh Shukla. If u like court/lawyer movie, give this one a chance. This movie is an expose of the corruption, politics, and general crookedness of the legal profession. The movie does a good job of portraying both the human and systemic flaws of the legal system. Moreover, the movie balances between comedy n drama. Was highly anticipating a sequel. But lost all the zest once I read that Arshad is not part of the sequel. That is y I felt the need to write a review of this good movie even if it's very late. The only drawback was the romance angle n songs. But nonetheless, an awesome film.",positive
Pek Yakinda,"actually this movie really disappointed me because i wasn't expecting worst but now i can easily say for cem yilmaz he has to stop making a movie and he has to focus on doing a stand-up. he is not a good actor or director, basically he can not do couple of different job like you can not be a doctor, lawyer or police at the same time! if you can not handle it then stop doing it. DO NOT BE MONEY HUNGRY. just came from istanbul to new york and i couldn't stop my self to writing a review for this movie. i wish it's was better then what i saw but it s not.i watched this movie because of cast thats all i can say hopefully all crew and cast they will read this review and stop working with him but end of the day they have to earn money as well this is not an art anymore this is about money.",negative
Pek Yakinda,"Let me start by saying this movie is pretty darn good. Good acting, amazing cast, and the best of all are those tiny details that make you chuckle. This movie is by no means is just a run off the mill cheap comedy or a stand-up show.Watch it and pay attention to details.. You will at least like it if not truly enjoy it. Especially if you grew up in Turkey and know the ""Yesilcam"" culture. I loved all the references made those movies we all watched and loved as kids. Some of the reviews I read on this site was really unfortunate. I couldn't help but notice most of the bad reviews was also written in not so good English. Not trying to be mean or anything but please; just stop!!! (Not ""Green Pine"" like some idiot said. Seriously??? Do you call Hollywood ""Kutsal Odun""?) What's with you people? Anyway, bottom line is; I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend everyone to watch it. Keep up the good work Cem :)",positive
The Trip to Italy,"Could only be called two idiots abroad. Calculated 'rambles' and cringe-inducing dialogue of nothingness. Full screen filled with their fairly boring faces while frustratingly, Italy, in all its green and aromatic glory is reduced to playing a background fleeting extra. Beautiful food is given a brisk token summary of a Benidorm-type review, while unbearable fractured Italian and pompous guide-book knowledge makes one wish their inflated boat would sink immediately with their over-inflated egos.An arrogant treatment of Italy, combined with the most pathetic belief that these two have anything interesting to say, will leave you searching for Italian for 'where is a Borgia when you need one?""",negative
The Trip to Italy,"Wonderful film that gets better every time I watch it. Touching, poignant and hilarious. Puzzled by spate of poor IMDb reviews but suspect that some Cougan fans might not be familiar with the persona he plays in this film: a self obsessed, angst ridden clinging to Hollywood star called Steve Cougan. Or maybe they just like Jason Statham movies, which this is not. I love the locations, the gentle but ridiculous plot twists around Brydon, the anecdotes of Byron and Shelley, chats on ageing, air of melancholia at the end of each episode and the hilarious attempts to out do each other on vocal imitations of stars of yesteryear. I loved The Trip and I love The Trip to Italy. Don't expect action, just sit back, indulge and enjoy.",positive
Dum Laga Ke Haisha,"Prem (Ayushmann Khurrana) is persuaded by his family to marry for financial reasons to an overweight woman he doesn't find attractive. His new wife, Sandhya (Bhumi Pednekar ) is an educated woman who tries to make her marriage work, but Prem has no interest in so doing. They are persuaded to take part in the ""Dum Lagao"" contest, where the husband carries his wife on his back through an obstacle course, in so doing they reconcile.The premise of this movie is fantastic, but it just doesn't deliver. There is very little character development, less happiness, and an ending that is too sudden and not credible. Khurrana, who is too old for the role, wears a scowl the entire movie and plays his part one- dimensionally. Pednekar, in her first movie, is fantastic, giving depth to Sandhya, portraying believable emotions, and acting nearly flawlessly. Her performance is so good that she nearly saves the movie, but not quite.",negative
Dum Laga Ke Haisha,"DLKH brings the much needed freshness in Bollywood romance movies. And it comes with a very strong message woven around a very sweet love story. The direction is impeccable with moderated melodrama. Ayushmann Khurrana might never get the stardom like the Khans and the Kapoors but he is definitely one of those actors never afraid of doing path breaking movies and top them up with amazing natural acting - be it comedy or drama. But he gets a good competition from the new girl Bhumi Padnekar who delivers a very good performance, depicting a struggle of a fat girl in a white skin - size zero obsessed society of India. Sanjay Mishra, playing the role of Ayushmann's father, gives a memorable performance with really good dialog delivery topped up with brilliant comic timing. The length of the movie is unusually short for a Bollywood movie but then quality is always more important than quantity. Overall, for someone in a mood to watch a light romantic movie, your search ends at DLKH. This movie comes easily into the list of ""movies I can watch anytime"".",positive
Doua lozuri,I don't know if this film was lost in translation but I have honestly never seen such an unfunny supposed comedy. Yes I watched in English subtitles but atleast parts shouldn't be lost in translation surely. The main positive was that it didn't last all that long.,negative
Doua lozuri,"I happened to watch the movie inside the TIF film festival. I wasn't expecting much, cause it seems Romanian movies tend to follow a pattern. This was not the case, and it was such a nice surprise. A good script, with awesome dialogues and interactions. At the end of the movies the crew came to salute everyone and were opened to questions. The second surprise wasn't the fact that they were friendly and answered all the questions, but by the age of the crew and the ""lack"" of experience they said they have, even though by watching the film you would never experience is a issue. I haven't had the opportunity to watch it again, but if the opportunity appears for either of you I highly recommend you check it out. I did and made my day, Cheers",positive
2 States,"As a person brought up in a family with 2 states culture IRL this is just a cheap mockery of exaggerated stereotypes in a loud nonsensical lengthy Bollywood movie. Could not even get through the book but was hopeful at least the movie would do justice to the best kind of love stories in India. The real life issues of reactions of different family members, difference in opinions, some compromises in traditional value, concerns of extended family and how they come about to achieve a middle ground none of which was depicted in a proper way. It was borderline racist sometimes without being apologetic even when there was absolutely no requirement for scenes like that. And no, that never increased the humor quotient of the movie which was already as low as their standards. To summarize, it was as if a Hollywood romcom was made about interracial marriages where the family of the whites gifts fired chicken to the blacks and the blacks would get them all some guns as gifts because they are from Texas.",negative
2 States,"We all are quite familiar with movies which are based on novels, real- life stories, autobiographies etc. but few films exist which strikes the right chord! Many movies (in Bollywood) like 3 Idiots (2009), Kai Po Che (2013) have been adapted from novels of one masterpiece: Chetan Bhagat! He is the main reason behind the success of these movies and many others and again for the latest release of his novel ""2 States"" adaptation in Bollywood!! This movie is so wonderful and doesn't require any action scenes, over-the-top dialogues, old-typical themes etc. but the makers have given a remarkable effort with some minor changes as compared to the book!! So here we go:Story: The story is beautifully crafted!! 2 people of different culture, different states fall in love with each other. But whether they know the consequences they would face when they would face the discomfort and the pressures when people talk of inter-caste liaison, the unyielding love and the resolve to win the parents' trust, each and every aspect with the emotions included! Will they succeed in convincing their parents to get married or will their relationship would get over is the main plot of this film.Cast: Arjun Kapoor as Krish Malhotra is delightful!! After films like Ishaqzaade (2012) and Gunday (2014) where he has a goofy character, he truly succeeds in playing a sweet, simple kind of a guy who gives importance to his relationships! He charms and gives a meticulous performance! One of his finest performance till date!Alia Bhatt as Ananya Subramanium is first-rate!! She is beautiful yet witty and gives a delightful performance as a Tamil-Brahmin girl!! Her chemistry with Arjun is electrifying! We can say that Alia has now became an evolved actress and she knows when to capture emotions at the right time!!Amrita Singh as Krish's Mother is a revelation! She truly is fantastic as the typical Punjabi mother-in-law who justifies her role!! She steals the show in most of the scenes!!Ronit Roy as Krish's Father is extraordinary!! He develops an antagonistic relationship with his son but he is remarkable!! Watch out for the twist that he would get in the 2nd half!Shiv Subramanium and Revathy as Ananya's Father and Mother gives decent performances!! They are quite efficient!!Direction: Director Abhishek Varman should deserve the Best Debut Director in next year's film awards! He truly strikes the right chord!! He gives an remarkable effort but capturing sweet melodramatic scenes and wonderful emotions which come during the course of the film!! Both he and Karan Johar (Producer) have wonderfully executed a delightful film!!Music: The music of the film is exceedingly well!! The songs truly move you and will put a smile in your face!! Songs like ""Locha-e-Ulfat"" and ""Offo"" are best numbers which will make you groove along with it! ""Mann Mast Magan"" is a wonderful and top-notch song that steals your heart!!On the whole, 2 States is one of those rare Hindi films which have came in a long time and had explored us the diverse cultures, melodramatic scenes, problems of inter-caste marriages but one thing knocks all of it: ""Love""! It really empowers on all of the dizzy situations!! Strongly recommended to people of all age-groups and also to those who fantasize about diverse people!!",positive

Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2,"LoL the majority of average rating is coming from the feminist side i assume :D Well definitely the movie will give you a burst of laughter if you're a male and we were expecting exactly the same, the movie live to the hype of the PKPN1. In beginning i wasn't expecting it to stand any where near to its prequel but i'm glad that i was wrong.Though Thakur couldn't gel up as a replacement for Chaudhary, i personally feel the boys cast should be the same... missed the bonding of Rajjo, Liquid and Chaudhary but Chouka takes that place as a nice replacement package. Its a story that revolves around women's 1. the money minded.. 2. the best friend conscious.. and 3. girl concerned with family... the movie scenes were well shot and Anshul/Gogo monologue is longer, better and epic.I will agree to the fact that First half is more fun and dominant over the second but the story ends really well Talking to their mothers;)Don't listen to any1, if u r a fan of first PKPN you will definitely enjoy this movie without any disappointment, cheers!!",positive
Taxi,"Too much hype about nothing . You will be bored to death . Panahi is critical of the Iranian government not letting him making western style movies . He has forgotten it was the Iranian government who paid the bills for his previous movies therefore he became world famous . This is the ultimate ungratefulness biting the hand that has been feeding him. He can be critical of anything he likes . However , he should be honest with the audience as well . He has made this movie basically for the western audience and forgetting his own traditional roots. During the time of the Shah there were directors who criticized the government without being selfish and did a good job like the fantastic movie ""The Cow"". He is wasting his talent in order to please foreigners . Two thumbs down .",negative
Taxi,"Going into a screening of this film, there are a couple of things an audience should know. In 2010 Jafar Panahi, was arrested for making a film against the Iranian regime. Since then he has not been allowed to make films, leave the country or participate in interviews. Taxi, however, is his third film since the ban, and even though it's filmed entirely within the confined space of a taxi, it shows us the streets of Tehran.

Premam,"Yes yes Nivin Pauly has acted well but more than that it was the director's vision which gave this movie its heart. The storyline is nothing new - a young carefree lad George falls in love for the first time and many times thereafter and how his outlook of the world changes with each lady love of his life. Alphonse Puthren gave a new life to the script with his impeccable cinematography and detailing. Each and every role is etched perfectly and acted with excellence. The roles played by the support actors as George's best friends tingle your heart because when their friend is heartbroken they cry with him too. After a very long time has a movie come where the emphasis is not on the family drama but on the adopted family that we get as our friends. The background score of the movie is excellent keeping up with the tempo of the movie frames. Though I felt there were a couple of unwanted scenes here and there but whole and whole it was a good entertainer. P.S.- Nivin Pauly looks stunning in that black shirt, mundu and those aviators..!! *sigh*",negative
Premam,"""What a way to refresh yourself.."" This is what came to my mind after watching this film. Being a great fan of the mastermind Alphonse Puthren and his debut film Neram, this didn't disappoint me. But it did impress me.It may not be a life-changing, mind-blowing film. But a clean romantic comedy that lies closer to reality than you think. Unintentional and situational comedy that shows up almost in every scene of the film, can clean your mind of any stress or anything of that sort that you have at the moment.The direction of the film as usual is exemplary. The edits (that too done by the director) certainly utilities the factor of directorial edited films. The film certainly lacks a story but that factor is hidden by the beautifully captured visuals thanks to the cinematographer, Anend. Screenplay is good. Production value and art was natural at it's level best as most of the places shown in the film originally exists.The film is divided into 3 acts that covers 3 stages of the life of George, a care-free living youngster - the first one covering the romantic relationship of George while studying in 12th grade is the shortest one of the film. The second covering his collage life is the longest and the most stylish\epic one among that, making it my favorite. The last act shows the life of George after his collage life, now a working class fellow. The film's main plot is based on 3 different women that George fell in love with during the 3 different stages.Simple and elegant plot which lags a bit in the last half hour is the only problem with the film that I saw.Positives :-1. Nivin Pauly himself is a great asset to the film. The film too should be a great asset to him as this film is the best work I saw from him. He has improved his weaknesses like acting out emotional scenes and dance. OMG, the wonderful dance choreographed by Sai Pallavi is amazing. And Nivin has danced it to perfection.2. All other male stars. When I say this I mainly mean none others that Krishna Sankar and Shabareesh Varma. Shabareesh does a kind of one man show which is my other favorite of the film. Being a lyricist and a singer, the actor have given all his level best performance at all areas. Vinay fort, Maniyanpilla Raju was also good. 3. All the three lead actresses were pretty good. Mostly Sai Pallavi who changed the entire course of the film with her cute performance as Malar miss smile emoticon4. Wonderful cameos. There are a lot of cameos throughout. First one being Jude Anthony as Jolly D' Cruz. Then there is Renji Panicker as David who did a stylish role with the superbly written dialogs from his own films. Finally there is the director himself as Ronnie who is a drug addict and the only or mainly the villain of the film.5. Superb stunt scenes. There is hardly 2 scenes of fights in the entire film and the main one in that being George's collage intro. I sure wished there was more of that frown emoticon6. Amazing cinematography and superb Edits.7. The best soundtrack I've ever heard along with Chandrettan Evideya and Neram.Negatives :-1. A little lag that happens the final half hour.Verdict - Premam is a surely must watch entertainer",positive
Tanu Weds Manu Returns,"Killed all the goodwill created by original Tanu weds Manu.Killed romance, killed innocence sweetness and respectful relationships. Madhavan character goes from shy handsome NRI boy to confused perverted prick running behind teenage girls. Kangana character goes from liberal revolting teenager coming to her senses eventually, to a drinking slut who has affairs with everyone from rickshaw walla to a brotherly relative. She puts her husband in mental asylum, goes on a hawas trip to find suitable match for herself while still married. Jassi turns from a gabru sardar to impotent wimp, payal from a sensible UP girl to evil housewife who hides from her husband that he is not really father of their baby.And wine and alcohol industries must have paid serious money to production house becoz they are promoting drinking like anything. Everybody is drinking in every scene of the movie. Watch out for your urges and your liver! 3 stars for datto's character and all the laughs.",negative
Tanu Weds Manu Returns,".....after you have been mentally slaughtered on an over-hyped film like Bombay Velvet the week before, TWMR is a breath of fresh air. Excellent script, great direction and wonderful performances make this a must-watch romantic-comedy.The attention to detail in character design, setup and dialects is worth mentioning. Even if you haven't watched the prequel, it stands on it's own right and leaves you with a feel good happy feel. It slightly loses it's grip somewhere close to the climax, but that aside, it's brilliant. Go and enjoy!",positive
Ocho apellidos vascos,"Utter Tosh. A highly predictable dirge of a film taking stereotypical characters (lazy but cheerful Andalusians, defensive nationalistic Basques) and then placing them in situations to which you know exactly how it is going to finish. The comedy is supposed to be slapstick and an ironic look at the two distinct areas of Spain but it quickly becomes tedious and in places offensive. It's repetitive (proud Basque father, intimidated daughter, happy go lucky Sevillian) and would be fine as a five minute sketch. Despite this being one of the highest grossing films in Spanish Cinema, many Spanish friends of mine have also commented how ""simple"" and childish the comedy is. A case of the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" as there is nothing really here. Truly truly horrible.",negative

Chinese Puzzle,"The threequel to 'Pot Luck' and 'Russian Dolls', 'Chinese Puzzle' picks up the story of French writer Xavier (Romain Duris, engaging as ever). He's now married to Briton Wendy (Kelly Reilly), with whom he has two children. His Belgian lesbian chum Isabelle (Cécile De France) is obsessing about having children and Xavier agrees, against Wendy's wishes, to provide the sperm with which Isabelle will be artificially inseminated (who said romance was dead?) Meanwhile, Wendy meets an American and sets up home with him in New York, taking her and Xavier's children with her. Distraught at losing contact with the children, Xavier relocates to New York himself. But will he ever find lasting love?There are many things casually presented as acceptable here which some may take issue with (eg the self-indulgent, artificial creation of children in a time of over-population; visa-convenient marriages). But this film is so feel-good that even a grouch like me sat grinning - or laughing out loud - for much of it. Returning players Duris, De France and Audrey Tautou slip on their former roles with ease; Reilly's acting I found a bit too soap operaish. Of the new characters, Jason Kravits, as Duris' sleazy lawyer, does a fine comic turn. The film is pure entertainment - in fact, if it weren't for Xavier and Wendy's annoyingly precocious, wise-beyond-his-years son, it would be near perfect. But this is still another splendid chapter in Cédric Klapisch's romcom saga.",negative
Chinese Puzzle,"I haven't seen the two previous movies by the same director and actors preceding this one, but all by itself I loved this one. It is funny, witty, interesting and unusual. I understand the previous two movies portrayed the lives of characters at an earlier age. Now they are around 40 years of age, they are in NYC and they have different set of problems. I participated in a Q&A with the director at the end of the movie and I understand what he is trying to portray is a generation of people who are more mobile, who aren't afraid of mixing with different cultures, live in different countries, deal with the challenges presented by this new country. Movie has a very very positive, upbeat look at things. And it is very refreshing to have this positive outlook considering how many movies feeds of drama and difficulties almost to a degree, which makes them unrealistic. Life is not so bad and things don't go that bad in real life. You might get lucky at things. This movie has a positive, realistic look at life. I could easily relate to it. Loved it, highly recommend it. Especially if you want to laugh a bit and feel good about life. And there is nothing wrong with that.",positive

The D Train,"Dan Landsman has never been the cool guy, but that's about to change, if he can convince Oliver Lawless, the most popular guy from his high school who's now the face of a national Banana Boat ad campaign, to show up with him to their class reunion. A man on a mission, Dan travels from Pittsburgh to LA and spins a web of lies to recruit Lawless. But he gets more than he bargains for as the unpredictable Lawless proceeds to take over his home, career, and entire life........Jack Black has had one of the strangest careers in Hollywood for a once A-list star. The School Of Rock, in my opinion, was very mundane, but it rocketed him into the big time, and kudos to him, it opened many doors, and for a while, he was everywhere.But then he went down the Mike Myers route, and the biggest films he's done in the last ten years are about a talking panda. I always preferred him in a little Independent movie like Bernie, or as a supporting character (his turns in The Cable Guy and High Fidelity were scenes stealing turns).And let's not forget he played a wannabe 'Rastafarian' in I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.But here, he's really sank to a new low, and his career is now sitting comfortably with Cuba Gooding JRs as having the biggest career nose-dive in history.Dan is one of the most unlikable, selfish, insufferable characters a 'comedy' has ever seen. The man lies, cheats, steals, and ignores his sons needs in order for him to be popular for once, and you what? It's give me some sadistic pleasure when his world came crashing down around him.But what makes it worse is that he has such a nice family, and such a comfortable existence, so what if the rest of the alumni don't invite you for a drink, get over it, stop being bitter, and know your priorities in life.Things only go from bad to worse when Marsden 'enters' into the fray, the writers decide, for some reason, that Dan will do anything, literally anything to be popular and win the day.And then the film turns almost into a psycho obsessive movie, and Dan almost turns almost a Rupert Pupkin style personality change, because Lawless is doing what Dan should be doing, paying a little attention to his son.But don't worry, this films message is 'be a nasty person, be abhorrent towards the ones closest to you, because they are like dogs, their love is unconditional.It's truly one of the most nastiest, vilest, pieces if filth I've ever seen, and I really hope it vanishes without a trace.",negative
The D Train,"Many may not want to admit this, but ""D"" Train happens more often than not. This subject matter of a bromance gone to an awkward level is a welcome addition in a time where fluid sexuality is a pervasive theme within todays hot topics. I understood the film and its purpose, and grant kudos to the filmmakers for what they were going for. The film focuses on life's ups and downs of Dan (Jack Black) as he orchestrates a reunion with an old high school popular guy. To his surprise, the encounter turns fun until one night of drunken partying leads to a ""moment"" neither protagonist is soon to forget. Unfortunately for Dan, his constantly wanting to repress what happened leads him to deal awkwardly with those who surround him back in his small quiet hometown. On other hand, the film perfectly encapsulates the character of Oliver Lawless, a struggling actor who finds an opportunity to feel what its like to be wanted and adored with attention when his true life is less than what his image portrays. The scenarios that are taking place in this film are to be given credit and much consideration for they are truly deep seeded issues dealing with mens interaction with one another, masculinity and society's expectations. Oliver's arrival into town for the class reunion only worsens the situation as Dan becomes a walking time bomb. He's got mixed feeling about Oliver and does not know how to deal with it. So he has sudden outbursts of rage and anger as the film progresses into an abrupt final act for both men. The film succeeds in showing the inner struggles and emotional turmoil many men, Im sure, have endured in similar situations. I feel the filmmaker dealt with the subject matter in a realistic way for these situations tend to be naturally awkward to begin with. To sweep such raw feelings under the carpet can really take its toll if left unattended. I do recommend this film, not for being a comedy, even though some of the awkward moments did elicit a chuckle or two, but because there is depth here and very interesting ideas and themes that the film deals with simultaneously in a very fresh and original way. This may not be the comedy most will be expecting to see, but I suggest you give the film a chance. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the show!",positive
Simmba,"My original review which got more than 300 likes got deleted cos the fellas associated with this lousy film cannot digest opinions. IMDb is flooded with fanboys of lousy actors who cannot respect opinions.I never put spoilers, or abusive or irrelevant stuff.
This proves that IMDb of lately been hijacked by fake reviews.I can still copy paste my review which is saved but this time I jus want to write something different.
As a fan of Ajay Devgan, I am really shocked that he agreed to star in this pathetic film.
The overacting by the lead actor became an enduring torture to sit thru.
The script, direction, acting, editing n cinematography, r all worse than Ed Wood films.Massive narrative sinkholes, outstanding disbelief in the muddled writing and shockingly pathetic over acting. This film is a torture to sit thru n without a doubt the most inept and atrociously awful film ever made.",negative

Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods,"OK just to make it clear, the guys who reviewed it and gave it a 9 out of 10, aren't DBZ fans at all.I've loved that manga since early 90's, as a teenager, and loved all OVA (first broly being the best of them all) . I brought in a friend that is a huge fan too, relaxed, closed curtains, watched the movie... and we waited ; we waited for the story to skip the poor jokes and so on. Until I realised it was exactly designed the same way the previous Tarble anime was, poor humour, poor enemy's design, motivation, etc. The realisation is OK, but I really can't believe Akira Toriyama took part into that , and if so, I would be ultimately disappointed. How can people consider that to be a dragon ball movie, when there is only kawai fan service? Bills, is an absolutely empty shell character, the story is for kids. If you're over 10 , you might really be upset about this being called Dragon Ball. Only time we probably enjoyed was the overall 5-10 minutes fighting sequence, and that was really to say that something was still kind of brought back from the old DBZ and updated with today's technical improvements. So to summarize : if you're a real hardcore DBZ fan (meaning you didn't even wasted your time watching GT, as I did) , you'd better skip this movie, even if I know curiosity will prevail, but don't' have huge expectations, this is simply the WORST dragon ball movie I've ever seen. My buddy asked me seriously if that was a dragon ball parody movie or if it was real... Please Toei guys and Toriyama san , if you read that, please never do that again to your real fans. You just dealt a fatal blow to that magic manga that dragon ball is , and I'm not sure I'd go for a next movie if it's so bad. You have been warned guys.",negative
Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods,"Finally for all these days it came true, A new Dragon Ball Z Movie came up.I was so happy to hear the news for the first time, guess what? i was the one who requested and added this page to IMDb just to let the world know about the movie more and share its information as IMDb is the best for it.I love the Akira Toriyama's story in this, the battles so intense, loved watching it :D and the way story lines ended, seems as in Future we could see more of Dragon Ball Z, hoping for a new Series just like before and i am hearing rumors that there will be one? i believe there should be one as now we know there is 7 other Universe in it, wow hoping that there will be few more people like Goku who are just as or more powerful than him, Akira PLEASE WE WANT MORE!!!",positive
Samba,"This movie about the trials of Samba, a Senegalese illegal immigrant's life in Paris is from the director and lead actor Omar Sy that brought us The Intouchables, and suffers from revisiting the fish out of water relationships that underpinned that earlier film less convincingly. I just couldn't swallow the attraction that brought Alice, a burned out recruitment executive and Samba together, and most of the other central characters such as Wilson (Tahar Rahim) were superficial or unbelievable. The best aspect was raising the issue of how western societies treat refugees and illegal migrants. But overall it lurched between slapstick and serious without the glue of characters one cared about to hold it together.",negative
Samba,"As some have noted before, it is a light-hearted movie on a serious topic (undocumented immigrants) but always respectful at that.I cannot quite agree with the reviewers that did not see the humor in this movie (I laughed about every three minutes throughout - expect towards the end - and sometimes even cried at the same time). Neither can I understand how people can say that the characters are flat or even ""boring"". Imho, the film succeeds in portraying them in not just black and white; each of them (and there are many!) evolves within the 120 minutes so much so that, in fact, it is not about the immigrants being the ""angels"" and the immigrant officers being the ""devils"" at all. On the contrary, lines are blurred very early on and especially in the end.I find that this is a worth successor of ""Untouchables""; I probably even prefer it. It is a very moving film (similar to the documentary ""l'Escale"") but without trying to be so. Also, the actors are brilliant! (Omar Sy, I think, even manages to mimic a Senegalese accent.)",positive
Astérix: Le domaine des dieux,"I was a big fan of the original ""Asterix"" comic books when I was a kid. Still am, as a matter of fact. So when I came across this French computer animated adaptation of the Asterix comic book ""The Mansion of the Gods"" on Netflix, I was curious to see how well it would be done. I still remember very well the particular Asterix comic book this movie adapted, and I have to say this adaptation is pretty well done. The second half of the movie pretty much stops following what happened in the comic book in order to do its own thing (and to stretch the story to feature length), but the changes to the story do feel straight out of a typical Asterix comic book. The humor (and there's plenty of it) has the exact tone, and happens to be pretty funny. The computer graphics don't quite have the Hollywood polish, but they are colorful and acceptably detailed. The only caution I would deliver to potential viewers is to inform them that they should read some of the original Asterix comics first before watching this movie, since there are some (minor) details that might be confusing for those not familiar with the comics.",negative
Astérix: Le domaine des dieux,It's everything a movie about Asterix should be.The spirit found in Uderzo & Goscinny works breathe true this movie. The subtle humor and those sweet eye winks like the authors always did in their books. The best Asterix animation to this day and trust me i've been a fan for 40 years. A total delight for the family and even for people who don't know Asterix world and the characters it will be easy to get to know them and have a lot of good laughs.I have been really please and surprise by this animation as all movies done about Asterix were not as authentic and enjoyable like this.I definitely wishing they do another one soon!!!,positive
Meet the Blacks,"My first review, and maybe my 3rd or 4th rating. 
I love the most movies and series, so I never rate them if it isn't amazing. But this movie is a waste of time. 
I saw 14 minutes and stopped it. The next day I saw 20 minutes more, just to give lt a chance but it suuuucks! It's so cringy and stupid without being funny. The cast is ok but they can't act in this movie because the script is SO terrible. Later that same day I thought ""watch the movie maybe it's ok"" but now I just wanna sue both netflix, the cast, the producers and the writers. 
Don't watch this crap it's a wate of time and your life.",negative
Meet the Blacks,At this point if you are still trying to break down a parody movie from every angle and inspect it then you are wasting your time. Parody movies are literally designed to not be a good movie. The only thing it's for is to make you laugh. Everyone knows this so why every time a new one is made people expect more? Honestly these type of movies are for people who like to laugh and usually don't care how it turns out. I understand some of you may feel if it's a theatrical release then it should be at least worth the money but it's very hard to please everyone when it comes to music and art and it has always come down to a preference thing. I am giving this a 10 out of 10 because it made me laugh the whole time and that's all these movies are made for. I expected nothing else from it and I got nothing else from it.There was no great story line or amazing actors just good Ole parody humor.,positive
"Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ""F""","If you are like me (a passionate DBZ fan who grew up diligently tuning in to every episode) then you'll be ashamed with how this latest instalment scars the legacy created during our childhood. There's getting it wrong and then there's getting it horribly incorrect and DBZ have achieved the latter with this time waster, if you asked me to describe it in 3 words they'd be 'rushed, sloppy' I know that's only 2 words but in truth this film doesn't deserve a third word, it also didn't deserve my attention for however long I spent pushing my eyes towards suicide. I can only think that this was directed and funded by people who dislike DBZ, that would describe the plot with unforgivable holes all over the place and the so called action which is dreadful and painful to watch, Goku probably needs to sue DBZ for terrible misrepresentation of his character. Anyone that says this rushed, unchoreographed, pathetic excuse of a film is good would've been paid a big fee to say so, I can honestly say the best part of this film is the credits, retire now DBZ!!!",negative
"Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ""F""","This is the Dragon Ball Z Movie experience I always wanted. While Battle of Gods was an amazingly fun light-hearted adventure, this is the badass action-packed DBZ that we wanted since the Cell Saga.Goku and Vegeta have now ascended to Gods with Whis as their new master. I absolutely loved the exploration of Goku and Vegeta's character dynamics and development throughout the training scenes, with Whis not only being a physical mentor but a spiritual one as well. Bills provides much of the comedy in his own unique manner as one of the best new DBZ Characters ever. Speaking of new characters, I'm pleasantly surprised by Frieza's new minions, especially Sorbet as he's actually useful throughout the movie and not just fodder like the rest of Frieza's army. The invasion scene was amazing as it put the Z warriors back in the spotlight and gave the movie some much-needed tension. Especially Gohan; not since his fight with Cell has he been this badass!Speaking of badassery, the very definition of the word, Vegeta, finally gets his time to really shine (there are no stupid bingo scenes in this one...) - it is straight up brawls in that over-the-top fashion we all know and love delivered by the Prince of all Saiyans.In the end, the 15th DBZ Film featured the return of the greatest Anime villain of all time: Frieza in a Battle of Gods with the Super Saiyan God Goku. It's just classic!",positive
The Second Mother,"Of course .Everyone knows that if you are rich, you are idiot, miserable ,fat and you smoke joint all day along.But if you are poor you are genius ,and kind .It is something like Mexican tv series cliche.However, it has good shots, and actors are very good.I could be a lot better with fewer cliche .",negative
The Second Mother,"It's not everyday that we get a film like this, not willing to really dive into the political, social issues that pervade everyday life, and the cultural barriers and differences that micro- aggressions really make. The acting in this is superb, especially from Regina Case. It's all very natural and in the vein of real life, to an almost unbearably disturbing extent. The screenplay and directing are superb. None of it is at all showy, but it all builds up to quietly powerful, and deeply emotional, moments and scenes. The characterization is rich and it all really sneaks up on you in terms of its effect. definitely recommended, although it's not for those wanting loud or showy extravaganza.",positive
Piku,"Anything shot with a movie camera cannot be called a film if it is simply loaded with television aesthetics. Hindi film 'Piku' is one good example of an atrociously horrible piece of junk shot on a film camera. This so called 'film' is nothing but a vulgar collection of crude scatological jokes and references about an old man suffering from constipation. It is not only the theme of the film which would afflict the viewers but also the bad performances by its so called 'stars'. Amitabh Bachchan is a complete disaster as an eccentric old man who tries hard to imitate a Bengali man's accent but fails miserably. He is causing irreparable damage to his iconic image by doing roles which do not do any justice to his personality. The Amitabh Bachchan factor is surely missing in this film as nobody would bother to applaud actor Amitabh Bachchan playing an old man's role. To add insult to the injury,there is also icing on the cake in the form of mediocre overacting by Deepika Padukone and Irrfan Khan. This Bollywood disaster has been promoted as a work of art about a father/daughter relationship. However, the truth is that it tries to mix elements from different genres and fails miserably. For this reason, audiences are visually tortured in the name of a drama to watch a flop film which also shows an insipid road movie and a drama about ancient versus modern in the form of the sale of an old house. Lastly, if your staple diet of entertainment revolves around insipid comedy shows shown on Indian television, Piku is the ideal piece of nonsense for you. Those who worship cinema as an integral form of art are advised to stay away from this piece of inane, puerile madness.",negative
Piku,"Just like Bhashkor Banerjee doesn't like liars I wouldn't want to keep my readers in dark for long. I just loved the film. I loved each bit of this film from the core of my heart. It is the best (if there is any other) slice of life, road trip film to have come out of Bollywood in recent history. The film has all the ingredients to be a wonderful cinematic journey and it just doesn't fail. It has the star of the millennium leading from front. Many would also go to the extent of calling him the actor of the millennium as well and I would rather choose to agree than to disagree. It also has one of the best character actors that Bollywood has today. It also has someone by the name of Deepika Padukone who is no way close to the other two when it comes to acting but she is learning and she must get the credit for that. Not to miss out on the fact that she also manages to take your attention on the screen away from none other than Big B himself, courtesy her charm. She plays her part well enough to make the film a joyous journey. And over all this you have Shoojit Sircar, who has now started to show glimpses of brilliance through simplicity, a tag that has been associated with Basuda and Hrishida for long. He seems to have perfected the art of taking difficult subjects and turning them into supremely smooth slice of life films.The film never gets distracted from its central subject which is Bhashkor Banerjee's stomach just like the Banerjee family never gets time to discuss anything else. The film is a joyride for the whole of 2 hours and 5 odd minutes. It makes you laugh out loud for phases lasting from few minutes to tens of minutes, only to slice new layers of sensitivity in the next few. Even though the span of the film is a few days, Sircar so skilfully is able to show us the deeper traits of all the characters that you begin to relate with each one of them. There are hardly any weaknesses in the film, but the strongest of strengths is the realness of the film. There are quite a few slice of life films that Bollywood has been able to create in last few years, none is as natural as this.The film begins with a lot of fast edits, which are required when you have a real Bengali situation with real people trying to make multiple points unintentionally moving towards a chaotic confluence of non-ideas. The film could have easily made use of quite a few cinematography tricks to please you on the road trip, but why would it ever need to con the audience when it has such amazing character waiting to give you a free laugh and a cheerful tear. Instead, he uses Anupam Roy's brilliant voice and composition to blend with the screenplay. There are surely quite a few stereotypes that the film breaks and at the same time there are few it doesn't because some stereotypes just don't go.At 70, Amitabh Bachchan is still at the top of his game. If you have ever been a big Bachchan Saab fan and have not got the best of him lately, this is going to be your dope. His comic timing will put all comedians of today put together to shame. The way he has played the part of an over anxious, ageing and well-meaning Bengali is only something that he could have done and no one else. Needless to say the reason why Irrfan Khan is who he is today is his natural dialogue delivery and he does it again. Every time he delivers a dialogue or even when he communicates in silence, it becomes a treat to watch.As the story of the film moves ahead, the landscape shifts from the crowded Delhi roads to the 'cultured' streets of Calcutta. Each frame shot in the last 20 minutes of the film will rekindle your love for the city of joy and would want to make you go there again, not just for the aesthetics of the frame but because it speaks through the character of its wood and the structure of its soul. I would not want to spoil anything for you, but I can not not mention the scene where the 70 year old Bhashkor Banerjee rides a bicycle and wanders through Calcutta's core with the look of a child. You would want to watch these five minutes again and again.Go watch Piku today, and don't just leave it at the theatres, bring it home through your hearterr.stomach.",positive
Telling Tales,"We know the director and writer of 'Bana Masal Anlatma' since 'Leyla and Mecnun' which was the most popular comedy in Turkey, actually still it is. The man who I am talking about is Burak Aksak. It is widely accepted, everyone who watched Leyla and Mecnun, including me, want to watch a film is produced by Burak Aksak. This is his first movie. Pretty successful but the film has lots of mistakes in it. According to me, whole mistakes are acceptable because the director and the movie reach one's goal that is amusing us. If you do not care details of the film, you would have fun. Nonetheless, I would like to talk about the biggest one.The love between Jilet (Gürkan Uygur) and Neriman (Gökçe Bahadır)... We do not know what happened before everything, also we cannot imagine what happen next.On the other hand, It was so ironic that Cengiz Bozkurt is playing a character who is stingy. This was ironic due to he played similar role in Leyla and Mecnun.In addition, all witticisms are staying away from swearing and bad words. Therefore, we can see creativity of the writer who is Burak Aksak.Finally, If you want to laugh and miss Leyla and Mecnun go to the cinema and watch ""Bana Masal Anlatma"". You would not regret but like I said, do not mind about details.",negative
Telling Tales,"Technically flawless, perfectly natural, and hilariously funny.Writer&director Burak Aksak put an extraordinary performance, similar to his previous works like Leyla ile Mecnun and Ben de Özledim. The story is very natural and warmhearted.

The actors credit include both young and talented actors beside very experienced and master actors in Turkish Cinema.As a person whose life mostly is based on dramatic events, this movie made me burst into tears with amazingly funny and extremely emotional scenes.

Story is not that much interesting, and could be completed within 1 Hour and 50 Minutes. But No...!! Rohit Shetty pulled it with boring dialogs and drama scenes. Songs starts when they are undoubtedly NOT REQUIRED. there is a part in movie when there are 2 songs in 15 minutes of interval.

I wanted to walk out of the theater in the first ten minutes itself, but somehow sat in for the whole movie. The movie starts with an absurd fighting sequence that is stretched beyond any reason. The movie is too cheesy and Salman Khan looks like a dimwit for even agreeing to act in this movie. No character, no substance and a total waste of time!

Kelebekler,"I watched this at the festival when it was presented.
I had plenty of people around me laughing hard for every single sentence (often serious dialogues) but I didn't. I thought to myself may be I am in a bad mood today because this is not funny at all.
When eventually after the projection the lights were turned on and there was the QA session with the director I looked around and I got the answer to my question: pretty much all the audience was Turkish.
I guess it's true what they say about Turkish and Indian films, they are really good for nationals but fail to make it internationally because they are not understood by other cultures.
If you think I'm harsh ask yourself if you would laugh to sentences like e.g.:
mom killed herselfa suicidal man left a note: sometime I feel good sometime I feel badIf you do I guess you have a Turkish sense of humor and this movie is indeed for you.There were 4 times where I think I smirked but the overall ""have to laugh for everything"" approach spoiled those moments too.",negative

The Meddler,"The movie starts in an Apple Store where Susan Sarandon buy a new Iphone. She explains that the 64GB model is better than the 16GB one. After few minutes she is at a pre maman party, and gift the new mother with an iPad. She explains that it's a very good gadget, that you can install things on it, and the young mother wows very loud at the tablet.

At the 15 minutes mark we are at her daughter's house, and on the bed we can see a Macbook.

The Meddler,"Characters like Marnie, the role played by Susan Sarandon in this film, I find really hard to tolerate. In fact I wasn't going to watch the film but decided to only because I knew Sarandon would elevate it. And now, having read some of the reviews here, I realize how comparable it was to Sally Field's recent film, My Name is Doris.What these two films share in common, besides being made watchable thanks to the talents of their respective main star, is that they were character portrayals of the aging baby boomer as a childlike character.As an aging baby boomer female myself, I found myself asking, with both films, but I'll stick to The Meddler here, did Marnie take too many drugs in her youth? Because there's something so innocent, spaced out, cutesy, and ultimately kind of brain dead, about her.Reviewers have referred to her as happy, cheerful, smiling, caring, etc. which are all accurate, but when I ask myself, is she someone I'd like to spend time with, or even have as my mother, my answer is a resounding No. Maybe because in my own family I was the ""adult child"" I think I'd have to assume that role with Marnie, too. Because frankly she fits into la la land so perfectly. And I always feel that characters/people like that are able to get away with something that I can't. Which is all to say watching The Meddler was a mixed experience.",positive

Let's throw together some quirky characters, get a couple of names, create an unlikely scenario, toss in a few cliches, an appropriate sound track and stir. There was nothing overly entertaining in the film, yet at the same time I wasn't bored waiting for something to happen. For those who can't get enough of the clever and quirky indies, you might get a quick fix from this film.Parental Guide: F-bomb. Sex.",negative

He is constantly undermined by his loved ones, and it does not feel great to be him. I feel for him, and I think Sam Rockwell does well in making me care for his character. Douglas' life changes quickly after Elizabeth arrives, some for the better and some for the worse. There is much food for thought, especially whether life is better through chemistry. The build up of the policeman plus DEA agent encounter is well done as well! It really got the character and me as well. I enjoy watching ""Better Living Through Chemistry"" a lot, as it gives people bits to chew on, reflecting on their own lives.",positive
Prince Avalanche,I watched this because it was billed as a comedy by IMDb. Recently I have noticed a trend for movies to be about absolutely nothing. Greenberg with Ben Stiller was one such disappointment. It was a mind numbing character study and it reminded me of Prince Avalanche inasmuch as I sat through the whole film waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did. At some point it just ended and I felt like an idiot for sitting through it.I'm a simple guy who likes his entertainment straightforward. I want to be taken away from reality for 90 minutes as I have enough of it already in my real life. Movies which just give us more of reality need to be clearly marked as such. Rant over.,negative
Prince Avalanche,"""Prince Avalanche"" is a great cinema experience for just about everyone. It begins as the ultimate road movie (literally, a pair of mismatched Texans spend their summer painting roads) but quickly takes a detour into a world of visual poetry, provocative characterizations and deep introspection. And all the while it manages to maintain a sense of brainless comedy that the storyline & DVD cover might lead us to expect.In spite of its grand visual setting in the majesty & desolation of fire-ravaged Texas, this is a very minimalistic production with just 2 main characters, 2 supporting characters and 10 or 20 miles of desolate Texas roads in the aftermath of the 1987 wildfires (it was actually filmed at the site of the 2012 Batstrop County fire). Being set in the 80s adds to the comedy & charm of this quirky flick. Be prepared to see Paul Rudd sporting a very ""Magmum P.I."" moustache and white tube socks with those 3 funky colored stripes at the top.There aren't a lot of big gags but instead the humor comes from the low-key bizarre dialogues between our 2 leads, ""Alvin"" (Paul Rudd) who is the self appointed leader because he's the self-proclaimed smarter of the two, and ""Lance"" (Emile Hirsch) who isn't the brightest doorknob. The laughs hinge on the weirdness of their discussions much like the hilariously strange banter between John Travolta & Samuel L. Jackson in ""Pulp Fiction"".In all, ""Prince Avalanche"" is an excellent show of what the French philosophers might call ""La Comedy Humaine"" with its poignant look at human nature. And at the same time the movie isn't so heady that it's above an occasional brainless laugh, like having the two fight & chase each other through the forest with axes.I wanted to mention 2 trivial tidbits in case you're interested in stuff like this: (1) The filmmakers note that no animals were harmed, so the occasional scenes of roadkill, fishing and what looked like a small skinned monkey for dinner were apparently props (this is good to know as a lot of indie films slip under the AHA radar and use real animals to save money on special effects), and (2) the excellent performance by supporting actress Joyce Payne (the woman in the ruins) was actually an unscripted addition to the film when they met Joyce, an actual ex-resident, while filming. As you will see, her character becomes pivotal to the story & meaning of the film, reminding us that great moments in cinema do often happen by accident.""Prince Avalanche"" is rated R which surprised me since there is no nudity, not much profanity and no violence. There are 1 or 2 dialogues about sexual situations which might get a bit racy for the kiddies, but other than that, this is a tame film. I highly recommend it to fans of Jim Jarmusch (""Down By Law"", ""Coffee & Cigarettes"") and Wim Wenders (""Million Dollar Hotel"", ""Lisbon Story"", ""Alice in the Cities"").",positive
Limonata,"I am also far from my homeland and that is why when I started to watch the movie I remembered the hardships of a foreigner and I found closeness in the character of Sakip. However after they leave for Bulgaria, I do not think movie is developing towards good, it is not developing at all. Dialogues are not the job of professionals at all. Sometimes you feel that they put that scene to just fill in the blanks. Too much bad language,always drinking and anger in every situation puts audience in a bad mood as movie rolls. Swearing that much,I think,beats even ""Snatch"". Acting was good especially of Sakip (Saban), directing not so much, but I see that it was the first job of Ali Atay. Scenario is not great, it has a great beginning but not a good ending, dialogues are like the whole film crew were in a hurry. Anger and swearing killed that closeness that I talked about earlier. And I saw at the end of the movie it was dedicated to someone's father and wife, I would not send a present full of negativity (anger and swearing) to my loved ones. I would send a present where there was at least a little bit of love. Yeah love is the missing part in this move. I am not talking about that ""love"", I am talking about compassion.

I found it to be a heartbreaking movie that made it appear as though love between an older lady and a younger man could not be possible. The old lady was very attaching and I loved her.

"Hello, My Name Is Doris","Sally Field gets the role of a lifetime as a hoarder working in a trendy office who has the hots for a younger employee. One of the best things about ""Hello, My Name Is Doris"" is that it shows how Doris is sort of an oddball and can irritate those around her, but is nonetheless a good person. She was the only sibling who took care of their mom. Basically, Doris wants to stick to her house and possessions, and their representation of the old days amid a world that advances too quickly for her, and her attraction to this younger man is the only possible sexual satisfaction for her. Most of all, it's refreshing to see a movie that focuses on older women (aside from Doris, there's her friend Roz, played by Tyne Daly). One of the most impressive scenes is when Doris gets photographed (and believe me, Sally Field looks sexy in some of those outfits that she wears).The long and short of it is that ""Hello, My Name Is Doris"" is a really good movie. Sally Field has gotten some of the best roles of her career later in life, and I hope that she continues to do so. She, Tyne Daly, and the rest of the cast put in fine performances. I recommend this movie to everyone.",positive
The Other Side of Hope,"The Other Side of Hope tells the story of a Syrian refugee and the challenges he meets in Finland. The film features his typical cinematographic style but the picture itself is disappointing.It is clear that Kaurismäki is much more at ease describing Finnish people. His Finnish characters are very funny and colorful, however when it comes to the refugee characters, he becomes shy and unimaginative.The main character Khaled is probably a very good person but he is a very boring character. More than that he does not look like a refugee; he looks neither tired, hungry or frustrated. He reminds one of a successful salesman or a post-doctorate student.His story is not compelling and his acting is not convincing. Kaurismäki received a specific commission and when making this politically correct movie he was afraid of making fun of foreigners or their religion. He even made the character an atheist which is highly unlikely for people from this country.Occasionally the film was funny, but only in the segments featuring Finns, The plot is not very interesting and does not have any twists or surprises. When undertaking this theme, Kaurismäki has shown that he does not know the topic or want to know it. Perhaps the biggest motivating factor was the funding he received to make this extremely politically correct picture.Read more at: http://indie-cinema.com/2017/02/the-other-side-of-hope/",negative

At the same time, Finnish businessman, Waldemar Wikström, buys a business and the two - very different - worlds of the main characters collide.The humour is dry, the Finnish 'tango' (ballad-singing) music is wonderful, I absolutely loved it.

It's a decent story with two men who are both pretty much going bankrupt meeting each other while drinking at the bar and then they end up making some money they desperately need when a rich guy starts offering them cash in exchange for performing different challenges for his and his wife's amusement. The money keeps going up to get them to do more and more things that get bigger and ever crazier.The best part of the movie is David Koechner's performance, he is really hilarious.Worth seeing but don't bother buying it or paying to see it at the theatre, it's just Okay.",negative
Cheap Thrills,"I did not expect to like this movie, but It slowly pulled me in with it's desperation, humor, horror, and ethical dilemmas.Cheap Thrills has a little story, but it's big in suspense, intrigue, and insanity.This movie excels at dark humor. Although the story becomes increasingly ridiculous, the character reactions are grounded enough that it makes the mayhem seem entirely plausible.There's also a subtle depth to the movie that begs to be explored. It's thought provoking while being mostly entertaining.",positive
Welcome to Me,"The director & writer should be ashamed of this film. All it does is spread MORE misinformation, misrepresent a horribly excruciating problem, and on top of that, exploits those with it.This is not even close to an accurate depiction of BPD, and this film will only do one thing- further stigmatize this horrible affliction, making people even more hateful & cruel, which is already a bad enough problem right now.Their complete misunderstanding of the disorder is nauseating. Don't see this movie. Don't see any movie about a character with BPD, because it has always been done ridiculously poorly & has stigmatized those with it further. To a huge degree.If you want to actually learn a bit about it, go to Wikipedia, and you will find a very accurate detailing of the disorder, without bias, prejudice or ignorance.",negative
Welcome to Me,"I cried the whole movie. Happy happy enlightening tears. I felt like I was watching my sister on screen. It felt like one big old metaphor being in the audience, as I feel kind of like an audience member of my own family.My sister who has BDP is the strongest person I know. This disorder is a rough one and those who have it are true warriors, however as a result of my sister's disorder, I have been neglected by my family my whole life. It took me a really long time to fully realize this, but now that I do I am finally starting to find self worth. This movie not only captures what it's like to have BDP, but whats it's like to close to someone with BDP. Seeing Alice's relationship with Gina hit me really hard. Gina is so strong and I hope I can be like her once I find more confidence in myself. Seeing her stand up for herself is something I hope I can one day do. The fact that someone out there decided to add some humor to such a hidden, stigmatized, mental illness, really truly brings light to the my broken heart. I am so so so so so so thankful for this movie. Bravo.",positive
Fukrey,"Fukrey has got its base trembling with a plot so naive, viewer discretion is recommended. Its screenplay is bit confusing for people who don't pay attention. Otherwise, it is a healthy Bollywood comedy film.Cast performance is nothing to talk about but the actors have managed to create enough chemistry between themselves. Although love doesn't come center-stage, it amuses. The music is catchy, but the lilts could've been improvised. Same theme music is used all over the 130 minutes. Cinematography, I would say, is brilliant especially shots involving mirrors. Editing is quite good.But, since the foundation itself is slimy, I rate it an AVERAGE 5.7/10. Mixing lucid dreams with reality doesn't really prove a point. The story in second half is much like Delhi Belly & other caper films where a gang try hard to please a big boss. It's a bit clichéd but the journey adopted by the Fukreys is enjoyable. They entertain and that is what matters.Dialogs are funny & straight, songs are good and overall, a fine comedy without classic cinema potential. Had expected more from the team.BOTTOM LINE: A sleeper hit that can be enjoyed once, with like-minded friends.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Fukrey,"Fukrey, directed by Mrigdeep Singh Lamba and produced by Farhan Akhtar/Ritesh Sidhwani is set in the bylanes of East Delhi and is about four youngsters who want to make it big in life - but through adopting shortcuts !Cocky Hunny(Pulkit Samrat) and goofy Choocha(Varun Sharma) are two slackers who want to get into a reputed college with the solo intention of ditching classes and ogling at girls. Accounting-phobic Laali (Manjot Singh)wants to get into this college because her lady love. Wannabe musician,Zafar(Ali Fazal)needs funds for his father's treatment. All of them need fast buck and make a deal with a wicked hustler,Bholi Punjabi(Richa Chaddha) but their adventure misfires big time when Choocha flounders.In this bizarre twist of events, how the band of boys come out unscathed forms the crux of Fukrey.Much of the film's sheen is derived from its situational humor and Mrigdeep Lamba , who made the horrendous Teen The Bhai, takes a giant leap in direction and writing with a sharp eye for details and getting the nuances of middle-class lifestyle of Delhi-ites right.The narrative is smooth and Lamba infuses some of the ROFL moments when Laali's bike parts are stolen each time outside the Gurudwara or Choocha escapes from Bholi's henchmen. Delhi Belly Dejavu !Choocha's inspection,oops I mean Inception-inspired dreams and Honey decoding them into a lottery number are sheer master-strokes !Ram Sampath's music is peppy and rustic with fresh voices and sync well with the proceedings. Ambarsariya, the traditional Punjabi folk song tops the list, with Sona Mohapatra's mellifluous renderings!The camaraderie depicted between Honey and Choocha is the heart of the enterprise and will have you in splits. Pulkit is endearing as the jugaadu-dude of the gang.His mannerisms are very typical of a Delhi boy and he gets the act right. Manjot Singh makes a solid impact with his straight-faced humor and impeccable dialogue delivery.Ali Fazal bores a serious look on his face and does justice to his character.Varun Sharma as Choocha is the scene-stealer and the real surprise package. As a debutante , he exudes ample confidence.Richa Chaddha outshines our fukras with her superb act of Bholi Punjaban and once again proves her supreme talent.Priya Anand and Vishakha Singh are adequate, and don't get much of scope in this male-dominated fare.Pankaj Tripathi,as usual,is first-rate.On the whole, Fukrey is indubitably a fresh wave of comedy with a fitting finale and a justified message to today's youth. I laughed and laughed , until my jaws ached and belly gave pangs.Worth a second time watch !Rating : 4/5",positive
Wyrmwood: Road of the Dead,"WYRMWOOD is a high energy zombie flick from Australia that combines the road movie genre with a classic zombie apocalypse outbreak type horror yarn. It has a little of the verve of VERSUS but in the end I found it quite predictable and a little overwhelming.What's clear from the outset is that this is one step up from being an amateur film. The look of the zombies is cheap, especially with those Halloween party contact lenses, although there's copious gore to help make up for this. The acting is of a generally poor quality, but the film goes for a semi-serious approach so that doesn't matter too much.What WYRMWOOD does offer is action in spades. There's barely any plot, just a handful of characters battling both zombies and some sinister scientists bent on human experimentation. None of it made much sense to me, but the director works hard to infuse his film with vibrancy and momentum, and he does succeed in part.",negative
Wyrmwood: Road of the Dead,"Okay, maybe not THE BEST 90 minutes of my life, but it's definitely up there! I'm quite critical of movies and this movie didn't disappoint. This movie starts at 100 miles an hour right out of the gate. It's nail biting, exhilarating with enough humor to get your belly moving! You can tell they didn't have a big budget, but the camera work and pace of the film definitely makes up for it. Hats off to the Roach-Tuner brothers in their first feature film. Looking forward to part 2...?",positive
David Brent: Life on the Road,"I can't believe that the producers of BBC allowed this movie to be released in its current state. It is cringeworthy, awkward, slow and boring - even the wonderful Ricky Gervais can't save it. The screenplay is terrible.... nothing much happens, there is no conflict set up and it is too reliant on Gervais. The worse thing is the tone of the film. We laugh at Gervais' character in The Office because he has a healthy ego and is relatively successful. In David Brent, Gervais plays a guy who is basically a loser who is shunned by everyone around him. It is so sad and desperate that you can't laugh at his socially awkward moments like you do in The Office.",negative
David Brent: Life on the Road,"OK, don't shoot me, I'm a humongous Ricky Gervais fan, ever since I saw The Office for the first time, so I may not be the most objective of people. But films are made for us all, including crazy fans like me, and we're all entitled to our opinion. And my opinion is - it is brilliant and I love it. I loved cringing all the time at Brent's pathetic ridiculousness, but I also loved his humanity and true heartbreak. I don't agree the film is over-sentimental. We get a chance to see Brent's soft side, though he's trying his best to hide it, and it's great. Ricky Gervais is an absolute genius at portraying this character, and I hope it's not the last we see of him. Additionally, since I have a chance to do it here, I want to express my admiration for Ricky Gervais as a person, a beautiful person who stands up for those who have no voice. RESPECT!!!",positive
Last Love,"1st off Michael is a widower, American living in Pars, a Philosophy Professor who was of course teaching at a top ivy league college. No one can teach in the Univ of Penn, or Michigan. Get tenure at any decent college is challenging. His accent is awful. really awful. Like an English is a 2nd language person who speaks good English. Couldn't he be an Englishman, who married an American and went to USA to teach. How come no one notices the bad accent, when casting and showing 1st scenes. Michael is a seasoned professional, didn't he listen to himself?There are other problems, with the characters and the plot development. but I prefer not to give any spoilers.it really is rather slow- and very sentimental (which means melodramatic, over the top)not a spoiler, but for instance, Parisian Clemence speaks very good English, but Micheal corrects her a few times, which would be understandable for someone who didn't speak well. For instance ""faites"" in French, is making or doing, so English could be doing or making depending on the action. She explained she speaks English well because her father, who she was close to, was American. so if she grew up speaking, she would know the correct English verb & phrases. Someone thought this ""charming""interlude should go into the dialogue, not 1X but 3X.it kind of meandered, so that I didn't know where they were going. Not a good thing.While sure, the Widower missed the love of his life, only gone 3 years, but these too many wonky scenes with him talking to his dead wife, didn't make for a good story.",negative
Last Love,"Michael Caine is getting old. Playing an old man, acting or real? He is at his best. Gone is his dry humor and whit, gone is also his regular British accent (apart from a few strongly emotional scenes when he suddenly looses the American accent he is supposed to have).This is a very odd movie, difficult to put into any frame. The acting is nothing else but superb, not a single moment without complete realism.Watch this move alone or with your significant other, do not forget the paper napkins, because this is very emotional. My eyes are still wet, this is a movie that will remain in my mind for a long time.",positive
Jolly LLB 2,"Besides a few jokes copied from whats-app, there is nothing worth watching in this movie. All the court procedures depicted are farcical and juvenile, and the movie is just stretched out beyond the point that an intelligent viewer can tolerate.The movie is advertised as something based on true events, but it is hard to imagine somebody taking this claim seriously.The lawyers are shown to be stupid and churlish, and the judge even more so.Such a wasted opportunity.

Kapoor & Sons,"Lot's of people and critics are praising about this movie. Some are saying that this is the best of this year up till now. But, frankly speaking, I'm not agree with these kind of statements or even these kind of positive reviews of this movie. Director Shakun Batra, who earlier directed Ek Main Aur Ek Tu, which was not a hit, comes back with this family drama. I must say it is far better than the previous one. The major plus point is the screenplay. Scenes have been written so well. Because of that, the shooting schedule had been completed in a shorter time, I guess. Actors are good. Location is suitable. Background score is perfect. And I think, because of the number of twists and turns is more in the post interval part, critics loved this film. But, I want to ask them, what about the boring portions in the first half!? Alia Bhatt is as cute as she looks earlier in her films. Sidharth Malhotra lacks in acting in some scenes. And I heard this statement from many viewers. Rajat Kapoor is good. Rishi Kapoor is funny and adorable. His make-up is the only time-taking thing in the whole movie. Two factors that affect the movie are Fawad Khan and Ratna Pathak Shah. She is the best actor of this movie. And for Fawad, if you please don't consider his character, haha, I like him. He looks hot and charming and stylish. So, a hero material has been found. He will go far and up. Chul song is a waste of time for me. Two background songs are good. Comedy is fine. Bhajan in iPad, Mandakini the heroine, the plumber asking for the money- these are my favorite comic scenes. So, I think this film is a one time watch. As I've seen Pyar Ka Punchnama 2 as an overrated movie last year, this movie stands for this category in this year. On the whole, I am confuse about what I get from the film. So the praising audience, who find out the meaning of life and relationships from this film, can you help me",negative
Kapoor & Sons,"Watching Bollywood movies , you get disillusioned seeing the crassness, but some producers/Directors know their Job well.this weekend release Kapoor and sons (since 1921) proved that right again .In simple words this movie shouldn't be missed.A family entertainer which churns your heart to the core and brings out that baby emotions hidden somewhere. Now coming back to film script is marvelous with all characters beautifully crafted,u long for each one of them, everybody have their problems and their own worries. Casting was done aptly, beautiful acting by all ,special mention Rishi kapoor he's your comic boy in this movie.songs are beautifully interwoven with beautiful lyrics with astutely crafted music.

G.B.F.,"This movie is very well made,never apologizing for anything, and why should it? There is a very unPCness delivered by an excellent cast who are all fully committed to the story, and a very well written story it just happens to be. Mean girls to the extreme, and full of tongue in cheek real life truthful feelings. The entire movie has great background, and the entire screen is filled very well most of the time, so you may Enjoy this a second time. Over all I really did like this movie, It started out kind of corny, but then the characters just fell into place, and they all start to become more real, and vulnerable. More of the truth begins to slip out before it all hits the floor. So I would recommend this for Mothers to watch with their Sons, and for others to just watch it, there is a lot of good humour in here, and a good feeling or 2 to be had as well.",positive

Witching and Bitching,"This fast paced, Spanish film is simultaneously a really disturbing horror tale, a meditation on the battle of the sexes, and one of the funniest movies I've seen in years. Things get off to a lightning start with a holdup of a gold buying emporium in downtown Madrid by criminals posing as living statues with a critical assist provided by a ten year old accomplice, one of the wildest film heist scenes I've ever seen and worth the price of admission alone. Seriously, you'll never forget the sight of a gold painted Jesus sprinting for his life while toting a little kid who's shooting back two handed at the police.A beginning like that would be hard to surpass, but W&B continues to pile it on under Alex de la Iglesia's masterful direction. Having commandeered a cab whose driver willingly agrees to assist them, the criminals try to flee north to France to escape the law and to fulfill the promise made by the leader, José (Hugo Silva), to take his son to Disneyworld in Paris, with the police and José's divorced wife in hot pursuit. Already a tense situation for the hapless thieves, things take a decided turn for the weird and the worse when they reach the witch infested town of Zugarramurdi, in the heart of Basque country. Led by a three generation family (the oldest witch reminded me of Grandmama from the Addams Family), the witches capture the thieves with malign designs upon them, namely to use the men as sacrifices to restore an oppressive matriarchy.The pace rarely lets up and the jokes fly fast and furious, interspersed with over the top, gross out scenes of gore. The men lament their inability to get along with women only to find themselves trapped in a decaying mansion (is there any other kind in a horror movie?) by a bunch of smiling, evil, literal witches who want to torture, kill, and eat them. They fight back as best they can, but their fates ultimately depend upon the attraction felt by the youngest witch in the family (well played by the stunningly beautiful Carolina Bang) for bumbling José. The climactic scene of a Witches' Sabbath simply has to be seen to be believed, but I won't give away any spoilers.About the only real criticism I have of this film is the English title, which I don't think accurately conveys what the film's about. The Spanish title, Las Brujas De Zugarramurdi, The Witches Of Zugarramurdi, was apparently a non-starter due to the long, difficult Basque place name. This minor cavil aside, this was a crackerjack movie, absolutely entertaining from start to finish.I recommend this film to horror fans who don't mind comedy mixed in with the scares (some horror fans are big purists that way) and anybody who likes a good laugh in general, although I will provide the trigger warning that this is not for anyone with a weak stomach.",positive
Grandma,"This is a small movie, not quite even 75 minutes long. All the characters are angry and upset the whole time. It really isn't entertaining, as far as we are concerned. Had we known more of what it was about we would not have watched it. Lily Tomlin is Elle, a 70-something lesbian whose partner had died fairly recently. When she was young, before she acknowledged her lesbianism she got pregnant, married a guy, and had a daughter. The daughter in turn had a daughter, Elle's granddaughter.That girl, 20-ish Julia Garner as Sage, is the granddaughter, a mixed up high school student. She has come to Elle this day because she needs $630 for an abortion. It is morning and she has an appointment for 5:45PM. So most of the movie is Elle and Sage interacting with various people, the boyfriend, the mother, and old friend, all to try to raise the money because Sage is broke and Elle decided to pay off all her debts and cut up her credit cards and she too is broke. The story isn't particular interesting, and the script isn't particularly well written. Basically it is a bit more than an hour of Lily Tomlin's antics and for someone who likes that then it is worthwhile. My wife and I didn't find it particularly worthwhile. When it was over we were like ""So what? These are miserable people.""",negative
Grandma,"I thought it was a great film, very enjoyable as a girl and her grandma search for the money so that she can get an abortion.The whole thing felt like it was two joints away from Being a stoner comedy, especially from the perspective of Lilly Tomilin's performance in it as the eccentric grandma with some serious baggage of her own who wishes to help her granddaughter, and on the this journey they take together the granddaughter learns a lot about her grandmother without coming all out to reveal anything. Lilly Tomilin takes first billing on the poster even though it seems like Julia Garner's character is really the center of attention as she explores Grandma's universe.I Like Sam Elliot's role in the movie as well. Maybe he was just that charming, like he was supporting Blythe Danner in I'll See You in My Dreams or I feel for the character he plays, the one time love interest of Grandma before she came out of the closet. Either way it works.It's an amusing story about family coming together when one is in need. We all should be lucky to be able to relate to what's going on. It's also about it never being too late to come though for those you love.Very humorous.",positive
When Harry Met Sejal,"I watched the movie with my wife yesterday and it started randomly with Shahrukh trying to over act tourist guide life. Suddenly he meets one more dumbo ""Sejal"" who leaves her fiancé to find some ring and travels all around Europe with reluctant Shahrukh. Finally they fall in love. Seriously thats the gist and including this it has over acting of shahrukh , Dumbness of Anushka, Silly Jokes.What were you thinking about it Mr Imtiaz Ali.. This movie should be banned from theatres as it is having lots of negative Effect of human Values and thoughts.. In fact this has actually caused me overnight headache . Probably this movie should come with a complimentary DISPRIN and psychologist appointments.If this movie is Love Story in your definition, then probably go back to 90's and start over. Shahrukh Khan - Please STOP here. I have loved your movies in 90's , but now its not selling. I bet even you would not watch this for 2:30 mins..",negative
When Harry Met Sejal,"What happened to Shahrukh from Chak De India and Swadesh? That Shahrukh who used to do good movies like that and now he keeps churning out bad movies back to back. Can anyone call that old Shahrukh and send this new Shahrukh to whatever hellhole he came from!? This movie is no different from his earlier movies he has done before, it's not even an original movie but a copy of Hollywood romantic classic ""When Harry met Sally"". They will tell you it's different..yeah, right! If Shahrukh is not going to do a original movie and copy-paste some movie and then at least do it properly...you had one job for god sake!!!Shakrukh is 51 years old but still he is doing romantic movies, he should start doing movies which suits his age. In this movie, he is playing a lover boy who is in his 20s-30s. He looks more like a grandfather of Anushka than her love interest. Shahrukh did an overacting as usual, just horrible horrible like he is suffering from seizure which is coming every one minute. If that's not his acting and that's how he has became in real life, then he should check those seizures out from a doctor, my sympathy for him and although, sometimes Anushka does an amazing job but in this, she has those expressions in her face which makes me want to punch her. I think that has to do with her botched lip surgery, that's why she can't emote and speak properly. While they travels the world together in this movie, they should go to a doctor together too.What to say about this movie? Nothing new, just another one where boy meet girl, girl meet boy and then they eventually fall in love with each other like we haven't seen clichés like this which has been rehashed like 5677234556 times. The movie was so awful that I should be given some kind of award for managed to sit throughout the end. Firstly I don't find the story enjoyable. To make a whole film about two people meeting through various stages of their lives and slowly, or should I say very slowly, starting a relationship is boring. Secondly I did not find anything funny. I was looking for some laughs, but it turned to be a total dud, like it's trying too hard to be funny. I could not focus on the film and whatever story there was in it, because dialogues were mostly forced and unnecessarily long. Maybe this is poor writing, maybe poor editing, but in any case, it resulted in a film that is hard to watch. What happened to the directer like Imtiaz Ali like his mind was too distracted while making this movie.You will only like this movie if you are too blinded by love for Shahrukh that you refuse to see any fault in his movie. They won't even agree with my review too like I'm not allowed to give an constructive criticism like you can see how they are giving this movie 9-10. I bet most of them haven't even seen the movie. Then again, it's the case with most of the Shahrukh movies where fake up voting is necessary so that general public can't see how piece of crap his movies are actually are. So watch this movie if you're a Shahrukh fan and if you are neutral like I am, then prepare to be disappointed AGAIN!!!!!",positive
Happy New Year,"I had expected a lot from this movie due to the cast it had and the publicity they did, but I had wasted my money, time and mind when I watched the movie. This movie has awful story. Comedy in the movie is nice. The vfx of the movie were nice, but the story could be made awesome, just due to story I gave the movie just one rating. I was not having a vehicle with me, I went with my family and I had to stay even after intermission. It is a hit just because of the cast and comedy ONLY. I actually had an headache after watching the movie. I don't know where is the old Sharukh who had made hits like Swades, Chak de India etc, where ever he is, I hope he comes back soon. I miss you SRK. :(",negative
Happy New Year,"What has happened to Bollywood? Directors such as Farah Khan bank on the star power of SRK/Deepika and other stars to earn rs300cr+ at the BO and what they deliver in return is a shitty/crappy/non sense/unfunny movie filled with slapstick humor, gay jokes, mediocre acting, ABS, and no logic whatsoever. I love to watch movie and I am myself a great fan of Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Manmohan Desai, their movies may not be completely logical but were entertaining and had emotions. But the joke is current directors are making high budget crappy movies with bland humor mentioning that its an inspiration to iconic directors of the past and making loads of money at the BO. I am sure HNY will be the highest grossing movie ever and Farah Khan will be one of the best director in Bollywood history, but me as an audience is left completely disappointed and cheated. HNY is the best heist movie ever since it is going the rob the Indian audience of their hard earned money in the name of entertainment.",positive
One Chance,"Starting with the movie synopsis, he was NEVER an opera singer 'by night' throughout the entire movie, and only sang for an operatic company near the end of the film when even then he only sang in the beginning of Aida until he went unconscious due to his stupidity which he demonstrates throughout the movie. It is disrespectful to those of us who have struggled against the odds to become something we truly wanted to be by implying he did the same. The only reason he even entered the contest at the end was because his wife was at her wits end with his lack of motivation to sing, although the movie does make it clear that he was well motivated to eat. Ironically, it is implied that his obesity was the main reason he was harassed while growing up, and only those who feel pity for him because of this would see some kind of justification for his eventual success in spite of his gullet.",negative
One Chance,"I saw the film One Chance prior to it's official USA opening, at the Aspen Film Festival, where it received enthusiastic applause and cheering from the audience. Although I am a long-time fan of its subject, British operatic tenor Paul Potts, it is not just ""good if you like Paul Potts"" but really, really good for anyone. Tony-award winner James Corden is excellent as Paul Potts, as is the rest of the cast, and the film is a first-class production all round. It is heartwarming and inspirational--and humorous--as it tells the story of a man who was born with an immense talent but bullied all his life for being ""different."" It is full of gorgeous music and full of romance as it follows the story of Paul and his wife, through difficulties--almost unbelievable, except it's true--that almost forced him to give up his dream, until it all came down to just One Chance to make his dreams come true. I would give it more than ""two thumbs up"" if I had more thumbs!",positive
Syrup,"I haven't read the book, but reading the comments it would appear as though its fairly different so I don't think this matters much as far as a review of the film is concerned.The main thing that distracted me through the whole movie was the casting of Shiloh Fernandez as Scat, other than maybe having the look of a sleazy marketer, he seemed massively out of place as a male lead. I didn't think there was any chemistry between him and Amber Heard at all, any attraction between the two seemed totally implausible. He'd probably be fine in a supporting role, but not as a lead. I was wondering the whole time if his father financed the movie or something to get him the role.Other than that the movie was OK, it did seem to be trying to hard to be cool and edgy and didn't really pull it off. Sure it had a tiny budget, but if anything doing things on a shoe string should make a movie more cool and edgy, but it wasn't at all. Everything that was meant to be cool seemed forced and cliché.On the positive side, I thought Amber Heard was great as 6, as was her character. I can see why the ending left a few unhappy, but I think it was better to do what they did than just some by the numbers rom-com ending.",negative
Syrup,"This movie is nowhere near as clever as it believes it is. It is hip to a certain extent, but they overdo it in a big way. Marketing energy drinks with names like ""Fukk"" is clever and funny at first, especially with all that jokes that come along with it, but it gets stagnant rather quickly. There is plenty of stereotyping and sexism as well, along with breaking the fourth wall with some admittedly clever inner monologue. The story isn't strong enough, so they try to be as cool as possible. The first half isn't half-bad. It's cool, sharp, and even clever at certain points. I was kind of digging it to a certain extent. Sadly, it runs out of fuel in the second half, and turns into a mortality tale that is filled with ethics. It becomes overly serious, and it turned me off to be honest. It doesn't help that our two leads are as selfish as can possibly be. As sexy and fun as Amber Heard is, the ""enigmatic"" character of hers got on my nerves. I was able to put up with it, because Amber is so gorgeous, but her character is needlessly childish. Heard manages to overcome it all with sheer talent, and her galvanizing presence, but her character does her no favors. She didn't feel like a human being at all. Shiloh Fernandez is a tad on the blind side. His smug performance wasn't exactly endearing. His character angered me. He's a bit of a slacker, and manages to achieve success. It sent the wrong message in my opinion. His chemistry with Heard wasn't that great. Brittany Snow is always a welcome presence, but her cameo felt out of place and otiose. The worst thing about this movie might just be the ending. It tries to distinguish itself from fantasy and reality, and I didn't buy it. Overall, this movie was cold. I was left wondering what the point of it was. Everything about this movie is cold. I didn't care for it at all. It never bored me, but more substance was needed. It's just too unlikable and crass for it's own good 4.7/10",positive
Cinayet Süsü,Storytelling is really bad and its like the most booring movie ive ever seen dont watch it it is not worth you time.,negative
Cinayet Süsü,I have seen like really serious comments for this really funny movie. Guys please calm down and chill. It's as you can see just a comedy. Do comedies always follow the real life and perfect mentality? I don't think so. I love it especially Cengiz Bozkurt is -in a word l-amazing. I cried when I was laughing. Soundtrack also amazing! Go on Ali Atay and every single person who support or contribute this. I might be a little bit emotional because of this negative comments but only reason is I really like this movie and couldn't believe all those comments,positive
Hichki,"Main female lead is born with a condition which forces her to hiccup or stammer or something between both. There is not any strong reason for her desperate desire to be a teacher while she is easily offered job in a bank. Her hiccups are plain annoying and clearly not fit for any profession where good speaking would be must. An upper class English medium school is not ready to accept slum kids, who are pushed over to them by Government, due to right to education act to study. Characterization of these kids are so cheesy, like they have shown in there very first scene, as drinking country liquor, smoking, gambling with playing card in school, because they belong to slum!? Then why they are not stopping to go to school is not clear, even how did they reach ninth standard when they were not a bit interested in study!? Why did school administration not rusticate them in beginning even being aware of their budding criminal like activities in school, when they could have do so as they decide to do in pre climax!? It seems that only a single teacher is taking class of all subjects of ninth standard!? If you are unable to understand science and math of ninth standard then you won't get the point of few scenes. Performance wise Rani Mukherjee is sincere, looks beautiful but fails to impress except in the scene where she breaks down. Harsh Mayer, who played student Atish, performed like a seasoned actor. Shivkumar Subramanium as Pricipal is very good. Neeraj Kabi as antagonist teacher is first rate. Title track music is so soothing and melodious.",negative
Hichki,"Hichki - 10/10 . Must Watch.I went to the movie theater after going through multiple mixed reviews from the so-called movie critics. 
For those who have seen the trailer, this will be nothing new
Plot: The main protagonist Naina Mathur has Tourette's syndrome who desperately wants to be a teacher. Even after multiple rejections, her decision to take up teaching as a profession remains firm. Finally, she gets offered, a job @ St.Nautkers but her class of 14 is full of rebels. We get glimpses of her childhood, as to how irritating it must have been to have been misunderstood and made fun of. She even shares an estranged relationship with her father. So basically, how she deals with all these hichkis is the story all about.Its a very simple plot of underdog meets underdogs and how they excel, but to make such a predictable plot interesting and watchable is where lies the craft of cinema. The direction, screenplay, cinematography, casting all in all was top notch. From the word go the movie started connecting. Everything was expressed in a subtle way. Nothing was over the top. There were many tear-jerking moments in the movie. There was never a dull moment. Every single character was bang on.Coming to performance, the 14 slum students(especially Aatish) were so good at their respective roles. Niraj Kabi as the other teacher was top notch, his transition in body language and dialogue delivery towards the end spoke leaps and bounds about how seasoned an actor he was. Sachin and Supriya as Naina's parents were apt. For obvious reasons, the belongs to Rani Mukerji. Rani as Naina Mathur is brilliant. She has given an outstanding performance which will guide many upcoming actors.No words to express my thoughts about how good an actor she is.As a die-hard Rani fan, I was nervous. I was just happy seeing her after 4 long years on the silver screen. Had no big expectation from the movie. But oh boy was I taken aback. The movie was something else. It was class apart.It was just awesome. It had the right pinch of ingredients.The main thing about the movie is that there is nothing forced, The music is not loud to drive you emotionally. You are at your own free will. It doesn't try to influence you. 
The teacher-student relationship has been portrayed so well. A student will be fortunate to have a Naina Mathur teach them. Everything was intact. You will start reminiscing. It for sure will be a nostalgic experience for many. For the 1st time in my life, I clapped once the movie got over. That was the impact it had on me.One piece of advice to all the people out here, please comment after watching a movie. Don't mislead people with your prejudice. This movie deserves to be a hit. Only then more of such will be made. All we get to see is stupid masala flicks crossing 100 crores with ease. But movies like Hichki in spite of having a very strong content end up doing an average business, one main reason, without doubt, it has a female protagonist. Come on guys times are changing. Appreciate movie's content. Every teacher/student/parent should watch the movie. Hoping for the movie to do good business. All the best to the team of Hichki.",positive

Mood Indigo,"It's been a long time since I've been acquainted with Michel Gondry. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Science of Sleep are two of my all-time favourite films. Be Kind Rewind was an unfortunate misfire but I already warmly welcome his style. However, I've never seen him quite so unrestrained like this. Mood Indigo is a truly fantasy world. No dream, no drugs, and nothing is how you'd expect. Not even dancing, not even a handshake. To say the world of Mood Indigo is surreal and absurd is an understatement and no words can quite grasp the chaos on screen. It's like an R-rated Dr. Seuss. Like Gilliam's Brazil. But, it's an absolute delight. Things may not make sense at any point, but it's not about symbolism, it's about expressionism. The characters are deeply human, and that's what counts. All these inventions, twists, obscurities all about emotion. And Mood Indigo constantly had me bellying with laughter or sinking an anchor in my stomach when tragedy strikes even when I wasn't sure what was happening.That's the spirit of filmmaking really, to feel how the characters are feeling, and this film achieves it admirably. But at times it is so dense that its hard to keep up. The special effects and production design are wonderful, but the way it's shot in HD does sometimes nullify its effects and brings us back to reality in a way it doesn't want (I would've preferred Gondry to not have his cameo). Sometimes the cast can't even keep up with it. I really wasn't sure about the cast at first. They're familiar faces, but they didn't seem to suit the tone, plus they felt too old. However, with the film's dark twist in the second half, so dark the film turns black and white, it did become apparent that these cast members fit this melancholic side of the world. I wish it wasn't so bloated in characters and was more restrained like The Science of Sleep. The great soundtrack definitely adds to its rich atmosphere too. I do hope this film will stick with me like his two best films. It may be manic, but it's thoroughly charming. Not Gondry's best but his best in a long while.8/10",negative
Mood Indigo,"When I decided to go see that movie, I was really scared. Scared that, somehow, this movie might be bad, whereas the book of Boris Vian is one of my favorite. But when I got out, I was really amazed. I felt almost depressed, exactly the same way when I finished reading the book. For the whole night long, I couldn't keep my mind of the movie, and I was barely able to sleep. Gondry actually made me open my eyes about some things, that I couldn't imagine or figure out. But when I think about it, it just make sense. Like the fact that Alise is black woman. I don't know why, I've always imagined her as a white and blonde woman. But it's only natural that she is in fact black.I can understand the fact that some people would not like the movie, being very weird, and being in it's own universe. But I really think this movie deserves a way better grade. Maybe one of the greatest adaptations that I have seen, yet. I gladly recommend to see this movie.",positive
Pawn Shop Chronicles,"Hadn't heard anything about this movie, or even known of its existence, until about an hour before I watched it tonight, lol. First off, for all you Norman Reedus fans: Even though he gets near top billing, You never see his face, and his screen time is like 2 minutes, so calm down for thinking you found a new Reedus film to be excited about, lol. (Don't you hate it when they do that :o/) This film's a good example of that scenario where the concept or premise of the film, its preview, and poster, make the film look really good, only to have the execution and/or the end of the film fall flat. High quality acting performances were given by the entire all star cast, Brandon Frasier especially, impressive as a lost, struggling, Elvis impersonator. There were some good, entertaining moments in the movie that gave me hope, but that's as far as it got. For every moment it seems like it was going to recover, it would fall again, including the ending, which was a let down, and, honestly, even for a movie of this genre, I felt the ending was in bad taste and crossed a line, as they tried to make humor of a man keeping women in captivity. VERY BAD timing, after what just went down in Ohio. You know how a movie can be so weird, but in a good way, or so weird in a bad way ? Well for me, this had both, but in the end, just left me feeling in a bad way. But, I say ""for me"", and rate this in the middle because, I'm sure there's going to be some of you sick pups out there that's going to think it was hilarious, while others will think it's just plain weird, in a bad way. 2.5 out of 5, or 5 out of 10 IMDb stars.",negative
Pawn Shop Chronicles,"Just discovered this movie and decided to watch as it is listed as a 'comedy'. And a very dark comedy it is! There are some really disturbingly funny scenes, but I found the balance of the film to be a sarcastically allegorical comment on life in America. Why the previous reviewers missed this is a surprise! Throughout the entire story director Wayne Kramer has offered to the viewer symbolic remarks on religion, politics, and economic life in the American laboring society.First we see the pawn shop - in America everything is a commodity that can be sold and bought - nothing has real value and value is always marginalized when the seller is in 'need'.Second Kramer offers the three rednecks who, on the surface are religious, in symbols only, and have no idea why 'they believe' because they are too consumed with destructive self indulgence. Then when Vernon is left for dead a 'savior' appears not to save him but to offer the chance for revenge. In America it's just believing that makes religion true, not understanding and living it.Third Richard discovers 'the ring' in the pawn shop and seeks answers as to how it got there. Kramer again shows us how property is valued in the social order. Material things along with humans are gifts for capitalist overlords. Shaw represents the ownership society. And when they offer favors to the 'working class' they are to be obedient and grateful, as seen with the caged women for Shaw's pleasure and the 'number one' caged girl who refuses to leave because she gets 30 minutes of television a week in 'the house'. Richard is the liberator and freedom fighter that American's always reject and destroy.Fourth Kramer gives us Ricky, the fourth rate Elvis impersonator, and here Kramer sums up the movie. Americans want to be 'a star' but few have that kind of talent outside of being a big fish in a small pond. And thats where Ricky finds himself. His image is compelling to the locals in that unnamed small southern town and they willing follow him around! Ricky wants a barber to even his sideburns and must choose between two identical barber shops. Kramer smartly symbolizes the American political system here as there is no real difference between the two leading parties (Democrats & Republicans). But the locals think there is a difference between the two barber shops and when Ricky picks one over the other mayhem erupts in the street. In America perception is what drives the choices. When the choice really doesn't exist! When Ricky gets to perform at the carnival he is so unprepared and untalented the locals reject him. Then when he accepts the offer made by the street preacher (Mephistopheles type character), Ricky's whole image changes when he starts singing 'Amazing Grace'. Suddenly the local towns folk see him as bright and talented because he has accepted their Christian values. Then the naked and filth covered cage women show up and wrap themselves in the American flag. The image of justice and freedom shine as long as Americans have patriotism and God. Shaw returns from the dead to claim the filth covered women and a new woman. They all follow him out. The locals are too star struck to notice what's happening right before them. Kramer shows how Americans cannot escape the capitalist system (Shaw) because society will always give into religion, patriotism and those who control the money.The film closes with Harry (little man/big truck) entering the pawn shop to teach Alton a lesson but JJ quells him easily and then it's business as usual for Alton. Harry is the collective conscience of America and it's small and easy to overlook, but it's always there.Pawn Shop Chronicles is a triumph for Kramer - it's perfection start to finish!",positive
The Road Within,"I saw Dev Patel was in this and willing to take a shot at this straight-to-video title. What a mistake. The portrayal of someone with Tourette's syndrome was portrayed more like a caricature rather than a character. The other actors were also bafoonish. Really terrible direction, especially considering there were several very capable actors in this. What a waste. The writing was excrutiatingly dull and derivitive. Don't waste your time on this one, there are so many better made, more entertaining comedy/drama's out there.",negative
The Road Within,"Wow! I laughed, cried, throughout this movie. I was amazed to find out that this was a directorial debut for director/writer Gren Wells. If you love falling in love with characters as they head on their journey, this movie is for you! Through the seriousness of the disorders this movie takes on (which, by the way, were beautifully portrayed by Kravitz, Patel and Sheehan) I was able to feel with them, laugh with them, and cry with them. The Tourette's Syndrome, OCD, and Anorexia that they took hold of was captivating. I could tell that a whole lot of thought was put into researching Tourette's by Gren Wells and Robert Sheehan because they gave us just enough of Tourette's. It would have been extremely easy to portray too much of ticks and mannerisms and make him look silly, but fortunately his interpretation was sincere and gave us just enough. I applaud him and the whole cast for the care they took with their characters and their corresponding illnesses. I would call this film 'careful' in the greatest way. It is extraordinary to find a director paired with an outstanding cast that take great care in their art. I loved it!",positive
A Case of You,"Chose to watch this one night when I couldn't decide what to watch and needed something quite easy. Well.. I was pleasantly surprised. This film which pitches itself as a romantic comedy actually had a bit of hidden depth in the shape of its protagonist and his issues around relationships, no doubt related to his relationship with his mum. It sounds quite serious but is quite funny really. The starry cameos, including Peter Dinklage as a camp Barista, and Sam Rockwell as a hippie guitar teacher all add to a general quirky humour. Its not amazing by any standard but if you fancy a romance which is entertaining, amusing but makes you think a little I'd recommend you give it a whirl!",negative
A Case of You,"I'll admit right up front I quit watching after an hour, not because it was bad but because it was nothing new. If you're unfamiliar with the ""manic pixie"" story, think of Natalie Portman in ""Garden State"" or Zooey Deschanel in everything she's ever done. Or if you want to get right down to it, there's the original and greatest manic pixie that ever was: Audrey Hepburn. The formula is you take 1 lovable loser guy, usually stiff, awkward or outright lame, and you pair him with a girl who is hazardously spontaneous and carefree as if she's still suffering the effects of novacaine from the dentist an hour earlier. Personally I love these kinds of films, but I love them because it's interesting to see the unique angle each one offers. But here in ""A Case of You"" there is no angle.So what we get are endless scenes of the guy making a fool out of himself and the girl pirouetting through the scenes not noticing. There's a very weak, contrived ""conflict"" (the guy is facebook stalking her), but I don't have to watch the last 20 minutes to guess exactly how it ends. I'm guessing: revelation, confrontation, reconciliation. It's the standard formula just like the rest of the story was up to the point I turned it off.You might enjoy this movie if you're not familiar with the manic pixie formula, but if you are, then watching this flick is sort of like reading a teen vampire book. You know exactly how it's going to go but you read it anyway because War & Peace gives you a headache.Where this movie fails, beyond simply being a lukewarm copy of all the others, is that there is nothing quirky about the manic pixie (Evan Rachel Wood). There is no depth, no bizarre secret past, no soul. For example, in the excellent ""Garden State"" we get Natalie Portman who is a manic pixie on the surface but we soon learn that she suffers from a spectrum of problematic mental issues like pathological lying. It gives her character complexity and makes her interesting to us. Similarly if we look at Audrey Hepburn's manic pixie (take ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"") we get the same superficial happy-go-lucky exterior but we are fully aware that she is more or less a prostitute. Again, tremendous complexity to an otherwise predictable character.But here in ""A Case for You"" there is absolutely no complexity. There is nothing out of the ordinary about either of the two, except that he's an awkward loser and she's a social butterfly.I do give it points for some excellent (yet all too brief) cameos by Sam Rockwell as a hilariously egotistical guitar teacher, Peter Dinklage as a riotously funny coffee shop barista, and Vince Vaughn as a fast talking corporate suit who ought to have a Bluetooth headset surgically attached to his head. These scenes absolutely carried the film, but ultimately the story itself gives us nothing new.Instead of this I would recommend any of the others I mentioned, as well as an unknown Japanese gem ""Shiki-Jitsu"" (Ritual) written by, and starring, Ayako Fujitani who is Steven Seagal's daughter (NO RESEMBLANCE!).",positive
Karwaan,"What is a road movie if it has not chafe the topic of self-discovery? Karwaan is thankfully not devoid of the usual ingredients plus some more eccentricities developed by its formula characters. Which at the end does not help it stand out from all the other road movies we have seen before.Writer Bejoy Nambiar's cliched story is a straightforward setup of a drained and unenthusiastic software engineer Avinash (Dulquer Salmaan) trying to retrieve his late father's body from Coimbatore. Helping him in this 'endeavor', as per director Akarsh Khurana, is a mysterious and over-zealous mechanic friend Shaukat (Irrfan) who seems to be a walking book of jokes and contrived thoughts that look like they were also borrowed from the elastic Internet and a ridiculously similar recent Bollywood film, Tanuja Chandra's Qarib Qarib Singlle (2018). Together they follow Khurana and scenarist Adhir Bhat's storyboard to an eventful journey from Bangalore while meeting at least three new people that would change their lives. That Mithila Palkar plays (Tanya) one of these people not only adds to the annoyance in the experience but also completes Karwaan as a rehash of all road films.Whether it is Avinash who shows no remorse at his father's death or about the body mix-up or Tanya who is that spoiled brat with Himalayan proportions of angst inside her just because she had to deal with a death when she was eight, Karwaan has a reason for everything. It tries to justify its characters' actions using random story arcs that are emotional, but downright ridiculous. Death seems to be an easy subject for each and every character in Karwaan until it suddenly isn't. Forget about the transition, the characters fail to emphasize this development as we see the film take a turn at the eleventh minute just to show that ""different people grieve differently"". I am all in for eccentric road trips but there has to be honesty in the storytelling when you are trying to convey a message, even if it means trading with sassy humor. Karwaan lacks that honesty.The narrative gets a flat tire when it extends to a territory that would have reduced the running time by 30 minutes. But then how would they demystify Shuakat's story and add more to the sassy humor. There is a clear attempt at projecting this entire thing as a bittersweet story about life and death, yet the contrived nature plays spoilsport with it. The bending of the genre is appreciative, and I am more than happy with Hussain Dalal's funny dialogues and their timing, but none of that would help salvage the car heading towards an accident because of the flat tire that they fail to mend.Salmaan manages to portray his character like the decrepit van used in the film. It works and is perfect for the use, but it still has some problems. His Hindi dialogues are a bit rusty (but Avinash's a native of Bangalore, mind you) but his expressions and acting, in general, make up for it. His deep voice adds to his character, which is why I would say that his casting was one of the best decisions the makers made for the film. The same isn't true for Irrfan who is typecast and made to look like a fool in the name of comedy. His actions surely will tickle your bones and make you chuckle for about three seconds. You will soon realize that this comedy is the only saving grace of the movie, and the character who delivers it is annoying to the core. But Palkar wins that throne as her teenage character successfully captures the millennial vibe, using Snapchat and Instagram to chronicle the trip, testing if she's preggers just to add that ""you know what' to the story, and having no regard to her mum or anyone in her life to showcase the ""cool teenager of the 21st century"". She is incredible, but her character is again a piece of cliched cake that Khurana seems to be a master baker of. I'm only happier that she didn't pull off a Kiki challenge using the symbolic van. That would have given the writers one more joke for Shuakat to crack. Sad.The lead protagonist's anger towards his job and the IT sector, in general, is loud and clear in Khurana's screenplay, and I have all the reasons to believe that Khurana knows someone who or was himself laid off by an IT company. Not taking names, but this type of stereotyping is all over the place in his Karwaan. From Shaukat's vindictive dialogues about partition and the British Raj to two unsuspecting foreigners (who may not even be English), again his condescending ways against two hippies from Europe, and his overall decipherment of people in large highlights and shamelessly supports the dogma that the world has been trying to eradicate. I cannot support entertainment of that kind even if it means in a light heart. I wonder if the CBFC only cares about sex and Kashmir.Moreover, for the entire running time of the film, I even believed that Irrfan had just moved out from the sets of the Tanuja Chandra film and stepped into Khurana's without even changing his attire. Such is the similarity between the characters, whose life philosophy seems to be originating from the same source. The other two characters use each other as sources and thereby discover themselves. The soothing soundtrack is supportive of the nature of the film but they will be forgotten before you move out of the hall. But what WILL stay with you instead is the logistical issues in the film. As a pedant, I was wondering how these people were transporting a dead body inside an aluminium box for days and without even once mentioning anything about a stench. Of course, Tanya once points out the decomposition factor, but a little more info would not have made me accuse Khurana of letting easy, small holes into his plot.Karwaan plays out like a fairytale of sorts where the forgiving characters go about on a journey that does not disclose any logistical parameters neither sheds light into what matters. It dances on the periphery and strives to add comedy to everything, even death, which is counter-productive to what it sets out to be. The performance, comedy, and the overall positive vibe earn it four stars, but as a road movie, it still is a middle-bencher. TN.",negative
Karwaan,"It is like a never ending road trip flim. I just loved it. The movie takes various turns as it goes on . As the movie goes on you will enjoy it a double . 
If we come to acting then the only person has done a fabulous job is irrfan khan, only because of his role the movie didn't got boring. Dulquer saalman has also done a great job . Mithila palkar as it was her debut , she was just , not bad but good. Please watch this film you will love it a lot .",positive
Fading Gigolo,"Quirky stuff here!! If you like oddball, this movie could appeal to you.Well-written and great musical accompaniment. John Turtorro does a Woody Allen – and does it well! It's a great assortment of extreme characters – particularly the women, from Sharon Stone and Sofia Vergara who play unrepressed hotties - to Vanessa Paradis who plays a repressed Hasidic Jewish woman. So there is a lot going on – and it definitely gets your attention. And it's never predictable! And really I don't quite know the point of the film – religion represses women could be one. Be prepared there are a lot of surprising antics!",negative
Fading Gigolo,"Here is a film that is pleasantly unique and special. A film that is a bit different, probably my own misunderstanding, than advertised from the trailers. It's not a bad thing, the trailers brought me to the film, and the film kept my curiosity for the entire length. I liked it quite a bit unsurprising to you dear reader, as you've already seen my rating. The film was written & directed by it's main star, John Turturro, and what a grand achievement it is. Also starring in supporting roles and fantastic to say the least; Sharon Stone, Sofia Vergara, Liev Schreiber, Vanessa Paradis, and New York's own, film legend Woody Allen. I found while watching this film, and though the characters played by Turturro & Allen were enjoyable to watch, I was fascinated mostly with Paradis' character and her story. I'm not Jewish myself, so I'm very naive to the culture and their religious practices, and found it a interesting insight to a, I'm sure, small portion of what it may be like to be of Jewish faith. Though, and I said I was naive to the culture, it may not be entirely true. With that said, I found a film that surprised me positively and thus was quite better than I expected.",positive
Don't Think Twice,"""I think for anyone - male or female - in improv, the biggest thing to get over is the fear. I think every improviser has that."" Rachel DratchDon't Think Twice makes you think more than once about not just the enormous demands of comedy, including fear of failure, but also about doing anything for a profession that may give you little to no compensation other than the joy of doing what you love and are good at.More than anything else, this comedy makes a poignant comment on the irony of talented people making it while other talents struggle never to be recognized. Miles (writer-director Mile Birbiglia) feels it painfully as he sees Jack (Keegan-Michael Key) win a spot on Weekend Live (no doubt, Saturday Night Live) while Miles and his other colleagues labor in the lesser venue of NYC on the improv team, The Commune.As the title of their improv group suggests, their work is communal, depending on an effort for which individual spotlights have no place. Ironically, Jack wins the Weekend Live job partially by standing out doing a solo routine even though his colleagues warned him against it.Don't Think Twice does an effective job of showing the inherent contradictions of communal support and individual talent. In the matter of a romance between Jack and Sam (Gillian Jacobs), the tensions between their emerging rewards for their talent and sacrifice are subtly displayed in their loving routines and their personal love.You would not be surprised to know how difficult it would be to determine which bits in the movie are improv and which are rehearsed, so good are the performers. Even that puzzle supports a theme about the intersection of reality and artifice, a benign clash between the creative improvisation and the spontaneity of life itself. Both bring their rewards and disappointments.Here is a comedy with touches of real life--hey, I think that's what life itself is all about.",negative
Don't Think Twice,"I don't think all movies should appeal to all audiences (you cannot be everything to everybody), and my guess is this film is like an ""acid test"" for creative people. If you are not of the creative-artistic type, the movie will probably say nothing to you. However, if you do belong to that group, you'll relate to a lot of what happens to the characters in the movie, and won't get enough of it; at least that's what happened to me.Personally, some of the situations and questions discussed in the movie that I've faced myself as a member of the aforementioned group are: * Should I water down my production, in order to end the struggle of paying the rent of every month? * When you're in your 20s, there's something romantic about living like a band of gypsies, but as time goes by and everything takes more effort... where do you draw the line? * Seeing plagiarized something you never cared to protect in the first place, because you thought there was an understanding * Chickening out in the last moment from some ""big opportunity"" only because your gut feeling tells you that something's not right * Inspiration (the masterpiece that will come whenever) vs consistency (the product that, good or bad, you have to put at the door every week, following certain parameters, and nobody cares if your dad died yesterday) * That idea you have in your head and never get around to putting in paper * That work you've put in paper but never get around to submitting to other people's critique (because it's your baby) * Soul-drying day job vs still being financed by your parents at an embarrassing age The movie, like any good movie, does not provide a single answer to these questions, but each character's individual answer. Someone said in other comment that there is no character development, and I disagree; definitely all the characters end up in a different place to where they started, with lessons learned about the world, the others, and themselves.There is a small scene that resonates a lot with me; when the protagonists meet Ben Stiller and they are kind of starstruck and overwhelming him with questions, Bill congratulates him for a Herman Monster sketch he wrote, and Stiller mumbles ""that was a long time ago..."". Here is the ambivalence: saying that something happened ""a long time ago"" is a bad thing in entertainment (it means you're yesterday's news), but a good thing in art (it means you've created a piece that people can revisit time after time through the years with affection). That tension is present in the whole film: are we just the court's jester, or is there something more important in stake here? The writing of the script is very subtle, it keeps growing on you after watching it (again, if this is your kind of film). Even the characters that appear only once or twice have a lot to them, amazing tips of the iceberg.The choice of improvisation theater as the artistic discipline is also very wise; in all forms of art you are to some degree ""putting yourself out there"", but in improvisation that's perhaps more literal than in any other genre. You may have trained a lot but, when the moment comes, the piece of art is yourself, no safety net there...The actors are all great, good casting and superb interpretations. Keegan-Michael Key is great in his role as, together with Stiller, the ""celebrity-who-fights-to-stay-human"". His love story with Samantha (Gillian Jacobs) is beautiful and multi-layered, there is even a short bed scene that is treated, for a change, with humor and simple kindness, so good to see after the usual ""wrestling"" that seems to be mandatory for those scenes in blockbuster films... The beautiful Gillian Jacobs can communicate a lot of emotion without using words, and she also has a knack for comedy... Mike Birbiglia is great as the slightly disenchanted leader of the group, who lives in kind of a ""time wrap"", a windowless room where he seduces his twenty something students, waiting for the next thing to happen in his career... The enigmatic Kate Micucci is perfect in her character of Allison, the delicate and insecure girl who draws her beautiful inner world, and always can use a push from her friends.I also like the character of Lindsay (Tami Sagher), perhaps the most close to ""conventional"" among the troupe, with the blessing of wealthy parents that support her economically, which is also a curse as it increases the pressure to ""make it"". And Chris Gethard is great as Bill, a reserved guy who stays true to his principles and loyal to his friends no matter what, and in whom the balance he has achieved with his dad takes a very different shape.Like I said, perhaps it's not a movie for everybody. It's an intimate kind of movie. I feel all those characters as my friends, as someone I could hang out with, but I understand that for other people, the movie can feel petty or random, like ""why should they care"". To each their own. :)",positive
I'm So Excited!,"The film begins with the line, 'Everything in this film is fiction and fantasy; any resemblance to real life is purely coincidental'. This is acclaimed Spanish director Pedro Almodovar's opening conceit, his attempt at irony, for what is undoubtedly his worst film to date. Billed as 'A feel-good celebration of human sexuality', it neither perks you up, nor entices you to pop a cork. It is devoid of wit, originality and skill. I laughed not once. I came away feeling low and full of regret. The story – if one can honestly call it that – is this. A technical fault causes an aeroplane to fly around in circles until a clear runway is found for a safe landing. Meanwhile the all-gay crew entertain the eccentric passengers – everyone from a former Dominatrix called Miss Take (hah hah), a virginal clairvoyant who claims she can smell death, a disgraced business man, a Mexican hit man and a drug mule. The crew's awful burlesque of the famous Pointer Sister song (which the film usurps for its title) – meant to be the film's pinnacle – turns out to be its nadir. But no. Lower depths are found, thanks to the stream- of-consciousness plot, which is a stream of banality and embarrassment. One of the crew has the bright idea of spiking passengers' drinks with the drug mule's mescaline pills – but not without first nosing to check how well they were smuggled.Ennui becomes too much for some who decide – I think influenced by the pills – to let carnality take over. I should have joined the elderly gentleman who left as soon as the clairvoyant did what she really ought not to have done to the sleeping man. But, like a man determined to confront a phobia, I stayed to endure the nightmare.Please do not think this is one of those so-bad-you-must-see-it films. In case my diatribe has still not convinced you to stay away, tell me if you find this funny. A steward wipes something from the lip of another steward who has just visited the bisexual pilot. Disbelieving the reason for his disappearance, he licks his finger to confirm what he thinks it is. (Let me provide a clue: it isn't milk.)Any fool knows that a joke is not always funny in another language. So, if nothing else, Almodovar proves that the worst of American humour is a whole lot worse in Spanish. Worst of all, 'I'm so Excited' manages to be something which most films, no matter how immoral or subversive, cannot be: pointless. www.moseleyb13.com",negative
I'm So Excited!,"Sadly this film didn't last long in one of the premiere venues in town and this has no doubt to do with lukewarm reviews the result I fear of critics' uptightness and pretentiousness. Personally I'm thrilled that the movie was so light on the surface (less so upon reflection) and totally put pedal to the metal for outrrrrageousness. I haven't had such a good time at a comedy in many many moons.And for what it's worth, while the caviar critic of one hugely prestigious newspaper in the US bemoans the fact that boring old Antonio Banderas had only a cameo, I was thrilled to see the back of him on account of there being a smorgasbord of hot hombres in just about every conceivable flavor - a notable garnish indeed to of the sustenance offered by ""I'm So Excited!"" Anyway I found it to be pretty much unassailable - perfect. I would even say that it's one of his best movies. Just because it's not as ""deep"" or cathartic as ""All About My Mother"" ""Live Flesh"" or ""Law of Desire"" doesn't mean it's flawed in any way. Thrilled that the man came out with something just like this at just this time to tell you the truth. And to the guy who writes something about ""it sets back the portrayal of gays by 10 years"" maybe you have a point and in this respect I am also delighted with the film!!",positive

Ölümlü Dünya,This is one of the best films of the year. I think it is a very enjoyable and traceable film for Turkish Cinema.,positive
Mucize,"First, let me list what I liked about this film. The setting is beautiful. Stark natural beauty of mountainous Eastern Turkey is breathtaking. Cinematography is also top notch. Local costumes, especially of the women are colorful, authentic and gorgeous. The subject matter, a city-bred grade school teacher is assigned to a remote mountain village where he assumes the self assigned task of rehabilitating a local spastic young man, has the potential of being developed into a powerful story. However, that is where my disappointment starts. The film blows the chance of being a masterpiece. The story development is choppy and full of unlikely events. At several points, I found myself asking 'but, why?' or 'how come?' and finding no explanation. The 'miracle' that is revealed at the end of the movie is probably the one plot element that is least believable. When the villagers wonder how the 'miracle' came about, the main character's explanation, 'I fell in love with my wife', just does not cut it. I admire the young Turkish director, Mahsun Kirmizigul, due to his productivity and improvement in his directing skills he has mustered over the years. Never the less, I believe he still has quite a distance to cover in order to perfect his artistry in story telling.",negative
Mucize,"This is my first review on IMDb. I loved many films but in no case was so motivated to write a review ! I went to ""Mucize"" (Miracle) with little bits expectations but I was truly overwhelmed with this superb story of Mahsun Kirmizigul. I can not remember another movie where I have cried more then this! It is about people who loves other people without expectations. It is about courage of a man who only wants that children go to school and therefore he moves from his city to a place what you can call ""the middle of nowhere""...It is about love what is defined as the key for reach your target...the film looks like real life. All of the characters have played very well but there is one person who have played his role SUPERB ! That is the crazy man : Aziz (Mert Turak) ! The character who plays te handicapped man with a truly amazing emotional bond with his horse. ( I have read somewhere that he has been lived 3 months with the horse to make this possible). He plays the character so perfect that I thought that he really was crazy / handicapped ! In the first half of the movie are so many good jokes that you can think it's a comedy. In the second half the film transforms in a emotional roller-coaster what's putting you in a story that is no more forgettable in your whole live ! A person, who is saying I own a heart, will cry ! There are also more Turkish films like, Eskiya (now in the top 250 of IMDb), babam ve oglum etc. what I can say they were very good but this peace of cinema from early singer Mahsun Kirmizigul is near PERFECT ! See it to believe it. 10 stars out of 10 !",positive
Comet,"One of the most pretentious movies I have ever watched. The main guy character is an unlikable, self-important asshat right from the start, in a way that should be obvious to everybody - except, apparently, the main girl character. She likes it, goes right along with his ""I'm the smartest man alive"" schtick, and delivers some crazy chick attitude in return. The writers worked hard to make narcissistic, sociopathic character traits appear quirky and cute. They're not. They're narcissistic and sociopathic. Couple that with clumsy exposition, wooden dialogue, and wannabe ""aha!"" moments, and it all turns into a major trainwreck. I'm guessing the actors did the best with what they were given to work with. However, the result should appear highly unlikable to any human being with a shred of actual empathy. Comet is a movie that looks good on paper, but unfortunately, does not deliver on its promise at all. Unless we're supposed to find these two painfully annoying, in which case, congratulations.",negative
Comet,"Hollywood movies rarely move me as the formula used is predictable, with most endings being predictable shortly into the film. If you are looking for the Americana white picket fence house in the suburbs, two kids and a dog relationship this is not for you. Comet is a statement on love between two people looking for love who have the unsocial ability to speak their mind, the truth. Truth hurts, and without the ""skills"" to cushion their raw feelings they do hurt each other. Its a beautiful refreshing approach to viewing a relationship, magically crafted by the filmmakers by interweaving the 6 year timeline of their relationship leading up to the final scenes. A film to show this narrative needed two actors who could bring the characters to life and make you believe, outstandingly accomplished by Justin Long and Emmy Rossum. Please realize most of this entire film is carried by these two actors, the supporting cast is small but excellent, the cinematography is captivatingly beautiful, and the musical score integrated perfectly, adding up to a great movie experience. I gave this film a 10, which I never do, to counterbalance the rating of people who obviously did not take the time to take this journey.

Bangalore Days,"Seriously, this movie is overrated. Nothing really happens in this movie. We've got three cousins and we're shown how they're spending their time. Each of them have got problems of their own and they try to sort it out. The acting is sub par with the only good performance done by Fahadh Faasil. Nivin pauly tries hard in comedy but does not succeed much. Dulquer tries to look menacing but does not come up to the mark. Nazriya is really bad. The story turns melodramatic and songs are there for no reason. Songs were actually good, but there is no context for these songs in the movie. And what's with putting the setting as Bangalore? Seriously, this story could've taken place in any of the cities of India. Kochi would've been fine. I won't say this is a complete failure. It is only overrated. If you have nothing else to do and is ready to see a movie which is all style and no substance, then watch this movie.",negative

A.C.O.D.,"This movie was one of those films that you just keep watching not because it's good, but because you find yourself trying to figure out the point of the story throughout its lame phases of development. Just like back in the day when American Beauty won the Oscar for best picture, or that other incredibly stupid movie Little Miss Sunshine, this is one that could be similarly categorized as unworthy of even obtaining funds for production! Extremely pointless & disappointing. Adult Children of Divorce (ACOD) should seek counseling if they are unable to re-immerse in healthy, social relationships. Additionally, while I do understand this film was labeled as a comedy and some of the actors in the movie are known to play in comedic roles, this movie was the antonym of humorous. In fact, is was absolutely painful to watch!",negative
A.C.O.D.,"A.C.O.D. is such a terrific film that it's difficult to believe that it's Zicherman's directorial debut. The screenplay, by Karlin and Zicherman, is remarkably clever and witty--combining humor with poignant insight to a very satisfying effect. Zicherman gets the pacing exactly right, showing faith in the intelligence of his audience by never belaboring a point. The characters are engaging and the acting is very great. If your an adult child of divorce or a divorced parent who worries about your children, you're likely to recognize something in this film. (When Carter goes through his parents' divorce papers, try to catch some of the petty, ridiculous allegations each makes.) In this film, you see revealed some painful truths about human nature and complex family relationships--always with humor and compassion. This is one of the best comedies I've seen.",positive
Welcome to the Jungle,"Very bad modern parody of a great book: ""Lord of the flies"". Don't even worth to be seen for free...

Kristopher Van Varenberg could be the twins... who knows... Out of the Island, Phil (Huebel) is Chris (Brody)'s boss. He's an abusive boss, seconded by his right hand, Troy (Takahash). As the manager of the company feels his employees are not team players, he send them to an island to bond. The plane lands, the pilot dies and a very boring parody of ""Lord of the flies"" begins... It's not funny, it's not entertaining, it's just a waste of time.",negative
Welcome to the Jungle,"I thought this movie was really funny. The jokes and dialog was great (I actually did laugh through the whole show) and overall it was just an enjoyable escape. I thought all the actors did a great job, but I especially loved seeing JCVD do something different. Turns out, he's a pretty funny guy. I guess if you were expecting him to throw out a few karate kicks, that might be a let down. But I walked in just hoping to be entertained, and I definitely was. I don't watch that many comedies, so when I see one I like to laugh, not walk away more depressed than when I sat down. I wish more comedies were like this, because I would probably see more of them.",positive
I Am Not an Easy Man,"The film portrays a world where gender roles are reversed. All well and good, but it lacks any subtlety or nuance. Reversed means reversed - 180 degrees. Women wear suits and pee standing up - they basically are men, but with higher voices. Sure, it highlights just how gross men can behave, but it could have achieved greater impact by showing an alternative world where eomen are on top, but without resorting to gross behaviour. The result is a film where the two main characters are totally unsympathetic, and our interest and commitment soon wane.
A wasted opportunity, sadly.",negative
I Am Not an Easy Man,"People reviewing this movie poorly have missed the point. There is an ending and it is supposed to shock you into realising that this is the way the world actually is for women and how sad it is that this is reality.
I too wondered if they couldn't have made the feminine qualities dominant and masculine submissive but on further reflection, I think the way it was done was just right.
By flipping the gender roles so purely it is a great demonstration of how women live in this society.
I love, love, love the way Women's bodies are shot by the camera, just structurally without any sexualisation, this was very clever!
The film seems silly and fun on the surface but it relays a great message.
After watching this film with my (very straight, very white) father he came to the conclusion that maybe he had been underestimating how hard it is for women in our society (a big deal).
Please share this film with the men in your life and enjoy the sweet feeling of being understood.",positive
Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead,"This movie is (like part 1 before) really something else. Goofy, gory, funny, disgusting, ""politically incorrect"" slaughterhouse with excellent FX and a touch of Monty Python. Absurd at its best. Obviously, this could be filmed only in Europe (despite some American actors), in a country an abundance of sense of humor (like Norway in this case). This is also a rare occasion where the sequel is even better than the first part (and leaves room for more; looking forward to it). I mean, zombie movie cannot be fun if it is not really funny and entertaining (both for crew involved and the viewers). The director knows very well that the whole ""zombie thing"" is ridiculous and absurd in itself and takes such approach. No one should take this seriously (simply disregard ""historic"" part) and it does not insult viewers' intelligence. Just enjoy. Of course, if you missed part 1, don't miss it. Watch both one after another. Highly recommended.",negative
Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead,"Everything in zombie movies has been done to death (see what I did there?). And yet, here comes a movie that actually adds to the genre whilst simultaneously disgusting me and making me belly laugh. And not one of those infectious belly laughs. You know, when you are in a theatre and something mildly amusing on-screen sends a ripple through the crowd which grows; mostly because the girl down the front has a weird cackling laugh that morphs into a full-on snort fest, and that just sets everyone else off. Yeah, well, it's not like that.I was on my own. And I laughed out loud multiple times. I genuinely LOLed. That's as rare as rocking horse faeces. Dead Snow 1 was a revelation; a brilliant twist on the genre. Dead Snow 2 adds again. The comedy elements are ratcheted up as is the budget. A budget wisely spent on special effects and sheer scale. If you are after genuine chills and insights into the human condition, Dead Snow 2 will leave you cold (see what I did there too?). But if your appetite runs to comedic gore in the vein of Peter Jackson's 'Brain Dead', you will love this one.",positive
Journey to the West,"Warning: Spoilers This movie is a disaster with its horribly random script, flat characters, terrible CGI, and an unbelievable romance.So let's talk SCRIPT. This should be easy, because there isn't one. The story follows the exploits of a young demon hunter as he hunts down three demons: water and pig demon, and the Monkey King. There is no set up to each encounter as the title character Xuan Zang tends to show up out of the blue, do battle, fail, and get saved by a better demon hunter Miss Duan. That's how each fight transpires from start to finish over the course of a 2 hour movie. We never really learn much about the title characters or a handful of minor characters who randomly appear and disappear. The whole movie and the threat of these demons is just glossed over for special effect and battle pieces that get rather boring by the end of the film.Xuan Zang is the lead—a demon hunter who believes in reforming demons rather than killing them, but we never learn why. There are no flashbacks or character development to lead us to understand why he thinks so differently about the monsters. He's a typical Chow innocent, almost exactly like Chow's character in a dozen of his previous movies. He is horrible at what he does until the end when he finally rises to the occasion.Second central character is Miss Duan (the love interest). She appears to help him out against the water demon and then appears out of nowhere when he tries to fight the pig demon. All we know about her is that she isn't an innocent as she kills whoever steps in her path and doesn't know how to flirt or express herself without using her fist. She travels the world with her sister and a couple hired goons that we only see once in a prolonged sequence in the middle of the movie. Like everyone else in this movie we never learn enough about them to care.I understand this is a comedy/action/fantasy movie, but enough character background and development has to be done for us to root for them and sadly, there wasn't. When people start to die at the end—you don't care.The CGI is laughably bad. I'll be honest, during the sequence with the water demon (by far the best part of the whole film) the effects looked great. The water demon looked fantastic, but the pig, the green screen sets, and the over-the-top ending are just so cartoon and obviously fake that it takes away from the film.One of the biggest problems for the film is the forced romance between the central characters. There is no chemistry between them. Miss Duan follows Xuan Zang to each of his encounter with the demons to ensure his safety and when the battle is over tries to get him to confess he loves her, which is something he never does until the ending. She gets rejected, if I remember correctly, 3 or 4 times before (SPOILER WARNING) he finally admits to loving her for 10,000 years as she dies! This romance had about as much heat and passion in it as Twilight. I couldn't believe how flat and forced it was with no payoff.But there are more crimes against this movie which just annoyed me to no end—blatant stealing of items from other Stephen Chow movies. Now part of me believes that Stephen Chow didn't direct this whole movie—in fact, you can see that there are two directors.The Water Demon sequence is about 15 to 20 minutes long and is on a beautifully constructed set—similar to the one found in Kung Fu Hustle. The humor here is excellent, the camera shots, the tension, the drama, everything works perfectly. I was thrilled to be watching one of my favorite Chinese directors hit his mark and exceed. However, after that sequence and a short encounter with Xuan Zang's teacher, Buddha in earthly form, the film falls apart and the ripping off begins. Here are some examples: 1.) The Nursery Rhyme Book: in this film, Xuan Zang uses a book of nursery rhymes in an attempt to bring out the goodness in the demons. Other demon hunters laugh at him and mock him from using it, which later turns out to be a very powerful weapon against the Monkey King. In Kung Fu Hustle it's the same thing—main character buys a book of Kung Fu from a guy, everyone thinks it's a joke, but later on he realizes how to use and becomes a great Kung Fu master.2.) The score from this movie comes from Kung Fu Hustle.3.) Prince Important uses magic swords to fight in the exact same way as the blind music killers from Kung Fu Hustle.4.) (SPOILERS) Buddha kills the Monkey King with the Palm Stephen Chow's character in Kung Fu Hustle used to defeat the villain.All these factors lead me to believe that Stephen Chow directed the first part and was basically helping with the film rather than directing. If I am wrong, then it's a sad day when you see such comedic genius fall so far from grace. If you want to see a hilarious Stephen Chow movie about the Journey to the West see his old movies instead.The last thing I will mention is the endingoh man, what a joke! (SPOILERS) In the end, the three demons join our main character as he travels to the west to spread the word of Buddha—but why would you want to see the continued adventures of a demon who ate a little girl, a demon that had a hotel used to lure travelers so he could eat them, or a Monkey King who ripped a guy's throat out and killed the main characters love?",negative
Journey to the West,"Fortunately, the movie packs Stephen Chow's comedic style, or I would call it contains his soul. There's Chow's usual style of comedy, action, love story, and some meaning behind life. Well, what more is needed in a blockbuster movie? Unfortunately, nothing is perfect. I went into the cinema without any expectation, and I didn't read any reviews so I could enjoy the whole movie as if I was the first to do so. I understand that Chow directed this movie, and even demonstrated to retain the ""feel"" of his usual style. Still, I find the first 15 minutes of the movie to be a little dry in terms of humor. As the protagonist enters the scene it was a bit difficult for me to laugh. However, as the story unfolds, and as the mainstream humor pours in, laughter floods the cinema wave after another. To add, the protagonist's wacky hair style, does resemble Chow in some ways.The CGI is of top quality, I can see the movie spending a lot of money on CGI. Many of the scenes contain a lot of visual detail and picturesque grounds. The music is familiar and lovely, I shall not reveal too much.Show Luo's appearance in this movie was like his usual funny-self in his TV entertainment news. I would appreciate it more if he would have neglected his usual style and adopted a new one. It's not a bad thing, but it's not a good thing too, it lies somewhere on the neutral side. I guess on the good side, his fans will love to see him.Trying my best not to disclose too much. This movie is a prequel to his previous 2 part movie, ""A Chinese Odyssey Part One: Pandora's Box, and A Chinese Odyssey Part Two: Cinderella."" The essence of this movie is how it somehow relates to ""A Chinese Odyssey"" in terms of how life is, in its cycle. The feelings the protagonist experienced in this movie is similar to what his disciple experienced in ""A Chinese Odyssey"". The good news for those who haven't seen ""A Chinese Odyssey"", is that you can watch this movie on its own.Lastly, there are some tear-jerking scenes. My eyes welled up at some parts, but I stayed a man. I would give this a 9.5 out of 10 because of its imperfection, but the scores only allow whole numbers. So.... enjoy the movie.",positive

A Perfect Day,"Well, I called it. As soon as I saw the trailer, the only word I could think of was 'aimless'. And sure enough, the ironically titled A Perfect Day, turns out to be a not so perfect day at the theatre. The film tries desperately to combine road trip elements with social commentary on warfare and aid workers in Balkan conflict zones, but the end result is boring and pointless, an unbalanced mess of ideas. Road trip? More like road tripe. Mambrú (Benicio del Toro) is overseeing the removal of a fat corpse from a well 'somewhere in the Balkans' as the film puts it. The rotting corpse doesn't exactly help things on the sanitary front, as you can imagine. Like my patience, the rope is wearing thin and rope snaps. So begins a trip across the countryside to secure some new rope. He is joined by his rather eccentric partner, B (Tim Robbins, who's sporting the biggest, most unnatural looking set of pearly whites I've ever seen), new blood Sophie, a translator, and an old flame, Katya (Olga Kurylenko). Along the way, they'll meet people, bump into the U.N., etc. I can't sum it up much better than that.I'll get right down to it: this movie is so terribly balanced I'd almost say it suffers from bipolar disorder. I get that it tries to combine the appeal of a road trip movie with some serious storytelling, but it just never works. You jump from a zany scene to a sad one, all the while questioning how you're supposed to take any of it seriously. A perfect example: early on, when the new girl Sophie sees the body in the well, she freaks out in a way that feels like it should elicit laughter: 'haha, that's cute, she's not used to bodies yet.' Mambrú and B's reactions seem to confirm this. Later, Mambrú and Sophie are in a ruined house looking for rope. Sophie opens a door, but doesn't notice a body hanging behind her. Mambrú tries to spare her the trauma, but Sophie of course sees the body and freaks out. She freaks out in the same way again, but this time it's supposed to be taken seriously. But how can I take it seriously when the film was using her reaction for laughs earlier? Other examples include the gang driving through the mountains as rock music plays, when suddenly we get a scene where they have to drive away from soldiers rounding up people to be shot; A major subplot involves Mambrú and Katya who used to be lovers. Mambrú's surprised by her appearance and they have some conversations where they dance around the issue. Despite seeing someone else, he still has feelings for her, although he wouldn't admit to this. The same goes for her. Watching their banter is about as interesting as you'd expect, but in the end it doesn't contribute anything to the plot nor does B contribute anything except a few laughs. Sophie goes from oblivious newbie to 'having learned the ways of the world', but it's not the focus of the film, so why should I care? Needless to say, the acting, while decent, cannot save this walking identity crisis. Not even Tim Robbins and his great white teeth can save it. It's not a case of the actors failing the movie, but the movie failing the actors. It's the kind of experience where, instead of being absorbed by the *clears throat* 'drama', you're trying to peek inside the actors' heads and wonder what's really going through their minds.I can see what the filmmakers were going for, but the few scenes that bordered on interesting just made me wish they didn't waste their time with boring romances and botched attempts at road trippy humor and instead took things a little more seriously. There are poignant scenes, like the one where Mambrú struggles with his own uselessness when attempting to help others. Here, notions of helping others on a large or small scale, bureaucracy, usefulness, etc. are all touched upon, but the film's all-over-the-place attitude prevents you from taking it as seriously as you'd want to. Right when the credits started rolling, there were high school kids in the front row clapping. Pray for them, dear reader. Pray for them.",negative
A Perfect Day,"M*A*S*H in Bosnia? It centres around Mambru (Benicio del Toro) and B (Tim Robbins), a couple of aid workers in the Balkans during the conflict of the 90s. Working with an NGO known as Aid Across Borders, they deal with the horrors of the war and the vicious consequences of ethnic hatred almost on a daily basis. The film begins with the pair trying to raise a morbidly obese body from a well in a remote village before it can contaminate the water supply. A lack of suitable rope hampers their mission thus setting them off in search of equipment. Further complications arise when the UN administration specifically forbids them to remove the body for fear of upsetting the locals. The UN adviser who is compiling a report on the team's efficiency is ""conflict evaluator"" Katya (former Bond girl Olga Kuylenko), who had a relationship with Mambru that ended badly. Tension is in the air as they set off with their interpreter Damir (Fedja Stukan) and new recruit Sophie (Melanie Thierry) on a journey that reveals some of the horror of war. And Nikola (Eldar Reisdovic), an orphan boy they come across, puts a more human face on the carnage and adds a more sympathetic element to the material. A Perfect Day is the first English language feature for Spanish director Fernando Leon de Aranoa (Barrio, Familia, etc), and he maintains a light touch throughout. He mixes black humour with an exploration of the absurdity of military authority and the futility of war. Black humour at the expense of military authority and the helplessness of the UN is reminiscent of the classic M*A*S*H. In one of his better performances for some time Robbins is excellent here with his irreverent sense of humour and acerbic observations, while Del Toro's swarthy presence, cynicism and ironic detachment adds gravitas. Their banter is amusing, and alleviates some of the tension of the dramatic journey through this war torn countryside. Alex Catalan's superb cinematography of the arid mountain landscapes and war devastated backdrop further enhances this enjoyable comedy/drama. This ironically titled pitch black comedy has been one of the early highlights of MIFF.",positive

This movie defines Bollywood development.. and Hrthik is awesome in this movie... + dance scenes also so great music (restaurant scene)You should watch it, better then original!Also listen soundtrack after movie, i can't stop it!",positive
Wetlands,"I instantly knew that this film was written and directed by men, because the female characters, including Helen, the main character, lack any credibility to me, as a woman. I also felt that the shock factor was only used to make money, not really to achieve any artistic or philosophical depth. It's difficult to shock these days, the film does it by an (excessive) exposure of all kinds of body fluids and dirt, to the point of boredom. I also felt that the main character was shallow and not likable in any way. I'm a big fan of Lars von Trirer and nothing of that which is human is alien to me. But this felt like a desperate call for attention, rather than a valuable (while shocking) cinema.",negative
Wetlands,"I am a student and admirer of the works Antoine Artaud and am very pleased to see a movie breathing the spirit of my second favorite insane Frenchman. This movie is aimed at the idiots who think they have to bear children. The body fluids and bleeding assholes are metaphors for what happens in the minds of children of infantile parents. I'm not big on symbolism in movies, but this thing a Bosch puzzle, it just goes on an on.. Four guys jerking off in a pizza, I think it's brilliant, think about it, what do these parents feed their kids spiritually? Crap topped with crap. It is no wonder says she has had herself sterilized because she doesn't want any kids. The sad and also - in a perverted way - beauty of the end is that, life repeats itself. The asshole represents the circle of life. This is what Fassbinder would make if he would be alive. Have you paid attention to the face lines of this woman? It's very similar to Fassbinder's heroins. Life is good in Germany, you can tell by movies like this. No freedom for an honest movie here in the US.",positive
Dilwale,It is hilarious to see the first 4 pages of reviews of Dilwale has a 10* rating which was rather surprising to me. So I go in to the profile of each of those people and there you have it most of the reviewers had joined IMDb in Dec and this is the only movie they have rated.It is just sad when movie makers have to create fake profiles and rate the movie high so the public would fall for it and watch the movie. But this is such a sad strategy as we can not be fooled for long.I wanted to check the reviews first before watching the movie but thankfully the real reviews from real people have told me exactly what i needed to know!,negative
Dilwale,The script for this was written by a 6 year old who watched too many Hollywood. That is the only way I can interpret this movie. More that half of this movie is CARS and then some Michael Bay sh*t. The song locations or songs not make any sense.I like SRK and Kajol as couple but I never expected that they will act in such a movie. Even half the dialogs were reference to other movies. The action scenes were too short for enjoyment. If you go too deep in movie for logic (I always do because I want good logic in a good movie) then you will bang your head against the wall.My conclusion is that if you are looking to waste 2h 38m of your time and to see the return of SRK and Kajol jodi then go watch the film. But if you're looking for a good story or at least a logical film then really don't waste your money or your time. Thank you!,positive
Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie,"I was really hoping this would be as funny and clever as the TV series, unfortunately it was torture to sit through, i so wanted to get up and leave and tbh i wouldn't have missed a thing if i did as it didn't get any better. It was an even keel of rubbish.I can't believe the BBC were behind this embarrassing movie, i guess they saw £pound signs first, which is fair enough but PLEASE make a bit of effort at least! And i couldn't believe when the credits rolled to reveal that Jennifer Saunders wrote the screenplay.I remember Keith Lemon:The Film getting panned by the critics and public, this is easily as bad or worse!The celebrity cameo's in this movie were embarrassing to watch and they will surely regret there decisions to be in this once they see it for themselves. And the non ""celebrity"" actors/actresses involved seemed as if they were pulled off the street, very amateur and over the top, like Edina's granddaughter Lola for example.The movie felt sooo cheap considering the glamour involved with the characters. Patsy and Edina did the best they could to wring laughs from every situation but it just didn't work...i just can't believe Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley went through with this without some sort of clearer plan to make it a fun movie at least even if it wasn't as laugh-out-loud, i mean there TV shows were all well made! It felt like it was trying to be a American comedy movie in its form but it came across more like those cheap and nasty cash-in American spoof movies like Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, etc., which you would probably get more laughs from tbh.In an audience of about 30 people there was only a few slight giggles from a couple of people throughout the whole film which isn't really enough to qualify as a comedy success sorry to say. I watched Central Intelligence last week and that had the same audience reaction BUT it was a fun movie and i left with a smile on my face so i gave that an average 6/10, just for the fun factor.I liked the Absolutely Fabulous trailer so all i can say is if you like the trailer then just be prepared for that to be the best thing about this whole project.1/10",negative
Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie,"I have loved Ab Fab from day one, back in 1992 and have a boxset I sometimes still dig out and watch when I have time. Last night I chose to watch the movie over watching Wales win their way to their first semi final ever in the Euros. That's how much I love the series and had been looking forward to the film hitting the cinema!I love the characters Eddy and Patsy - always thought Jennifer Saunders is hilarious, even when she was still doing French and Saunders. Joanna Lumley looks fantastic though and what a great actress with perfect comedy timing at 70! - and this movie delivers its familiar in your face parody of the fashion scene and PR business, showing how pretentious they are with sharp satire. It returned to everything that was witty in the first few series, with outrageous behaviour from the lead characters. I may be biased because I am such a huge fan, so if you love the series like I do, you won't be disappointed.",positive
Newton,"Newton (2017):
Most of the people are unaware of a film named Newton until it was selected as an official entry to 90th Academy Awards from India.This low-profile film has attracted audience after its Oscar-entry buzz and even the reviews are highly positive.Starring Rajkumar Rao (2017's surprise star of Bollywood) and limited cast,Newton is directed by Amit Masurkar,who earlier directed Sulemani Keeda.SO how is Newton?Plot:Nutan Kumar alias Newton (Raj Kumar Rao),a government clerk on election duty in the conflict ridden jungle of Central India tries his best to conduct free and fair voting despite the apathy of security forces and the looming fear of guerrilla attacks by communist rebels.My Review:
Newton is one such message-oriented film which will equally impress both art and commercial audience alike.It is brilliantly funny poignant film which every Indian must watch.""Do you know what your problem is?"" a veteran election instructor asks a newbie.The youngster replies: ""My honesty?""""No,"" says the older gentleman, ""your problem is your pride in your honesty.""This conversation between Rajkumar Rao and Sanjay Mishra is one of the best scenes I have seen this year.In the same scene,Sanjay Mishra compares Newton's view is similar to Isaac Newton's view.Director masterfully wrote such strong scenes in the beginning of the movie which really created strong impact throughout the movie and even after coming out after watching it.Writer-director Amit Masurkar and Mayank Tewari have painfully captured the bittersweet essence of the people of an obscure jungle that's far-flung from civilization.Masurkar razes multiple Hindi film clichés to the ground in Newton by resorting to low-key black comedy to tell a tale of Adivasis being pulled in different directions by the police and Naxalites on election day, by making an Adivasi - that too a woman - one of the agents of change in the film, and by conceiving Newton as a man of indeterminate caste, even if clearly not an Adivasi himself.Newton is a dark comedy that gives you equal measures of dread and disillusionment and hope and hilarity. It makes you see the pitfalls of the democratic system but also tells you that it's the only one capable of positive change. This is reality at its finest, with credible performances and backdrops that immerse viewers into the world and where even the faces of the background characters leave a heartbreaking impression. The script is full of humorous touches and intricate visual details.Once again Rajkumar Rao proved that he is the upcoming gem of Bollywood.He gave a powerful innocent performance with perfection.Pankaj Tripathi is the show-stealer with his career best performance.Rest of the cast also impressed a lot with their natural acting skills.So,Newton is one of the best political satires I had seen from Indian Cinema.A Must Watch..My Rating 8/10",negative
Newton,"I saw this fabulous Indian film called ""Newton"" last night which by the way is the only Indian film to be screened at this year's New Zealand International Film Festival. This film was screened at Cannes and I guess this is the second festival after the Festival de Cannes where it is being showcased. In a nutshell, this film is about an election officer who takes the responsibility of going into a forest ridden with armed revolutionaries in order to collect votes from the local residents.I had read somewhere that Isaac Newton, the genius scientist, was actually a very complicated man. His namesake in this film seemed no different. While his intentions were good, his method of executing them was questionable. Which is why when you see this film, you will wonder if the protagonist is actually the antagonist. Everything in cinema is a matter of perspective. The film is infused with dark humour from start to finish and Rajkumar Rao is nothing short of a brilliant actor.Because this was a festival film, I saw this film with a primarily Kiwi audience which is always a great thing. I want Indian films to have a global audience. If main-stream Bollywood films don't attract a foreign fan-following, art-house festival circuit low-budget films certainly will. It is so ironic that I saw this film at a time when New Zealand is preparing for the upcoming elections This film appeared so minimalist yet was nothing short of a funny edge-of-the-seat thriller.",positive
Dil Dhadakne Do,"Look of film is rich as their characters but they behave like a typical middle class family. I could have accepted it with few ones but every one!!!! Then what was the need to show them upper class!? Cruise thing was just stuffed to add some grandeur in film and it adds but nothing to add any entertainment or any good use of it in film plot except in boring way in climax. Writer and director had taken audiences for granted as if they belong to the family, whose story is being told. Lots of character confuse audience to understand the movie. There are very few emotional scenes and that too are mixed with some quirky humour so nothing comes to audience very clearly. There are few good emotional scenes, precisely shot actually, Neelam Mehara eating cake while crying, Anil Kapoor grabs Rahul Bose neck. Love track doesn't have any scene to mention. Its narrative style from the dog perspective doesn't appeal. Film bores and length makes it more boring. Performance wise Anil Kapoor and Shefali Shah as Neelam Mehra are very good. Rest are just OK. Music also bores as the lyrics.",negative
Dil Dhadakne Do,"The people who are saying this movie is not good clearly don't know anything about films.Dil Dhhadakne do is one of my favourite films.It is inspiring,beautiful,funny and just a full package.The film has a soul and is just a masterpiece from the director Zoya Akhtar.",positive
A Haunted House 2,"I have not seen the first ""A Haunted House"" film, but after sitting through this dreadful sequel I don't think I would like to. Why this trashy unpleasant film was released on Easter weekend is beyond me.There is no coherent story. Upon getting over an ex-girlfriend who got possessed by evil spirits, Malcolm hooks up and moves in with a new girl Megan and her two kids. What follows is an embarrassing mishmash of scenes from recent big hits in the horror genre, ""Sinister"", ""Insidious"" and ""The Conjuring,"" as Malcolm continues to be terrorized by demonic events. Marlon Wayans plays Malcolm in the most irritating and annoying manner, with his non-stop loud screaming and nonsensical ranting. He has a prolonged, uncomfortable and unfunny sex sequence where Marlon gets it on with a doll that looks like the diabolical Annabelle from ""The Conjuring"". More awful jokes of such sick sexual nature would recur through the rest of the film.You go into a spoof film like this to have a shallow laugh out of jokes inspired by your favorite horror films. However, within the first few minutes, you already get the feeling that this film will not entertain you at all. In fact, it could even be quite boring, with very long humorless scenes that overstay their welcome. There are many scenes which would offend pet lovers, Catholics, Mexicans, women, and practically everyone else. I found it interesting only when it tries to recreate a recognizable scene from those modern horror classics, like the group hanging from ""Sinister"" or the ""Hide and Clap"" game from ""The Conjuring"". But unfortunately, I wind up disappointed because its spoofing just falls terribly flat. I would have had a good time if a film was dumb and funny, but this film is just plain dumb, not funny. 1/10.",negative
A Haunted House 2,"I have not been usually a fan of Marlon Wayans in movies. I loved his brother Damon and loved the family in sketch comedy in In Livin Color. But in Scary Movie I thought he over played his parts. So much that it wasn't funny. And White Chicks was only funny because of Terry Crews. In face the only Scary Movie I liked was the ""Grab my Little Hand"" one and the one with the Spoof genius Charley Sheen who dominated Hot Shots and Part Deux in a way that would make Monty Python or Mel Brooks proud. A Haunted House 1 fell short as well although some parts made me snicker. A HH2 though was pure genius. I can see a lot of people not getting the humor but I'm pretty sure anyone my age understood it perfectly. Us 90's kids grew up hearing these type laughs. From them moving in all the way to the Warrans I laughed and laughed out loud non-stop. I am definitely buying this and watching it until I wear it out and the humor isn't funny anymore. Give it a shot and don't worry about the plot. Just listen to Marlons take on women problems, and how he handles or should I say can't handle the paranormal. All stereotypes are touched just as the Great Dave Chappelle. Actually that is a perfect reference. If you liked the Dave Chapelle show and laughed hard at that, you'll love this. If not, then go watch CSI or How to Lose A Guy In 10 Days. You will be better off",positive
Perfectos desconocidos,"It loses the magic of the italian original, for me, it's only worth a watch if you haven't seen the 2016 Perfetti Sconosciuti.",negative
Perfectos desconocidos,"""Perfectos Desconocidos"" is a Spanish remake of the Italian movie ""Perfetti sconosciuti""; both have been very successful in its own country; but as I am from Spanish origin; I prefer the Spanish one.
Seven friends everyone with his own crisis reunites for a dinner in a house. Somebody proposes a game; left all cell phone on the tables so everybody can see secrets of the others.
Things get unexpectedly complicated as a secret of each person is being revealed. 
There are outstanding comedy moments and suspenseful as well. One particular conversation between a father and her daughter carriers more tenderness than any flick released in 2017.
This kind of movie can only works with outstanding actors; and all of them are.
It will be unfair to point on one in specific since this is coral movie; however Eduard Fernandez and Ernesto Alterio are both commanding.
In brief; it is perhaps the best 2017 comedy; with the Italian original being the best of 2016.",positive
The English Teacher,"In Kingston, Pennsylvania, the forty-five year-old lonely spinster Linda Sinclair (Julianne Moore) is a high-school English teacher with a routine life that loves literature. When she stumbles with her former student Jason Sherwood (Michael Angarano), she learns that he has returned from New York after failing as a playwright in Broadway. Linda borrows his play named ""The Chrysalis"" to read and she loves the play. Then she shows ""The Chrysalis"" to the drama teacher Carl Kapinas (Nathan Lane) and they decide to produce the play in the high-school. However Vice Principal Phil Pelaski (Norbert Leo Butz) and Principal Trudie Slocum (Jessica Hecht) are against the production since the conclusion is too dark for the students and they can not exceed the budget. Carl offers to change the ending and Linda offers to cover any amount that exceeds the budget. However, along the rehearsals, the naive Linda learns that real life is not a literature and people are flawed and may disappoint.""The English Teacher"" is an unpleasant movie with despicable characters; Julianne Moore's actress and her character are the only attraction of this movie. Jason Sherwood is a liar and ungrateful character; Carl Kapinas is a sophisticated ridiculous character incapable to keep and assume his own word; Halle Anderson and Will are among the worst that you can expect from teenagers. Linda Sinclair is unselfish teacher that sponsors the production of the play for love for the art, but is not supported by the selfish Jason Sherwood and Carl Kapinas and has her career destroyed by the disgusting Halle Anderson and Will. My questions to the writers Dan Chariton and Stacy Chariton are: Do you believe your story is funny? What is the message of this story? My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Adorável Professora"" (""Adorable Teacher"")",negative
The English Teacher,"This is one of those indie movies that is much better than many big budget feature film comedies.The story combines original comedy, a touching partly dramatic climax and a feel good plot that comes together perfectly. The comments on screen are an original touch. No wonder such a top notch cast appears in it.The performances are stellar. Julianne Moore gives a wonderfully varied and moving performance as a spinster English Teacher in high school who mounts the play of an ex student played by Michael Angarano. She can do comedy just as well as she does drama and biopics. The supporting cast includes Broadway veterans Jessica Hecht and Norbert Leo Butz as school principals, Nathan Lane as the diva of a drama teacher, the lovely Lily Collins as a high school student and aspiring actress and finally Greg Kinnear as the young playwright's father.This is one of the best indie comedies in years and deserves much more critical acclaim and financial success than it received. Look forward to seeing more from the screen writing duo who penned the story.",positive
Bareilly Ki Barfi,"For me, I was actually enjoying the movie. But not the ending...
I liked the main actor's character at first, looked and acted very decent until the character unravels. He is only decent around the girl but his heart is not. I do not think he deserve to be with the girl. I mean the last scene was so cringe when Chirag was happy and telling Pritam that Pritam taunted Chirag so much (basically like a week I bet!)...and they both laughed as it was so hilarious or something (and we forget that Chirag bullied Pritam for 5 years or so..lol)**they were not even friends, movie narrator even said 'mu bola dost'Chirag also said he learned his lessons (as being a selfless human) because he wants the girl (Bitti) to be happy. So, he would let her marry Pritam.
Well, same thing happened with his first love? He lets her marry off with another guy.. he was crying and all. So, what did he learn that time then?Also about Pritam's life. All the mental and physical abuse Chirag did. No one is going to talk about it? Felt so bad for the poor guy.**Lastly they become friends for real? sure :3(Just shared my personal opinion, I watched this movie lightly, sorry, that my comment isn't light enough)peace",negative
Bareilly Ki Barfi,"How often you watch a Movie which is so well and solidly written that the characters are tremendously real. The actors portraying those roles they appear utmost genuine and authentic to the audience. Well, Bareilly Ki Barfi is one such movie. Set in the small town of Barielly (Uttar Pradesh) we get introduced to the characters within five - ten minutes of the movie playing by the Voice - Over/Narrator (thanks to Javed Akhtar). We get introduced to Mishra Family, Father (Mr. Narottam Mishra) played superbly and excellent by Pankaj Mishra. Mom (played brilliantly by Seema Pahwa) and Bitti (played excellently by Kriti Sanon). They have a sweet shop just attached to their home which is run by Narottam Mishra. Seema Pahwa is a teacher in a primary school and Bitti Mishra works in Power Sub - Station like a Customer Care or Support Executive answering and attending phone calls. Hats off to Ashwini Iyer Tiwari for beautifully portraying the relationship between father and daughter (Pankaj Mishra and Kriti Sanon respectively). I mean how often in Bollywood Movies you see father borrowing a cigarette from his daughter, and on top of that he gives all that space and liberty to his daughter. Bitti's mother too remains suspicious and revolting for her daughter and her actions. Worried still that she may never get married after being rejected twice. Bitti later on finds support and solace in an nondescript and inconspicuous novel published by a Printing Press owner (Chirag Dubey played remarkably well by Ayushmaan Khurrana). The Novel's Title and Film's are Namesake. Bitti after reading the novel correlates with our own self like all the habits which she had bear a stark similarity with the female protagonist in the Novel. She gets smitten and falls in love with the Author of the Novel - Bareilly Ki Barfi. Here is the twist in the story. Even though Author of the Novel is none another than Chirag Dubey (Ayushmaan Khurrana) himself, who is heart - broken as his first love affair ended in a tragedy and was a disaster believes and fears that there will be backlash from women in the society and also his first love will be dishonored. Having said that, he asks his close friend Pritam Vidrohi (played ultimately well by Rajkummar Rao) to publish his name and photograph at the back of the Novel and credit him as the Author of the Novel. Pritam reluctantly agrees, but immediately after leaves Bareilly and settles in Lucknow by managing a job at a Saree Store. In the meanwhile Chirag falls in love with Bitti. On the other hand Bitti asks Chirag to fix up a meeting with Pritam and she desperately wants to meet him. In this era of Whatsapp, Facebook, Messenger who cares for hand written letters. They are a thing of bygone era. But wait, Writer and Director (Nitesh Tiwari and Ashwini Iyer Tiwari) bring this bygone thing and portray it to immaculate perfection onto the screen. Bareilly Ki Barfi is very simple and ordinary love story or I will say Love Triangle, but narrated, portrayed and enacted brilliantly and flawlessly. Also, take a look at the characters, they are so real and sincerely true in their emotions, behaviors, mannerisms. Right from the first frame to the moment when the end credits roll along, you as audience tend to flow with the narrative and in fact try to identify and associate with all of the characters. This is the power of script and screenplay and not to mention the direction. Must watch specially if you believe in good, clean and wholesome cinema.",positive
Rudderless,"Great original storyline that takes you on an emotional roller-coaster and leaves you thinking about it for days! I loved the music and that Billy Crudup and Anton Yelchin actually sing themselves...then there is their performances which was powerful. Not many movies impress me these days, which says a lot being that I watch more movies then anyone I know. This is a sad movie though that makes you think and adjust your perspective towards people. This movie might not be for everyone, but I don't think you can watch it without using the word WOW at least once. I ended up buying the album afterward. Great directorial debut from William H.

HE SANG!I was not familiar with him (I know, I know)and I thought he must be a professional singer who was acting. Billy Crudup was also a huge talent that I was also unfamiliar with. His voice was amazing but his acting was off the charts. You could really feel his emotion and understand his thoughts. The rest of the cast was also stellar. I am chomping at the bit for the soundtrack to come out. I will be the first in line. Thank you William H. Macy for an amazing piece of work!",positive
And So It Goes,". . . from one of the most frenetic birthing scenes since GONE WITH THE WIND to graphic footage of butterfly reproduction. AND SO IT GOES from the dope house to the prison cell, featuring characters who have real life jobs and problems. Since the action is set and filmed in Connecticut, there are none of those ubiquitous palm trees that mar so many Hollywood pictures shot in California and other Southern states. When things look bleakest in this tale, baseball comes to the rescue. Violence and animal abuse are kept to a minimum, as the main action sequence involves an ""Oopsie!"" on a slip-and-slide. AND SO IT GOES from second chances to third or fourth tries, with every well-developed character serving a purpose. Aging actress Diane Keaton gets to laugh, cry, and croon about a dozen Golden Oldies, while the geriatric Michael Douglas proves he's still fit enough to carry a skinny 10-year-old girl at least 12 feet. AND SO IT GOES.",negative
And So It Goes,"If you were told to watch a movie directed by Rob Reiner, starring Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton, with a budget of $30 mil. you could think that you are about to experience a movie with powerful emotions and an interesting plot.Actually, in the end, this is a rather simple movie and its course is obvious from the beginning.Michael Douglas plays Oren Little, a realtor who's about to retire after he makes his last sale, and Diane Keaton plays his singer next-door neighbor. What will happen between them is to be seen (I won't spoil it for you) but I'm pretty sure you have already guessed.The acting from the 2 veteran actors is effortless but the direction from the once-mighty Rob Reiner is too simple and targeting more for a few easy laughs if nothing else. Note that Reiner is also in the movie as the pianist who plays for Diane Keaton's character.It's a dramedy more than just a comedy but even the dramatic elements are more likely to promote laughter, if not anything else.There a couple of good songs sang by Keaton (?) and you also get to see Grease's Frankie Valli in a cameo appearance.Overall: It's OK. Douglas/Keaton are fun to watch, but don't expect greatness.",positive
Dear White People,"I watched,with great pain,the pitifully biased and nonsensical film that attempted to elevate the discourse on real racism and its presence in our world. Well funded and full of passion,it simply shows whites as the worst people,ever. The black people in the film,ironically,came off just one half a notch less awful. Im a glass half full type,so I have more optimism than the cynic that penned this thing,but the answer to this problem is NOT to write a film that portrays whites as whiskey drinking KKK types with greasy hair and hate in their hearts. The only answer is truth. Pursue it. This is NOT the truth. Just a slant.",negative

Deathgasm,But the music was weak and laden with synthesizers. It was like a pop band with get-up and of course the jokes were juvenile. I guess this is a joke like Baby'metal' or something.,negative
Deathgasm,"This is what I like when it's about gore. It has to be funny, otherwise just watch a horror movie instead. I would not call this horror but just gory comedy. The best movie in that genre still remains Braindead, and of course the Evil Dead movies, but this one I will remember as well. The exaggeration in the gory details is what makes it funny. The amount of slashed body parts and the inventive ways they use to do it is just hilarious. The script might not be the best ever but that's not what it is about with a movie like Deathgasm. It's just a bit fun. Fun for people like me that get that kind of humor. Some others will probably hate that movie and that's okay. If you like metal music and gore then you will for sure love this movie. I did and I will watch this one again in a few years.",positive

Script is well knitted & director has full control on the minutest details. 9. Each scene is well directed. 10. Akshay is redefining his own benchmark in each film. He has developed a perfect comic sense & timing to deliver dialogue. 11. Overall a genuine social cause has been presented in a perfect frame which penetrates deep into the hearts of each Indian, whether the person has a toilet in his home or not. 12. The best scene of Akshay in my opinion that moved the audience is, while the toilet he constructed for his wife, was ruthlessly broken by his own father. OVERALL TOILET is a perfect combination of social cause & entertainment. movie deserves TAX FREE in all over India.

Elvis & Nixon,Casting in a movie like this is supremely important because the content is not favorable or intriguing and as a matter of fact bizarre.It only holds value in that its a true story with two famous people involved.Shannon does a terrible job attempting and failing to portray Elvis as he might have been at the time. His moves facially and bodily are not consistent with Elvis moves. His speech mannerisms suffer greatly as well.Shannon is a very good actor but he should have not taken the part.Did he ever see Elvis in any of his portrayals?Elvis at 35 years old he was an extremely handsome and a vibrant person.Shannon looks lots older and could not begin to look like Elvis.Take a look at the 68 comeback special to see what he looked like then check out Shannon and his looks.Sorry ...we are Elvis fans forever and this portrayal was horrible.Spacey as Nixon was also poor.Its not his fault. He captured verylittle of what Nixon looked or sounded like.With Shannon its the same but of the two Spacey was better.We gave them all the benefit of the doubt but the next day we felt themovie is very flawed.Its a shame that we as fans lost the opportunity to enjoy a performance that would have more celebrated Elvis Life instead of demeaning it.,negative
Elvis & Nixon,"I really hadn't heard much about this film, and certainly wasn't going in expecting an Elvis impersonator or someone looking exactly like President Nixon. Wasn't disappointed there in regard to Elvis. Michael Shannon didn't look much like Elvis, but he did have the soft voice, the southern charm thing going for him. He did a fine job with this role. And actually, Kevin Spacey did manage to look a great deal like Nixon. Sounded like him, too. Everyone in this movie did a good job, and worked the roles of those involved in this slightly absurd moment in history to justice. So, I guess what I was, was really pleasantly surprised by this picture. Totally enjoyed myself with lots of laughs and a few poignant moments. I dimly remember this episode with Elvis showing up at the White House wanting to become an FBI Agent Abroad. With a badge. And at the time I recall thinking that only Elvis could be that naïve and yet that brash at the same time. In all honesty, this picture managed to show all of that, and more. What a colorful moment in American history all wrapped up in this fine little film.",positive
The Bélier Family,"Paula is an average country-girl who discovers that she has the gift of singing. Her music teacher even suggests that he coaches her for a big audition, the Maîtrise of Radio France in Paris. The only snag is: Paula's entire family (mother, father and brother) are deaf, and they need her as a translator to the ""hearing world"".This is actually a very conventional ""I have a dream""-type movie which centers around real-life French casting show participant Anne Peichert aka Louane Emera, who plays a simple schoolgirl (albeit one with golden tresses and the looks of model) who comes up in the world and emancipates herself from her parents, has to deal with puberty, finding a boyfriend, and getting along with classmates and pesky teachers.To add a bit of flair to the story, it is offset by the chaotic deaf family on the one hand, and the high-strung music teacher on the other. Karin Viard as the ditzy mother, Francois Damiens as the anarchist father and Eric Elmosino as the Michel-Sardou-worshipping music teacher are putting in extra shifts to save this movie from becoming a teenage shlockfest.As someone who deals with hearing children of deaf parents (they're called CODA - Children Of Deaf Adults) professionally, I have to say that it's highly unusual for deaf parents to be so dependent on a translator or facilitator. They can usually read lips just fine.But basically this is not a documentary but a movie squarely aimed at teenage girls.",negative
The Bélier Family,"We were darling and I went out last night to the movies to see ""Bélier Family"" One we talked a lot, especially heard he must go see it! The first reason for my desire to see this film is that Damiens Francois there take a role. This is a player that I discovered it a few years now and I find him absolutely fabulous in particular in ""Heartbreaker"" with Vanessa Paradis and Romain Duris. Eric Elmosnino and Karin Viard are remarkable too, distribution is very perfect. The story of this young girl ""Paula Bélier"" embodied by Louane Emera is absolutely moving. If you decided to go see this movie you will be unable to hold your tears, this film was great for my darling and me",positive

Batman and Harley Quinn,"I paid twenty bucks to see this movie in the cinema. Twenty bucks to watch Harley Quinn farting in the Batmobile and Batman telling Nightwing it ""smells like discipline."" I'm serious. The movie was bad enough before that with Harley complaining about being treated like a sex object only to then have her way with Nightwing tied to her bed, but the fart scene was as much as I could take. Yes, I endured the rest of this in order to review it but nothing could save it by then. Poor writing, too many convenient plot devices and a really lazy ending. Plus a post-credit sequence that went for 3.5 minutes and had zero relevance to the actual plot of the movie! I really hope this isn't the direction the DC animated universe is heading, because if that's the case I'm done with it.",negative
Batman and Harley Quinn,"I don't understand the low rating?Batman and Harley Quinn was fun, sexy, and very entertaining to watch. I really liked Melissa Rauch as Harley Quinn, and I really like it when she tied up Nightwing and seduces him. The story and plot are easy to follow along. Harley working alongside Batman and Nightwing is a great touch, and I wonder if Nightwing and Harley will continue to be friends with benefits as long as she stays on her meds? It seems Batman just doesn't trust or thinks Harley is sane enough to make it a permanent relationship. I don't really know what's going to happen, I'm new to the Batman DVD's and haven't really been interested in them until lately.",positive
In a World...,"'IN A WORLD': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Actress Lake Bell makes her feature film directorial and writing debut with this indie comedy about a woman struggling to compete in the male dominated movie trailer voice-over world. The title refers to one of the most common trailer voice-over lines in film history (made famous by legendary voice actor Donald LaFontaine). The movie also revolves around the desire of the competing voice-over actors to take over that line (and landing one trailer that would allow them to do so). The film co-stars Rob Corddry, Demetri Martin, Ken Marino, Michaela Watkins, Fred Melamed and Nick Offerman. It's an impressive performance by Bell on all fronts! Bell stars as Carol, a vocal coach who stumbles upon a big break in to the movie voice-over acting world. Her father, Sam Soto (Melamed). is a veteran in the business who's now retiring. When a popular book series is going to be turned into a probable blockbuster film franchise the first film trailer is heavily sought after, especially because it will bring back the popular trailer line 'In a world'. Soto wants his friend, and likely successor, Gustav Warner (Marino) to land the gig but when Gustav gets laryngitis Carol is asked to record a temp track instead. Her recording is so good that the producers want her for the trailer instead and a heated competition begins.The movie is funny and touching in just the right places. All of the characters are written and acted well and I didn't even get into the plot line involving Carol's sister and her husband (Watkins and Corddry). They're part of the movie was actually the most touching to me but the main storyline is an interesting and entertaining subject for a movie (and one that hasn't been used much before, that I've seen). Bell show a lot of talent not just as an actress but as a writer and director as well (now). Certainly she's not just another pretty face!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UY2UtXfI_w",negative
In a World...,"A friend invited me to a Sundance USA event in San Francisco, where they take 10 films from the festival and show them in different cities around the US. I had no idea what the movie was even about, and obviously no expectations.I was completely blown away. 'In a World' was one of the funniest, cleverly-written and flawlessly edited movies I've seen this year (2012-present). From Demetri Martin, Rob Cordry and Lake Bell herself, the acting was fantastic. I had seen Lake Bell in 'How to Make it in America' and thought she was great, but I had no idea how unbelievably talented she is (i.e. playing an accent- obsessed speech coach/aspiring voice-over actress who does probably 10+ flawless accents throughout the movie...a movie she wrote and directed as well. No big deal).I'm not sure if this movie is getting distributed to a wider audience, but I'm grateful my friend convinced me to go. If you have a chance to catch this, it's a must-see.",positive

Think Like a Man Too,Review: I really liked this movie because it shows you that even though Las Vegas is extremely Gotti there is still romantic places you could consider for marriage. The couples including a former player and his current girlfriend who almost steal the show away from everyone else because of his reputation and she having to do damage control. A newly divorced man who thinks he is a player. This cast of characters is perfect to have been roaming around Las Vegas. The director and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. There are some really funny moments such as the guys going to the strip club for amateur night and the girls being the audience. The in jail moment feels as real as it gets based on the couples behaving poorly in the strip club. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.,positive
Suck Me Shakespeer,"Like so often I ask myself how a bad movie can reach a good voting here and a good movie a bad voting. Of course tastes are different but this is exaggerated. This movie doesn't only have a bad story line, it has even worse acting actors. 90% of acting is done by ppl shouting around angry in a childish fake annoying way and behaving like everyone is uebercool. Especially the mainactor is awful. I've seen for sure over 1000 movies in my lifetime and I can say this one is in the top 10 of the worst. I prefer a ueberlow-budged movie which for sure can reach a better quality than this one. I hope this junk wasn't translated in other languages since there are a lot of other German movies which deserve to be translated first.",negative

Bala,"I don't get why they couldn't hire someone with dark skin to play a dark-skinned person's role. It completely takes you out of the movie when Latina's skin colour is inconsistent through out the movie. I have hundreds more complaints about this movie but it is just annoying me to think about it. Don't see this extremely lame film.The Bala character is such a vain person that it is extremely difficult to connect with him at any level. The man only cares about his looks and nothing else. In fact the man has no identity in his film except his bald head. Every character in this movie is one dimensional and defined only by their looks or something that will serve a completely useless purpose in the movie. Bala is his bald head, Latika is her dark skin and Pari is Tik Tok.They want to tell you that looks are not important and yet they underestimate humanity. We are not in the age anymore where people look at bald people and find it funny. Nobody sees a person's wig come off and immediately starts guffawing. Nobody does that.Don't waste your time with this film.",negative

Barefoot,"so this is actually the second time i watch something for Scott Speedman, the first time i'v watched him was in the Underworld movies when he was serious guy vampire /wolf .. but he really fits in these kinda romance-comedy movies ,, the movie had its moments , some highs and lows ,, the plot is good and new and heartwarming. the script is written in a good way , no complications on following the events. you know when you watch a movie and you feel happy , smiling in a weird way in the end , yeah .. that's one of those. The story itself starts slow and there is some missing ideas and it's not that Hilarious ,, but it still felt nice . the casting was so good. so i think overall the movie worked out pretty well.",negative
Barefoot,"Jay Wheeler (Scott Speedman) lives up to his name as a wheeler-dealer. A son of wealthy New Orleans stock, he has chosen to run up gambling debts and pursue other nefarious actions. This lands him in jail, where he is sentenced to community service at a mental hospital. While mopping the floors, he saves a pretty patient, Daisy (Evan Rachel Wood) from being assaulted by a male resident of the same ward. Not long after this, his gambling totals are so large that the casinos are after him. His only recourse is to go back home for his brother's wedding, where he will ask his father for a ""business loan"". But, needing to look the part of a successful gentleman, Jay decides he needs a lady on his arm. All of the pole dancers of his acquaintance turn him down so he gets the brilliant idea to bring DAISY, after she follows him out the door one night. Is he serious? Yes, she's highly functional but may have killed her mother, also a disturbed individual. With instructions to tell everyone she is a nurse, can Daisy and Jay pull this ruse off? Not likely, and soon other escapades follow. Meanwhile, the hospital's head shrink (JK Simmons) is throwing fit after fit. Is there a future for this strange couple? This remake of a German film has a great concept and a winning performance from Wood to elevate its eventual loss of energy. What fun to have a ""crazy"" woman pose as a gal pal at a high society wedding! Speedman does fine work, too, as do Treat Williams, Simmons, Kate Burton and more. As the scenery goes from California to Louisiana to Texas and back again, fans of varied venues will be happy, too. Yes, the flick slows down and loses focus in the second half but still will resonate with a certain kind of offbeat film lover. So, if that's you, get shoes on and go get Barefoot.",positive
My Life as a Zucchini,"Whenever I review a Stop-motion animated film, I always start with by saying it is a dying art form that needs a bigger lift from us. It gave a new life for filmmaking when there were no technology like computers hundred years ago for the creation of giant creatures to all the fantasy and magical world. I am glad that every year someone coming forward to show the world how beautiful these are.I think there's a quota for it and 2D animation for the Oscars. Otherwise, these formats would die sooner than we expected, so that recognition in the big stage. Every year at least one film from these two categories makes out. This year it was a double jackpot for Stop-motion animation. Including this, 'Kubo and the Two Strings' was the other one to shine in the world's biggest film awards ceremony. But winning the trophy is almost impossible in this 3D animated film world. Anyway, I'm happy for this, that I enjoyed watching it.It was a short film, that ran for just one hour. First, we have to understand filmmaking in this form is a most challenging one than any other. It is a manual work. I mean people get in there and frame by frame do all the work. So for this one hour film, they had done the great hard work and it paid off well by got nominated for the Oscars. It was also Switzerland's official submission for the Best Foreign Language Film, but failed to make progress in that race.The screenplay was based on the book. A simple story with a strong message. This is the tale of a boy with full of dreams and after his alcoholic mother died, he is taken to the orphanage. That is the last place he wanted to be where he meets a mean boy and soon becomes his close friend. Being young kids, they tend to play some pranks with officials, visitors and themselves. That's one of the ways to cope with for where they have ended. So the remaining is to tell us would they get a second chance in their lives.❝I don't know why I'm crying. Sometimes people cry because they're happy.❞When some take up a project like this, they are not offered to make mistakes in choosing a weak screenplay. Because there are thousands of films in production around the world and in those, a handful of animated films, but probably he's only one up for a Stop-motion animated feature. Which means everyone with the knowledge of his commitment will be looking forward to it. So the filmmakers have opted to adapt a novel, which is always a best option in filmmaking.The next is the characters. Making them come alive, particularly initial stage, the creation of models. Yep, they have done that job as well so well. Gooding looking ones, especially among the kids for having similarity with their vision. The frame rate was good. Very smoother for viewing. So technically it was a flawless for the normal watch. An impressive storyline, which might serve as a tearjerker for a few.There's a little romance, but from the children's perspective of having a crush. Since the girl character was introduced, the narration takes a fresh look. The following event becomes even more adventurous and fun filled till the end. The voice-over was excellent. From the dialogues to the film scenes very impressive. It marks the directional debut for a short filmmaker. An appreciable work and I hope he makes more like them with new technics than migrating to computer animations.One of the advantages is it is a short and sweet film, but those who love such films might feel it is too short. Most importantly, there're not clichés like what we've seen films that takes place in the orphanages. The opening was shocking. If it was a real life, the boy would have ended in a different place. Still the emotional parts were less explored, yet very convincing for not leaning too much on that facet.The film is one of the best in its kind, but I agree it's not a masterpiece. Not if you have seen plenty of Stop-motion animations in your life. Yet it can't be neglected that easily and surely it is for everyone. I know there are folks who thinks this format of films are for little ones, but the truth is they are still in the pre 90s mindset. This is good, give it a try and you might love it. Anyway, for its rareness itself highly recommended, then you decided how do you liked it or not.7/10",negative
My Life as a Zucchini,"It's easy to dismiss an animated film like this that deals with the themes that this does. The film's quality, however, goes a long way towards making us realize that running time doesn't dictate how good something is. This film is short, but it packs a punch. One of its biggest strengths is that it doesn't try to fill up the running time or try to do many other turns in the storyline. It's very, very simply but as a result its themes are clearer than many other animated films' themes. It's handled with delicacy and subtlety. It's an incredibly strong film that I recommend.",positive
Cuban Fury,"CUBAN FURY is yet another British comedy that isn't very funny. The concept - a workplace love triangle in which our portly hero has to return to his childhood love of salsa in order to win over the hot new American manager from his obnoxious co-worker - is sound but the jokes are too few, the direction is generic and, in a film which is all about dancing, it's all too obvious that Nick Frost as the lead can't actually dance very well. Among the supporting cast Ian McShane is nicely seedy and Kayvan Novak steals the show as a camp Persian fellow-dancer, but there's not enough of them and too much of Nick Frost being clumsy and Chris O'Dowd being a jerk.",negative
Cuban Fury,"After a terrible bullying experience, Bruce Garrett (Nick Frost) has now become an ego-deflated, self-loathing, trapped as a wallflower young engineer who lost all hopes of ever being in love with his only escape is eating at Nando's take-outs. When the arrival of his new boss, an American named Julia (Rashida Jones), his lease on life turns for the better. However, he does feel worthy enough to win her love. His dominant male colleague named Drew (Chris O'Dowd) naturally steps up to the plate to win her heart. Within a twist of irony, she has a very true passion for a man who could dance, particularly salsa dancing, which he is master in that craft. Bruce gets drawn back to the inner demons that has been haunting him for a long time. But through trail and error along with some persuasion from his sister Sam (Olivia Colman), Bruce must regain the dancing skills he once perfected and to try to the win the heart out of Julia up on the dance floor.If you've seen the 1993 ""Strictly Ballroom"", you'll simply enjoy ""Cuban Fury"", a film that juxtaposes the romantic comedy romp along with the art of salsa dancing to keep you both entertained while you hum to the music as the dancing will come after you something fierce. The movie like ""Strictly Ballroom"", has its share of intriguing characters that are both humorous and very effective in their actions and the dialogue. Television director James Griffiths in his movie debut antes up the charm factor with two great performers like Nick Frost and Chris O'Dowd who's charismatic nature about them never keeps the story from becoming mundane. To those who love salsa dancing may sit still on their seats as Frost and O'Dowd will melt your heart in amazement as they will compete against each other and will dance their hearts out as a way to reach their goals to win the heart of Julia. In the in it isn't Bruce or Drew that's the winner, but for the dance enthusiast, it's the audience that's the winner. By the time we get introduced to Nick Frost's character, a bulbous, loner of a man who's now a high-ranking industrial machinery designer who was a salsa dancer expert was haunted 22 years ago from a legion of bullies were on the prowl who made him swallow his costume sequins. But his desire to dance returns once his new boss, Julia enters his life who has a fascination for salsa. A memorable scene was when they were in the corridor and their name tags magnetize together was quite precious. What's also hilarious is that her name is Julio. The real scene stealer is Chris O'Dowd as Bruce's rival who also has the hots for Julia, Drew. He's a jerk who likes to tell dirty jokes and makes seductive passes towards Julia.But it's not just Bruce, Julia and Drew that carry the whole movie. We have Kayvan Novak as Bejan who's also a salsa impresario who encourages Bruce to shave his chest hairs, get a superficial tan and to purchase a silk tan. Olivia Colman who plays Bruces's sister Sam persuades him to relinquish from his comfort zone and takes him to a tavern and gives him some shots where she works while sporting a Polynesian call-girl uniform. Rory Kinnear who plays Bruce's friend Gary who's confused by the situation involving Bruce and Bejan. There's a plethora of great scenes involving Burce and his former salsa dancing coach, Ron Parfitt played by Ian McShane as he get him to regain a talent he lost as he had the ""legs of a stallion and the arms of an eagle"". McShane has great depth along with compelling facial expressions which flows along the film quite nicely. The principal leads are virtually sublime and this film is a dynamic underdog story as Frost tries everything to overcome his inner demons to dazzle us with his one hidden talents with his supreme salsa moves which will likely melt your heart like a hot knife through butter. Jones is quite superb as her natural beauty and charm she's in the middle of Bruce and Drew's competitive ways to win her approval. Watch for a cameo from Simon Pegg in a memorable scene in a parking lot where Bruce and Drew are competing against each other showing off their salsa dancing skills. The climax is very exciting as the two rivals compete on the dance floor and is backed by wonderful music and the adrenaline pulsing sound of the crowd as the heart pounds while the rhythms to the sound will likely sweep you off your feet. You never know this movie may inspire you to want to learn the art of salsa dancing.",positive

The Brand New Testament,"God, a self-hating alcoholic who treats His wife with contempt, spends his time programming new rules for existence to annoy, torture and frustrate His creation - humanity.While His son (J.C) attempted to change to his cruel reign he failed. It is now the turn of God's daughter Ea to end Humanity's suffering - which she does by informing the world of the exact amount of time they have left to live and then returning to Earth to find 6 more Apostles and to write an all new Testament.Sadly, however while the premise is full of promise, the cast generally good and the cinematography OK, it is just not that funny, clever or satisfying. The film has energy, ideas and a certain charm but just cannot make it work it ends up a bit of a mess to be honest.This film has three obvious problems; 1) Major identity problems: The film starts off in a Jean-Claude Jeunet style (think Amélie), but just not quite as clever, lacks pace and is frankly only mildly amusing.Sadly, the comedy becomes more infrequent and the tone switches to serious drama for certain elements, then back to comedy, some philosophical musing, a ton of sex but then decides to drown itself in the surreal. So surreal in fact that the film loses its audience (the Gorilla scenes) as the pacing gets worse and the script is thrown in the bin.The schizoid nature of the film ruins it - the strong narrative set up in the first 20-30 minutes of the film is thrown out of the window along with the humour.This film could have been a great comedy about God, existence etc, instead it just becomes an undefinable mess, not really funny, not really thought provoking and not really very entertaining.It ends bewilderingly with a scene that does not make any sense even within the loose rules for narrative that the film sets itself.2) A very hit and miss script: Simply put if you do not like surrealist humour then you will hate this film.Reflections about God, life, existence and death are treated super seriously or joked about - it has some funny observations but these are exhausted half way in and later jokes are not very amusing aside from maybe 1 or 2.The script is at times cringe-makingly preachy - full of pseudo intellectual/philosophical musings that go nowhere and sometimes feel like a first-year university student's drunken ramblings, for example the All New Testament scene on the beach makes light of the whole premise of the film as the Apostles laugh at their quotes - not really very funny.It then just becomes embarrassing (poor Deneuve and the Gorilla). The script just does not hit any nails on the head and in my opinion because the film does not know what it wants to be half of the time.3) An obviously limited budget: This is least of the films problems but the digital effects which are used sparingly throughout are at times awful (the starling scene for example) The end scene effects are even worse.Conclusion Overall a very disappointing, pseudo-philosophical mess of a film - not really thought-provoking or leaving the cinema-goer with any kind of message. It fails because it does have not enough budget for Jean Claude Jeunet style visuals, is not nearly as funny as say Monty's Pythons Meaning of Life or Life of Brian, nor is it surreal enough to be truly memorable. Watch on TV on a rainy day if you have nothing better to do.",negative
The Brand New Testament,"This is a fantasy, black comedy. Jesus Christ's kid sister Ea is living with their dad, God, and their mum, Goddess, in a city apartment in Brussels in the present day. She is sick of God's cruel and violent ways and at age 10, puts an end to it by freezing his computer and fleeing the apartment into the city.Her last act before sabotaging her evil Dad is to text everyone with their date of death as her father, God, has fated it. This causes first a media storm, then great changes in the world and for individuals now certain of the imminence or otherwise of their mortality.It is a wild romp as young Ea sets out with a homeless man as a scribe to find another half dozen disciples to add to her big brother's twelve, and write The Brand New Testament based on details of ordinary people's lives.It is more whimsical and generous than blasphemous, but still, atheists will be as thrilled as believers will be enchanted, by the new apostles.The storytelling is exquisite; Amelie-esque might be the best description of the style. Elaborately constructed frames of short bursts of gorgeous, surreal elements pepper the action to ensure that this movie is a very rare delight.Gloriously inventive, coherent, hilarious, metaphysical, philosophical, big-hearted, and satisfying. This is 5 star entertainment for 15 and up.Andrew Bunney, Let's Go To The Pictures, Three D Radio, Adelaide",positive

Just Before I Go,"This was a sweet romantic comedy, with a bit a sadness thrown in, which should have been rated at least a strong 7 on IMDb...The story and script is right out of real life and Courtney Cox must be proud of her first directorial effort...She even had her ex David Arquette in the film.But, the big surprise was Seann William Scott, who after an over the top role in ""Goon,"" comes back with a low key sensitive performance miles away from ""American Pie"" or ""Dude Where's My Car.""

Luckily for him distractions and romance gives him a change of heart.Yet the film also rests on a strong supporting cast...Olivia Thirlby, Garreth Dillahunt,Kate Walsh and even the 50s teen queen Connie Stevens are there to help Scott's character.This is nice feel good film that deserves good distribution.",negative

It's a dark comedy drama with some smutty but funny humour that will either have you laughing out loud or looking on in shock. This movie is not only great acting, writing and directing but it has many hidden messages in it which makes you think about your own life, family amongst other things. Acting wise this is Sean William Scott's best movie. I cannot recommend this enough and I hope it gets the recognition it deserves.

The Starving Games,"A few weeks ago, upon discovering known and universally panned parody filmmakers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer were making a parody of the popular franchise The Hunger Games, I sent out a message on Twitter I thought would be seen as encouraging to some. It read, ""Encouragement to young filmmakers: whatever you're writing now is infinitely better than the new parody film The Starving Games. Soon after sending the tweet, I received a reply from the film's official Twitter reading, ""Great! We're working on The Starving Games 2!"" The fact that the PR/marketing campaign for the picture needs to reply in a smarmy way to negative feedback online about their film shows about as much maturity on their part as the film at hand. Unsurprisingly, The Starving Games is another miserable endeavor of a parody movie, directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the same men who have brought you Date Movie, Epic Movie, Vampires Suck, among other installments of the dead parody genre. That's right, I'm referring to the genre as dead now. Consider my reviews of A Haunted House and Movie 43 (which I'll throw in the same genre since it revolves around many self-referential skits and lampoons A-list actors) the genre's funeral service and this one a visit to its gravesite. What has happened to a genre so promising and so filled with life? The simple answer is it has been reduced to what appears to be a cinematic competition between writers to incorporate as many pop culture and movie references in one film as possible. In the first few minutes of The Starving Games, we are annihilated as viewers by the abundance of references thrown at us, as if it's a commercial break on Television in mid-December and we're trying to decide on what toy to buy our children. The Friedberg and Seltzer formula is to have no continuity, no logic, and no wit in their story. Just clobber together every successful film character, pop culture icon, current celebrity, etc into roughly eighty minutes and string it along with a loose plot and hope someone laughs (or enough sales come through to cash a large check).As inferred by the title, the film is one long parody of the popular book/film franchise The Hunger Games, with the protagonist of Katniss Evergreen now under the name ""Kantmiss Evershot,"" an inept archer who now must fight for her life in the game where her and another opponent must kill one another in The 75th Annual Starving Games. The winner receives an old ham, a coupon for a foot-long sub sandwich, and a partially eaten pickle. The person who sits through this film in its redundant, eighty minute glory gets nothing but a shorter amount of time left in their day.With all the disgustingly unfunny references, I'm glad this film was shot, edited, and completed before Miley Cyrus and the ""twerking"" phenomenon became mainstream. If I had to witness something of that caliber in a film that already breathlessly tries to include the ""Gangnam Style"" musician Psy, the whole Avengers squad, Harry Potter and his friends (who are told to get out of the film because their franchise has ended), and the cast of action movie legends from The Expendables, I would've probably given up.The reason why I resist discrediting or shattering the likely large egos of directors Friedberg and Seltzer is because, well, why bother? They have found a formula that pays big money and have capitalized off of the lowest common denominator of wit and intelligence there is in the cinematic world. I am anticipating reviews of The Starving Games that consist of death threats, comments about the devolution of humor because of the directors' films, and remarks of their worthlessness because of their filmography. Reviews of their films have become as predictable as the films they make, so why bother attacking them? All I can say is be grateful this one is confined to a video-on-demand released and a very limited theatrical release, as opposed to their other films which garnered wide releases. Let's hope their window of release just becomes smaller and smaller over time.The Starving Games and films like it don't make me angry anymore. They just make me sad. It makes me upset to see films like these gain an audience of young teens who are already experiencing shorter attention spans thanks to Television and the internet. I'd let my twelve year old child watch the original Halloween before a film by Friedberg and Seltzer. Or, better yet, the original Airplane! or The Naked Gun series, both starring the gifted comedy actor Leslie Nelson. Those films worked because they spoofed their own genres and didn't try to incorporate every current celebrity and movie figure that has rose to prominence since their last film. There is no reason anyone should see The Starving Games, but, oh, people will.Run and tweet that.Starring: Maiara Walsh, Brant Daugherty, and Cody Christian. Directed by: Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer.",negative
The Starving Games,"I don't really understand what people expect to find when they decide to watch movies like this. I do know what I can expect, because they are always the same. If you like this type of ridiculous, non-intelligent, dirty comedy, good. If not, why do you bother?I had a good few laughs with this movie, and it entertained me more than other films that apparently are great (see pacific rim). This movie is not pretentious nor tries to amuse you with new, all fantastic jokes. It doesn't need much budget and it's something I appreciate. It's also better than other predecessors such as Disaster Movie or Epic Movie (those were actually quite bad). As I said before: if you like the Scary Movie saga and related spoof movies, go for it.Now, 10 is probably a bit overrated, but I can't stand the 3 or so score that this movie shows at the moment, while other trash is in the 7s range.I expect a lot of clicks on the NO button regarding if this review was useful to you. Please, be my guest, I wouldn't have it any other way. The day I am loved by the masses will be the day that I start rating movies like twilight with a score of over 5.",positive
Housebound,"I had high hopes for this horror/comedy movie based off the reviews I've read. Usually, I don't know many successful horror/comedy movies, but the one's that are good, are quite rare. The beginning of this movie was entertaining and funny, I thought the whole movie was going to be like this, but I was wrong. It never really ""took off"" for me. In the middle of the movie, only a few things that happened that was considered funny, and there were slight jump scares; besides that, it was pretty boring. It wasn't until near the end of the movie when the entertainment picked back up.I was watching this with my friends and family and none of them enjoyed it, some even fell asleep. Personally, this movie was just okay. I wish it was more funnier, but I found myself most of the time- just waiting for something to happen. Don't get me wrong, this movie wasn't bad, and I thought it had huge potential.Some people may enjoy it, but I found it pretty slow half way into the movie.",negative
Housebound,"After the endless, mind numbing, clichéd, regurgitated rubbish one has to sift through these days, just hoping to find something truly enjoyable and a bit original; stumbling across this great little gem returns my faith a bit. It's great to be reminded that fresh and inspired ways of telling a story ARE still out there! It may be harder to find them now, but when you do, it's like a breath of fresh air to a movie lover like myself.There are only two movies to have done this for me very recently, ""NO ONE LIVES"" and now, HOUSEBOUND. Although two very different movies, it's the fresh and entertaining take on the genre that really stands out. It proves once more that you don't need famous actors, big directors or massive budgets;just talented vision and good story telling.For what it was trying to achieve within the genre, HOUSEBOUND was a perfect film for me. I laughed, I cringed, I was intrigued,I cared about what happened to all the relevant characters and the production quality was good. The Kiwi's don't do it often,but when when they do, they do it well. I won't say anything more about it, just watch it and see for yourself.I hope to see more from this film maker in the future!",positive
Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas,"This movie is so, so utterly wretched, not only in its execution but also in its conception.Just from a filmmaking perspective, it's extremely shoddy. Many portions look like home movies. A large part of the film is Cameron sitting in a car talking to a friend, and that's not interesting to watch. ""Comedy"" scenes have nothing to do with the rest of the story, and are creepily unfunny. A bizarre dance scene at the end is out of place and seems inserted to extend the time. Cameron's presence here is smarmy and smug; he lays out his spiritual views and his friend just gushes about how right Cameron is and how he's helped him see the light and love Christmas and all that. A bigger problem is the misinformation that Cameron spews so authoritatively, some of which runs counter to the Bible and to known history. To give a partial list:Cameron claims that Joseph and Mary were hiding from soldiers sent by Herod to kill all babies being born. But the Gospel of Matthew says the soldiers were sent by Herod AFTER Jesus was born, when Herod was tipped off by the visiting Wise Men that a King of the Jews had been born. Joseph and Mary then took Jesus and did the Flight into Egypt to save the child's life.Cameron insists the Nativity took place in a cave because the manger was made of stone. No source claims the manger was stone, or that the Nativity took place in a cave. Matthew says it was in Joseph's house in Bethlehem, Luke says it was a stable. This seems like a post-hoc attempt to link the Nativity with the Resurrection.Cameron says frankincense and myrrh were ""funeral spices."" Although myrrh had been used in Egyptian mummification, frankincense was not, and both were much more commonly used as a sacred incense in Hebrew temples.He goes into detail about Saint Nicholas' life, presenting it as fact, but in truth very little is known for sure about him, and some Christian leaders openly suggest that he may never have existed. All that is known for sure is that someone named Nicholas was at one point the Bishop of Myra; everything else is unsure and in the territory of legend and myth.Legend has it that during the Council of Nicaea, Nicholas angrily struck Arius in the face for saying that Jesus and God were separate. Cameron depicts Nicholas savagely and brutally attacking Arius and beating him with a shepherd's crook, a scene many Christians found objectionable.Cameron depicts the historical Saint Nicholas climbing on a sleigh to deliver presents to children, something he never did in any legend. He also claims that Saint Nicholas is the gift-giver everywhere, also not supported by history. Some areas give gifts on Christmas, others at Epiphany, others on St. Nicholas' day, and in some areas the gifts are delivered by someone else entirely, such as La Befana in Italy, St. Basil in Greece, the Yule Lads in Iceland, St. Lucy in Croatia, and multiple countries have the gifts delivered by the Magi, angels, or the Christ Child himself. Cameron says Nicholas was ""sainted,"" when in reality Nicholas was never canonized. His sainthood was more by word-of-mouth.Cameron makes an elaborate rationalization for Christmas trees relating to the crucifixion and to the Garden of Eden; this connection is very convoluted and labored, and doesn't hold water. And he doesn't address the parts of Jeremiah which some feel are a commandment against Christmas trees.He claims that gifts piled under the Christmas tree are perfectly acceptable as they are reminiscent of the skyline of Jerusalem. By that reasoning, they could also be the skyline of Babylon or Rome, and could represent oppression and slavery. It's a poorly considered analogy that should never have been included.I'm sure I'm missing other bits, but I'm not inclined to go back and watch it again. It's unsettling to see Cameron stand and claim that it's OK to be materialistic at Christmas, because that's when God came to the Earth in material form. (That's pretty much a direct quote.) Never mind the many passages where the Bible tells us to set aside worldly things and not be materialistic! He exhorts viewers to eat themselves to bursting and buy the biggest ham and the richest butter....but isn't gluttony considered a deadly sin?At no point does he address such issues as helping the poor, feeding the hungry, giving to charity, volunteering, or anything. One is left with the impression that one should only think of one's self and one's immediate family and friends. Does Cameron remember Jesus' command to his followers to give away all they had to the poor? Somehow, I don't think so.Cameron gives the impression of someone who read parts of the Bible long ago, but rather than fit his life to the Bible, he is fitting the Bible to the life he wants to lead, and making one justification after another without ever bothering to double-check if he's remembering it correctly, or if there's something in the Bible that disagrees with him. It's clear he considers himself a better Christian than you. Many of the faithful have been turned off by this movie, some even going so far as to declare it blasphemous and call Cameron a false prophet. I'm not so sure I would agree, but at the same time, this movie does have some value of showing how even a faithful Christian can fall victim to the sins of pride and arrogance. It's clear that Cameron's ego was in overdrive, and this movie is not as much a testament to God as it is an expression of Cameron's arrogance.",negative

Pad Man,"I admit that the concept is innovative...but the execution is mediocre; and on the top of that comes over - ""Indianization"" which makes you really wonder whether this is actually a movie based on a 21st century incident...This movie should have been released in Doordarshan first, because rural people must see this movie first...Positives: -(1) Akshay Kumar's natural acting
(2) Beautiful songs like Aaj Se Teri
(3) Occasional humour and satiresNegatives: -(1) First half of the movie

Pad Man,"First and foremost a big round of applause to every single entity (Actors ,producers,director,writer,cameraman) who are associated with this real life inspired piece of lifetime reality .
Akshay kumar has acted flawlessly and setting another milestone for himself by acting as a rigid man who does not give up his dream even after multiple failures and malign and turns from a ""Badman to padman"".Being a woman it was more easier to connect to each and every action of the protagonist such as testing the pad on his own(by pumping animal blood) was the most touching scene which made me cry while watching.It gives me goosebumps while I think about the real hero Mr Lakshmikant.A jumbo hats off to him from the core of my heart and mind. Rest all have also played their part very responsibly and successfully. 
This piece inspires to dream about every small and untouched but inevitable needs of life associated with human being(Irrespective of caste creed and gender).
I will not go very far to proof this as I always wanted to write a review on movies and this is the movie which forced me to write the review right after coming back from theatre. Though this story makes more sense to developing and underdeveloped countries like India where chums is still a taboo to talk about still the movie deserves a nomination for Oscar in regional film category in the year of 2018.",positive
Dom Hemingway,"From the first moment of the movie when we are 'treated to a rambling monologue from Jude Law using the type of extravagant language no self respecting gangster would use the tone is set. Dom Hemingway is a character that could have been interesting and engaging but Jude Law too often over acts catastrophically converting his performance from amusing to embarrassingly 'hammy' on far too many occasions. His relationship and interaction with Richard. E. Grant's Dickie character provides some of the highlights of the movie but the under use of the relationship and dialogue between these characters was bizarre. Far too little character depth or development is provide and as such by the end I didn't really know or care about who Dom Hemingway really was or what happened to him. Worst of all the relationship with Dom's estranged daughter Evelyn played by Emelia Clarke was an almost non-existent narrative strand when in reality it could and should have been a cornerstone of the story, the result of the mere suggestion of a father and daughter reconciliation story was so under developed and under used that what the film actually provides is a rather pathetic. The story of a daughter abandoned by an imprisoned father due to his adherence to a 'criminal code' could, should and would have provided a worthy central storyline on which the rest of the film could rest, sadly in this case it didn't.Dom Hemingway as a character and movie falls well short of what it could have been, essentially the movie storyline is:- criminal goes to jail for 12 years for honouring a 'criminal code', comes out talking line an extremely angry Royal Shaspearan actor with a cockney accent, gets drunk gets more angry, shouts and swear with , to or act old friends, in passing remembers he has a daughter that he wishes to reconcile with kind of doesn't The End. Style over substance very disappointing.",negative
Dom Hemingway,"I had not intended to watch Dom Hemingway. I never heard about it before it came on while I was tuned to HBO. But its opening scene is hard to ignore. A man in a prison is standing naked while someone (out of the camera view) is giving him a blow job, while the prisoner, who announces that he is the great Dom Hemingway, waxes poetically about the greatness of his cock. Once hooked I couldn't stop watching. Throughout the film Dom speeches have a Shakespeare-like quality about them, not realistic perhaps but fascinating language. I was mesmerized by Jude Law's performance.The plot involves Dom serving 12 years in prison to protect his crime boss, and his odyssey in pursuit of the reward he feels is his due. Dom has anger management issues and is clearly admired by his fellow prisoners and feared by the civilians who know him. Melody is one of the hookers the crime boss rewards Dom with. Later in the film she reappears as a sort of angelic seer who helps him change his life and his luck. On his release from prison Dom meets up with an old friend, a criminal named Dickie, who sticks with Dom on his crusade to get his reward for his 12 year sacrifice. Dickie is played magnificently by Richard E. Grant, a British actor who looks a bit like a young Max von Sydow.",positive

Zashchitniki,"from the heavy handed introduction / title sequence involving unpleasant manipulation of Humans, I knew I was in for a treat. My viewing pleasure was massively enhanced by the appallingly translated subtitles, (talking about a daughter, saying ""he did this and died"" or something along those lines) The frequent, perplexing ""gazing at another's grief"" scenes with characters that looked as though they had all traces of expression CGI'd from their faces. News bulletins that looked as if the broadcasters didn't really know how serious all this might be. Arsus (the bear) seemed to be suffering some kind of existential crisis going on most of the time, even when he was a bear, and the grinning oaf that seemed to be the bad guy was fantastic, posturing with his hands in the air whilst manipulating his machines. So in all seriousness, one of the best / worst films I have ever experienced in my life of watching Really Bad science fiction films. and believe me this was Really Bad. Great Fun.",positive

The cheats are really thrilling, and time after time there are events that make your heart race.

If you like movies that has no script at all, and you like to smoke little bit of the green then this movie is perfect for you LOL.I have spoken to some of my colleagues about this movie and they agree with me and said ""what did I just watch!?""Don't spend you time watching this movie, I don't get it how this movie has a solid 7 out of a 10 here at IMDb.Thanks,Gunnar",negative

There is almost no plot and little to no football but who was watching the show for that part specifically? It was just a bunch of alcohol, drugs, girls, and sex; but that is kind of what to expect from a Blue Mountain State movie. Had a few laughs to die for throughout the movie and found myself genuinely satisfied at the end. So just to sum things up, please don't watch this movie in hopes of seeing a majestic art piece of a film because it's always raining cocaine in Thadland! 10/10 for any fan of the show.",positive

Shaun the Sheep Movie,"13 February 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester This Aftenoon - Shaun The Sheep. I would just like to point out that I was the only adult there without a child.....or maybe I was the only child without an adult!!!!!! Nick Park and his team have done it again. This was classic Aardman animation, with our old pal Shaun. Bored with his mundane life Shaun and his sheepy friends engineer a way to have a day off but all goes drastically wrong when the farmer ends up in the big city with memory loss. It's up to the animals to save him and what follows is a madcap series of events where nobody questions sheep dressed as humans or any of the antics that occur. Completely without dialogue the story is carried along by the excellent score and gesticulations and a gaggle of bleats, grunts and other indiscriminate noises. As we know animation these days caters for all ages and with various movie references included the adults were definitely laughing at different times to the children. Watching some good old stop motion animation is a very pleasant way to pass the time.",negative
Shaun the Sheep Movie,"I never ever go to the cinema (I rather wait for the Blu-ray to be released and just paying once but yet I went to London from Spain just to see this movie. I didn't wanna wait for it to be released here. Shaun the Sheep is a brilliant TV show so when I found out a movie was being made I was totally thrilled. Even though going from the 7-minute episode to a full length movie was a big step, I was confident in Aardman to made the transition easily. They didn't disappoint. First, let me say that I love stop-motion; it's such an ""intimate"" technique due to the fact that you always have to literally be on top of the character to change it every time he makes the slightest movement. But not only is the technique beautiful, the story doesn't disappoint either. This doesn't feel like a dragged out episode of the show, it feels like a story that goes beyond the usual surroundings of the show while still maintaining how everything works. This movie made me laugh a lot. If there's something that Shaun the Sheep always achieved was the ability to create humor of the most simplest situations. But I also cried a lot. Tears of sadness and happiness. And truthfully, I never expected Shaun the Sheep to reach me so deeply. There's a scene where you can see so much pain in Shaun eyes. And that's just clay! My God, congratulations to whoever did that, it was so moving. And I also had a sweet spot about Slip, the dog that Shaun meets early in the movie and come along for the adventure. She was a new character but she felt like and old member of the gang. I haven't enjoyed a movie so much in a long time. And I haven't felt so many thing with a movie in a long time either. So thank you, Aardman, for giving a fan such a great gift.",positive
Qu'est-ce qu'on a fait au Bon Dieu?,"Foolish, humorless,very bad acting,no real feeling, and at one point the sisters and their husbands do something horrible, seemingly totally out of character, but life goes on...Also our young couple reacts to problems in ways that make no sense...",negative
Qu'est-ce qu'on a fait au Bon Dieu?,"Christian Clavier is a comedy legend. It works as a guarantee that the film which he is starring in won't disappoint you. But I'm also glad that a film with this ensemble cast isn't just merely focusing on him and his comedy talent. Everybody in the film gets their spot to shine. Everybody has to deliver a great performance otherwise the film would collapse on itself. Especially the three sons-in-law have a great chemistry together and are extraordinary funny.The plot allows the writers and filmmakers to play with and discuss many important and serious issues, but to present in a humorous and way. Just imagine, that you as a parent of four daughters, get three sons of law with a different religion, ethnic background and not one of them get well with each other. You hope that the last daughter will bring you and ideal contender who meets you demands of a perfect man for your daughter.The French have always been masters at comedy although in the last couple of years that trend has lost a little bit of steam, but it seems to be going at full speed now. After the excellent international success of The Intouchables, comes another film which has a chance for an international recognition. While the main premise and issues may be a bit touchy for some people, every jab at someone be it from ethnic point or religious point can't insult anyone because that is not the point. The point of the humor is look back on the globalization and the problems our multicultural society brings.Relationships are made, men bond with each other but it is no way done in any pathetic way. From my experience this is exactly how things happen - the three sons in law become friends in sharing the goal of being liked the by the father of the family. They become friends in the childlike fashion. Or Clavier's Claude befriends the last rival standing in the way of her fourth daughter to have a happy marriage, by simply having the same hobby - fishing.With 90 minute runtime this comedy doesn't have any spare time to slow down. This is laugh out ride since the start until the finish. I can remember only a handful of times when I have experienced the entire theater to be laughing out loud like this. This is a perfect comedy with the perfect cast and premise.",positive
Alan Partridge,"As I watched this on my trip to London and have no previous connection to Alan Partridge I cannot judge this against the series, as another reviewer has done already (at least). I can say that I like Steve Coogan a lot, which was one of the main reasons I wanted to see it. And he is a very funny guy. The premise itself has some very funny moments indeed, though it sometimes goes sour in a heartbeat (for all the wrong reasons that is).The movie is somewhat based in reality, but it's an Alan Partridge reality. Still there are too many things that are convenient and most of it is really predictable. Weren't it for the charm of the lead actors and their playing of the roles, I think many more would notice that this runs out of steam quickly (story wise). The finale then is very weird (with police acting even weirder, passive/active wise that is) ... a shorter version would've been much appreciated.",negative
Alan Partridge,"Now let me get this straight. I'm not Alan Partridge. I didn't decide one Monday afternoon, while eating a double decker, to come on to IMDb and give a review. That would be illegal. Neither am I plugging double deckers. They're really nice though, and I reckon Jesus would probably eat them. I digress. Alpha Papa is amazing. Alan Partridge will surely get the Oscar nod for best actor. If you thought Brokeback Mountain was stunning (I didn't) then you'll bend over backwards to watch this. Alan doesn't play a gay cowboy, but rather a non-gay radio show presenter who ends up in a siege (sorry about the spoiler). And he doesn't die at the end either like Bruce Willis in Sixth Sense, or the dog in Bob Marley and Me. No, he lives after enduring what can only be described as an epic battle of man versus another slightly crazy man, who looks a bit like that bloke off Star Trek with the fake Irish accent. Anyway...don't waste your time watching Monsters University or the slightly camp Wolverine who has knives and forks for hands. Watch a real man in action giving the performance of his life.",positive
Nine Lives,"I saw the movie and I would like to comment on the storyline of ""Nine Lives."" I found it to be disturbing. I understand and accept that the cats in the Purr-kins shop were there voluntarily and that some - like Mr. Fuzzy Pants - apparently agreed to donate some of their lives in order to help ""troubled"" humans straighten themselves out. But when the cats were given away, they were soon ""possessed"" by the spirit of the humans that needed their help. The cats ceased to be cats altogether and the humans were trapped inside the cats. If the human possessing the cats could or would not reform, then the cats remained possessed and would be lost forever. If the human successfully reformed, the cats would have to die, in order to release the repentant humans' spirit. Mr. Perkins states that love requires sacrifices. The spirit of Mr. Brand flings the body of Mr. Fuzzy Pants off a skyscraper in a futile attempt to save his son. It is the cat who is sacrificed, not the human. The cat may have been attracted to the human initially, but there is never love between them. How can the death of the cat be considered a loving sacrifice? The way that this movie presents itself, cats are just vessels to be used by humans and discarded. For those reviewers that state that this movie is about a man who is turned into a cat, that is not correct: the poor cat is possessed by the spirit of a man and that spirit thinks and behaves like his human self throughout the possession. As a cat lover, I resented the treatment of the cats in this movie as mindless objects whose sole purpose was to correct bad human behavior; there was no regard for the cruel fate that they would have to face - no matter the outcome for the human possessing them. I'm sorry, but this is not the kind of film that could be written by or intended for people who love and admire cats.",negative
Nine Lives,"Why has this film been given such poor ratings? It is a lovely film, perfect for kids and adults alike. It is gentle, funny and charming. Visually it is a treat and the set designer deserves an award for producing such beautiful sets. Jennifer Garner never fails to charm and in this film and in this film she is perfectly matched with her little look alike daughter, Malina Weissman. Malina is perfectly cast and her future should be assured, based on her performance in this film. Cheryl Hines is very funny in her part of the ex-wife. Kevin Spacey is never my favorite actor, however he is perfectly cast as the self centered, uber successful business man, content to neglect his family. The film is funny with several laugh out loud moments. You don't have to be a cat lover to like the film but for those cat lovers out there you will recognize several famous cats. Overall it is a very enjoyable film. Go see it!",positive
Maggie's Plan,"New Yorker Maggie Hardin (Greta Gerwig) wants to have a baby. Her relationships never last more than six months except her college romance with best friend Tony (Bill Hader) but that doesn't count. She decides to get sperm from college acquaintance, pickle entrepreneur Guy Childers. She works at an art school with Tony's wife Felicia (Maya Rudolph) and John Harding (Ethan Hawke). Maggie and John meet over a paycheck mixup and start a relationship over a novel he's trying to write. He's unhappily married to Columbia professor Georgette (Julianne Moore) with two kids.The appeal of this movie depends a lot on one's appreciation of Gerwig's flighty, quirky persona. It's a rom-com where the romance is not the most likable. Harding starts off poorly and I never find him a good match for Maggie. Even the pickle guy is better although Tony could be the best if there is no Felicia. I'm actually glad at the turn in the second half of the movie and it becomes an anti-rom-com. The funniest relationship is between Maggie and Georgette. The movie could do with more of them together.",negative
Maggie's Plan,"Greta Gerwig as ""Maggie"" (an independent woman) bakes up a plan to become a single mother and in the process 'the plan' works but then backfires and puts her into a situation 'the plan' did not include - marriage.Gerwig gives a charming performance as Maggie steering a course through a relationship with a overly analytical writer once divorced husband, raising her three year old child, working her job as an instructor in a local college, and realizing her husband is still in love with his first wife! Maggie is in a pickle so she devises another plan!The setting is the New York City intellectual society living in row houses and meeting in cafe's to socialize. The cast includes Bill Hader, Ethan Hawke, Maya Rudolph, Julianne Moore, Wallace Shawn. This is a simple 'slice of life' type story about modern people looking for and finding happiness and direction in their life. It's probably a film more appreciated by a viewer that likes a romantic flavor in a story that looks into the feelings and emotion in the human spirit.This is a cheerful light story that includes just a touch of sorrow mixed into a picture of mostly happy people getting on with life. And don't forget the pickles!",positive
Queen,"I had high expectation from the movie as it was rated 9 on IMDb. Everybody praising the movie and I disliked the movie. I watched the movie twice just to make sure that I am not missing something. The story was straight forward and little different from others. That was the only thing I found good about Queen. I find that like many other bollywood movies, the director doesn't believe in logic. All the technicalities have gone for a toss. It includes all known jokes. I really do not understand Why people have liked the movie. The movie tries to show empowerment of a girl and how do they show it by simply lowering the standard to start with. A Delhi girl who is scared to cross streets in Paris ( was she not crossing much crowded streets in Delhi? ) , Speaks continuously in Hindi. Rukhrsar(Roxette) comes to Amsterdam to study because they had no money(BOLLYWOOD LOGIC). Every scene follows some cliché. Gol gappe scene, the web cam scene, the sex toys shop scene etc were too predictable. For me there was nothing extra-ordinary in movie.",negative
Queen,"QUEEN is directed by Vikas Bahl, starring Kangana Ranaut, in the lead role, along with Rajkummar Rao and Lisa Haydon.The film revolves around Rani (Kangana Ranaut), an innocent Punjabi girl, who gets dumped one day before her wedding day. She gets an idea to go on her honeymoon all by herself, and that very trip shows her road to self-empowerment while going through several comical situations...The trailer of Queen didn't quite attract much attention, therefore, the film was extremely underrated by several critics, including me. However, the songs did grab a portion of my attention, so I was curious to know whether I was looking at Queen from a wrong angle. The film, itself, faced fierce competition from Madhuri-Juhi starrer, Gulaab Gang and the much-awaited Total Siyapaa. However, the reviews came in for the three films, and I was shocked to see so much praise for Queen. So I decided to go with the critics and chose Queen over Total Siyapaa that weekend. And I think its safe for me to say that it is one of the best decisions I've made in my life (and it might be yours too).Queen starts off in the most mainstream desi way possible. The Big Fat Indian Wedding with relatives at every nook and corner and dance to Punjabi tunes is galore. The calling off of the wedding takes place and you feel yourself going through the very same events as Rani. This is due to pure direction and acting. However, the film takes a VERY sharp turn when she leaves for her honeymoon. Rani meets new friends, goes through life how a woman should, and I think it was a smart move on the director to release it on Women's Day, because at the end of the film, the message is pretty clear. However, I shall not go on further about the plot, because after she leaves India, its all just fun.The acting is just top-notch. Kangana Ranaut, in all honesty, carries the film on her shoulders throughout the 2h30m run time. She portrays her character with such finesse that she deserves awards and utter praise for it. Rajkummar Rao played a great job as well and the rest of the foreign actors were just delightful and splendid to see.The songs are great as well. Amit Trivedi also deserves applause for the great music as well as background score. Every single song captures a theme of the film and just blends perfectly with the several scenes in the film. It helps you feel like Rani while she goes through her journey. 'London Thumakada' captures the Indian Wedding Theme, while 'O Gujariya' is just great to listen to. A special mention about the remake of 'Hungama Ho Gaya' which is just complete fun to listen to.In conclusion, QUEEN is possibly one of the best films of the year. I can't seem to see any flaw in the film; it is just complete fun. Go watch it; I highly recommend it.QUEEN- 10/10",positive
Rams,"Just a week ago I saw 'Fúsi' which was about an overweight person with the mind of a child. And now another excellent Icelandic movie that centres on the livestock farmers. One of the best movie about the farmers I have seen. It is not all about their farms, but the love and dedication towards their work. About the art of raising animals that passed through the generations who never abandoned their ancestral village to look for a better life somewhere else. But what happens when suddenly a great threat pose to their way of life that they all only known. That's what this film talk about.This story is about two brothers Gummi and Kiddi, who have not spoken for decades. They live next door to one another in a remote village raising sheep. When one theirs ram wins a prestigious regional contest, that lead to discover a fear of scrapie epidemic, a disease that might wipe out their local breeds. After this incident, the conflict between the brothers escalates further. So what happens after the entire village lose their business to a viral infection brings a dramatic ending to the story.This is the advantage of watching world cinemas. You will get a chance to learn a different culture and other unfamiliar stuffs. Nowadays Hollywood is about big budget and superhero movies. Small scale films like this are very occasion, but I'm missing nothing through my love to films around the globe.I love realism films, but still this film gives a cinematic experience with the beautiful interior landscapes of Iceland. Most of the film takes place in the winter, but all the important outdoor sequences came prior to that season. Still the second half is the best part of the storytelling. After all Iceland without ice/snow is unimaginable.""If we've scrapie in the valley, we're screwed.""The story has a small twist in the halfway mark, that you could see it coming. But the third act was so awesome, because the pace picks up and brings the unexpected ending. Yet, I was little disappointed the way it concluded. I like the details, I don't always like understandable phrase in a film's ending. Those things are effective for the movies that going have a sequel. So what I meant is the end should have been a bit more specific about what actually happens. If it is about the brothers, not the livestock, then the theme is slightly misleading with all the developments.I was tempted to rate it close to maximum, like as I said the finale took away the fractions of my 'like' towards this wonderful drama. The lead actor from the 'Virgin Mountain' can be seen in a tiny role in a couple of scenes.I've heard the ram that acted in this called Garpur was credited, but it was not like any special performance. The movie was very slow, but I like this kind of narration when a story demands its own time to bring anything it wanted to tell on its own perfect way. There are scenes with some dark humours, so it is a semi tragicomedy.The initial parts, maybe the first act looks like an ordinary rural narration, but if you learn about the story and its character prior to your watch then you might feel comfortable with the pace. This film was sent to the recently concluded Oscars to represent Iceland, but failed to make into the ultimate round. Forget the American Academy Awards, this is still an excellent movie. I won't hesitate to suggest it to you all, it is a dull start, but you would feel worth watching it in the end.8/10",negative
Rams,"Rams is an Icelandic saga of the highest order, not of Kings, but of the Icelandic sheep farmer. There are battles, but the opponents are nature, the struggles of human relationship, and the hardships of life. It is a saga of and for the working man, expressed and pared down like a working man's haiku, and it is breathtaking. Beyond the story, it is a visual feast. The Icelandic landscape - seen in both its green glory and its stark white glory - literally made me gasp at first. The sound of the howling, relentless winter wind touched a primal nerve in me. And as someone who has co-existed with animals for much of my life, and who has worked on farms for years, I was touched by the aphorism that you can love - truly love - your animals, and then kill them and eat them. Killing something you love is not an easy thing to do of course, but Rams is a blast of reality in that way. Sustenance and survival in the real world, people. It's not always pretty, and never packaged. Rams is harshness and it is beauty, contrasting, colliding, and intermingling, like an Icelandic landscape and an Icelandic sheep farmer's life. Ten out of ten stars.",positive
Brigsby Bear,"5 minutes into this film and i thought it was a dull, quircky, offbeat comedy that i wouldn't resonate with. Half way through and i was laughing hard and really touched.
This is such a great film, it has been a while since i felt compelled to write such a review, but this film is just awesome.",negative
Brigsby Bear,"I know that tastes can't change overnight, but it's a shame that audiences can't gravitate more to movies like this. Films like this are very rare, due to the fact that they'll hardly ever snag a major release by a large studio. Not to compare the two, but last year's release of Swiss Army Man was so unique and weird that I ate it up, and I felt the exact same way about this year's Brigsby Bear, which could very well end up being my absolute favorite film of the year. Unique films are a breath of fresh air, but not all of them are great, because the stories themselves may not explore enough to truly warrant award recognition. Although Brigsby Bear won't be winning any major awards this season, here is why it's a wonderful piece of cinema in my eyes.From first-time feature film writer Kyle Mooney and direct time feature film director Dave McCary, Brigsby Bear follows James Pope, a young man with a backstory that I can't reveal throughout this review, who has only ever seen one television show, called Brigsby Bear. When there aren't any more episodes coming out, he sets out on a mission with a few others to finish the show themselves. Becoming a filmmaker, gaining new friends, and learning many moving and comedic life lessons, this is a story worth showcasing to a very large audience. Unique, weird, and powerful all at once, this movie is elevated by a wonderfully sincere and comedic performance by Kyle Mooney as the lead.It's very rare that a comedian can be simultaneously funny and dramatic at the same time, making it truly seem that this is a real-world scenario unfolding on-screen. Not only did this story feel authentic to me, but it touched me on a personal level in terms of how there would definitely be people like this if certain situations were to present themselves to the world. Mooney is an actor that I believe many people should keep an eye on. Sure, his YouTube career is where he started and he's most known for his role on Saturday Night Live, but he's one of those rare performers that I believe will break out and become very famous in years to come.I truly believe that this is a flawless film for the story it's trying to convey. No film is perfect, but a film can be done perfectly when looked at a certain way, and I believe film lovers and even filmmakers themselves will be the ones who love this film the most. Original ideas are slim to none throughout mainstream media nowadays, but I dare you to come up with a premise like this throughout the past ten years. Yes, there are always similarities in every story, but when a film can surprise you even in its first act, it's something special.In the end, Brigsby Bear is a perfect little indie film for fans of cinema, well-written, well-directed, calmly scored with care, and wrapped in a nice little bow of uniqueness. I found myself wanting to rewatch this movie the second it concluded. Although short and to the point at a mere 97 minutes, there are many hidden elements that will elevate the movie even more upon second and third viewings. I'm sure the fact that it's so weird will turn some audiences away from fully enjoying it, but like I said, hardcore film lovers and filmmakers of any kind are truly the ones that will most likely love Brigsby Bear. This is easily one of the best films I've seen all year.",positive
About Last Night,"This movie re-make was extremely disappointing. I'd been waiting to see this DVD for the last three months and I was really looking forward to it. I saw the '80s version with Demi Moore and Rob Lowe and I really enjoyed it. It is not a classic or even a cult film by any means, but it was entertaining and the acting was believable.This remake was horrible - the acting was flat with the exception of Regina Hall and even so, she was a little over the top as Joan. Kevin Hart was screechy (like Chris Tucker) and seemed to be doing a comedy stand-up routine throughout the movie rather than really getting into his character. Joy Bryant seemed to have phoned in her part and was by far the dullest character in the movie. The dog, Pacino, was more exciting than this Debbie. I've been a fan of Michael Ealy's for years, and I was taken by surprise that he didn't do more with his role. His relationship with Debbie was one-dimensional and there didn't seem to be any chemistry between Danny and Debbie at all. I didn't really care whether or not they got back together because it never seemed as if they had a relationship to begin with.",negative
About Last Night,"I attended a screening of the film a week prior to it opening in theaters. Will Packer, Kevin Hart and Regina Hall came to the theater to get viewers reactions that evening. ""About Last Night"" is the funniest, most realistic romantic comedy I've seen. However, be mindful of having a mouth full of beverage or food because Kevin Hart is hilarious in this movie and Regina Hall compliments him very well with her comedic acting. Both actors coming off of the heels of other recent successful movies (""Best Man Holiday"" for Hall and ""Ride Along"" for Hart) may make you assume that they gave their best performances already. But in my opinion, this was some of the best work I've seen from both actors. Michael Ealy is incredibly good to look at and a good actor as well, with a current TV show receiving good reviews and it's nice to see Joy Bryant on the big screen once again. Whether you're a couple or a single person, you will relate to these characters personally or know of someone in your life they remind you of. It doesn't matter what race you are either. Relationships and the emotions and issues that come with them are universal. I encourage you to see this movie and not just for Valentine's Day, but on any day.",positive
Knights of Badassdom,"This was one of the biggest let downs of recent memory. After reading all of the positive reviews, and seeing the incredibly high rating, I really thought I would be in for a treat. The movie wasn't funny, except for a few mild smiles here and there. The special effects, especially towards the end, were atrocious. And the characters were wooden with nothing brought to the screen. And the main premise for the demon was a cringe worthy rip off of the Necronomicon from Evil Dead. The movie has a incredible cast with Peter Dinklage, Summer Glau, Ryan Kwanten, and Steve Zahn. But unfortunately they totally failed to use almost any of their characters to their full (or any) potential. Ryan Kwanten was the only one who was even half way interesting. There were countless times that they could have made something humorous, or even hysterical, but instead it fell totally flat and was just bland. (Where was them humor after the games began and they set it up so obviously for Dinklage?!) I can understand fans of larping enjoying this film, as that unique aspect was the only half way saving grace of this snore-fest. But I can't imagine anyone else could even find it more than mildly entertaining. 3/10 stars and that's being generous.",negative
Knights of Badassdom,"I was extremely lucky to attend the world premiere! The screening was held at the ""Icon"" festival (sort of the Israeli version of comic-con) in Tel-Aviv, Israel. The screening began at midnight on the night of Sep. 24-25 2013. The movie was introduced by one of the producers. She got on stage, said a few words about the film and then dropped the bomb on all of us - This was the world premiere! The theater ERUPTED! Clapping and hooting for a good 2 minutes before she could keep on talking.What can I say? It was a theater packed with geeks and everyone went wild! the film is fantastic! The cast is brilliant and I laughed out loud at least 20 times (Even though on this page it doesn't say that the movie is actually a comedy - it totally is!). People were even clapping and cheering at many key moments. The feeling in the room was electric. We don't know which cut we got to see though, but it didn't feel too long - just right, in fact. Peter Dinklage is wonderful as usual and Summer Glau's performance - she was was fantastic. She is every geek's wet dream of course.. But she really delivered the whole ""I'm not really into this but I'm playing along with it"" role. She looked amazing in her costume! Her on screen chemistry with the other characters was excellent. She is definitely one of the underrated actresses out there.The film itself has some great plot twists and even though it had a very low budget - it manages to escape the feel of a B-movie. It even had some pretty good CGI animation. At the end everyone was clapping and as I walked out of the theater, feeling giddy - EVERYONE was smiling, laughing, reminiscing and all in all I didn't hear a single person saying anything negative about it. The only reason this film gets a 9 is because a 10 is reserved for maybe 5- 10 movies in my life. If you are a geek, were a geek, or simply have a little bit of geekyness in you - don't hesitate when it is released - it's worth every penny! Go with friends who appreciate this kind of stuff. I was never much of a role-playing fan and still felt completely connected to this film. Well done!!",positive
The 100 Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared,"I read this novel in the middle of 2014, and was delighted with the sly humour. When the movie came out - quite quickly I thought - I was a little wary of it, having seen so many good books really wrecked by the film making industry. However, I have to say that if you enjoyed the book (and you can cope with a little necessary pruning) you should enjoy the movie. It's very well done, it's very funny and it captures the essence of the book perfectly. The characters were well drawn and the flashbacks were condensed so that the story did not falter or fail but blended together sensibly. A good film for those with a perverse sense of humour. Must watch more Swedish films.",negative
The 100 Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared,"An unexpectedly great movie. I wasn't anticipating much from this Swedish independent, but was laughing all the way through. Fast paced and written with wry deadpan humor.The main character displays similar characteristics to Peter Sellers' Chauncey, in 'Being There'. Its also somewhat reminiscent of Arthur Penn's 70's classic 'Little Big Man' starring Dustin Hoffman in terms of the plot layout.Whether these were intentional homages to personal favorites of mine is not clear, but they worked magnificently. Serious belly laughs as dry humor is dropped effortlessly into every scene. It is such a refreshing change from all those polished Hollywood set pieces which have decreasingly appealing sequels. Enjoy.",positive
A Long Way Down,"Review: I quite enjoyed this witty drama which has something for everyone. On one side it's a deep drama because the 4 characters all have there own reasons to commit suicide but on the other side it's a enjoyable comedy because they all end up coming together and help each other through there individual problems. The fact they the 4 different characters end up on the roof on New Years Eve at exactly the same time was a bit weird, but each actor was very realistic and they really showed emotion. The chemistry between the characters was great and the director put the storyline together well but I do think that the movie could have been a bit better if there was a bit more depth to Pierce Brosnan's character. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Since Pierce Brosnan has hanged up his Bond suit, he has starred in a wide range of movies which. From singing in Mamma Mia, which was a total shock, to The Matador and Seraphim Falls, he has proved that he hasn't become type casted like many other actors in Hollywood. Aaron Paul comes fresh from Breaking Bad and has starred in Need For Speed which also stars Imogen Poots as his love interest. His acting style is very limited but it works in the roles that he has picked since Breaking Bad. Hopefully he will flourish in his next roles. Toni Collette is one of those actors that can take on any role that gets put in front of her. After her famous role in Muriel's Wedding, she has gone from strength to strength and I can't see this role damaging her career because she had the most emotional storyline to deal with. Basically, all of the actors put in a great performance and it was great to see Sam Neill back on the big screen.Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $7millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there emotional comedic dramas about 4 individuals who have there own reason to commit suicide. 6/10",negative
A Long Way Down,"This film was the most touching one I have seen in a very long time. The ratings just don't do it justice, the story line is amazing and the actors are even better, all the characters were brought to life. Everything that happened made you feel connected to the characters and they won't leave your hearts any time soon. It highlights some of the struggles that many people have to go through in society now and shows what happens when people are thrown into the spotlight. You feel a range of emotions, from being sad to happy, scared to joyous. I really enjoyed this and will be watching it many more times in the future. I would definitely recommend watching this, you'll love it.",positive
Ashby,"This might have been a mediocre movie. I knew someone who was a military sniper. His guilt over what he had done overcame him, and he committed suicide. There isis a meaningful story here that could have meant something.But how stupid can a producer, writer, or director be to put an MRI in the basement of a family home? It boggles the mind how stupid that is. A magnetic resonance imaging machine (MRI) will attract any metal to it while it is operating. That includes wrenches, bicycles, zippers on jeans, metal snaps on varsity jackets, etc.I have a friend who has metal fragments in his neck. He can't have an MRI because the machine would literally put the fragments out of his neck and possibly kill him. That's how powerful an MRI is. This whole MRI thing is just stupid, stupid, stupid.",negative
Ashby,"For those out there who seek out to destroy every piece of art. This is a movie about friendship, respect and love. This is a story about facing yourself in the mirror. A movie which will leave you thinking. Watch it, and enjoy it. The older Mikey gets the better his performances become. Although the depth of the characters is left shallow, the storyline is well done. If you are going to watch a movie anyway, then watch this one. Because this movie will teach you a thing or two; about life and everything that comes with it.We liked it personally because of the message is tries to convey while courage, love, friendship and family are at the front of this epic movie.",positive
Tallulah,"...Just like a lot of movies I've seen lately...that ending...wtf?! I can't stand movies with absolutely no closure for an ending (with the exception of a few psychological thriller, mystery/suspense, and horror movies). It's like everyone gets tired of making the movie so they just end it suddenly. All this time spent on character development...trying to make you like them or empathize with their situation, and yet you're not supposed to care about what happens to them or the outcome of the story? It's absurdity. Why the ratings are so high for this film is beyond me. Not the worst, but there are much better films out there. Watch I Heart Huckabees instead.",negative
Tallulah,"My wife and I both found this a small masterpiece.The writing is enchanting.The players are superb. Ellen Page never ceases to amaze. She is one very talented lady.Allison Jenney's work is always worth watching, never more so than in this flick.I found the Carolyn part played just a wee bit over the top.At a time when far too many movies are made for a young audience devoid of aesthetic sensibility, it's movies like this that rekindle love of film in the mature movie-goer.",positive
Danny Collins,"DANNY COLLINS (2015)Al Pacino as aging rockstar Danny Collins seemed weirdly miscast to me, but hey, it's Pacino and he pulled it off in movie star style. This story was loosely inspired by an event in folk singer Steve Tilson's life: Tilson recieved an encouraging letter from John Lennon, (with Lennon's phone number on it), decades after it was sent. He wonders how it might have changed his life if he got the letter at the time it was written. In this film, the rocker goes through a Hollywood movie sort of change and goes to New Jersey to make things right with a son he never met. In fact, in real life Tilson has several children that he has solid relationships with. The cast, including Annette Bening, Jennifer Garner, Bobby Cannavale, and Christopher Plummer, all turn out solid performances, (Bening is fantastic, actually), but the enjoyable movie never catches fire with me. I thought it was good, but not great; easy to watch, but it felt contrived and not deeply memorable to me.",negative
Danny Collins,"Greetings again from the darkness. He who was once Michael Corleone is now Danny Collins. With a career spanning 40 plus years with 8 Oscar nominations, including a win for Scent of a Woman, Al Pacino must be considered Hollywood royalty. Upon closer analysis, that last nomination and win came more than 20 years ago, and he is now the go-to guy for a demonstrative, (more than a) few years past his prime type. So on paper, we get why Pacino was cast as Danny Collins (think modern day Neil Diamond).The film begins with a very young Collins being interviewed by a rock journalist (Nick Offerman) after the release of his first album. Flash forward 40 years, and Collins has made a career of re-hashing the same songs to the same concert goers. He lives in a mansion, throws lavish parties, has a fiancé who could be his granddaughter, and absorbs coke and booze between flights on his private jet. It's only now that Frank (Christopher Plummer), his agent and best friend, presents him with a long lost letter written to Collins by John Lennon after that interview so many years before. Cue the bells and whistles  it's time for a redemption road trip.It's only at this point that we understand the cute ""kind of based on a true story"" tag at the opening credits. See, Lennon did write a letter in 1971 to British Folk Singer Steve Tilston, and the letter did take many years to find its way to him. However, Tilston never lost his creative vision the way that Danny Collins did (otherwise, there would be no movie).What happens next is predictable and a bit formulaic. Colllins tracks down his adult son (Bobby Cannavale) from an early career backstage fling, and does all he is capable of doing to cannonball into his life, and that of his wife (Jennifer Garner) and young daughter (Giselle Eisenberg). Expect the usual TV melodramatics as far as disease and suburban family challenges, and tie-in a flirty back-and-forth with the Hilton manager (Annette Benning), and you can pretty much fill in the blanks for the balance of the film.Cannavale and Plummer certainly do everything they can to elevate the storyline. Cannavale's emotions are all over the place as one would expect and he is the most believable of all characters. Plummer adds a sense of reality and humor to his interludes with Pacino – wisely controlling his movements against Pacino's histrionics.Stories involving a characters seeking redemption have one thing in common  a character who is not so likable. We never really buy him as the aging rock star, or even as the once promising songwriter, but we do buy him as the guy who was too busy for his family and is clumsy and unaware of the pain he causes, even while trying to do the right thing.Writer/director Dan Fogelman takes few risks in his first shot at directing. His past writing includes the excellent Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011) and the not so excellent Last Vegas (2013). His common theme seems to be the emotional struggle of men, and we definitely know that's an unsolved mystery. His effort here may not be a bull's-eye, but it's not without some merit – despite the Pacino distraction.",positive
Life After Beth,"LIFE AFTER BETH (2014) * Aubrey Plaza, Dane DeHaan, John C.

The crimes against comedy (let alone humanity) is first-time (and hopefully LAST time) filmmaker Jeff Baena who wouldn't recognize a fart from an ad-lib in his tone-deaf attempt at satire, dark comedy or sharp skewer to cul-de-sac audiences he's so desperately catering to while completely wasting his vast amount of talent acquired (squandering so much comedic casting is unbearably sad).

Life After Beth,"This is a horror comedy. Except, it's not. People who expect the usual mix of jump scares and laughs from this movie end up most disappointed. It's a love story with zombies. But not a happy one like Warm Bodies. Much more sad and dramatic. And humor is much more dry and subtle. Unfortunately, people who sit down to watch a zombie comedy do not really expect subtle. And people who want subtle do not look into zombie comedies. This is why this little gem is one of the most underrated movies on IMDB.

The Young and Prodigious T.S.

Life of Crime,"Review: I found it really hard to get into this film because the storyline was weak and extremely unrealistic. The movie is based around a couple of guys who kidnap a rich man's wife in order to get a million dollars for her release. Not the most unique idea for a film! Anyway, I was expecting it to be witty, judging by the cast, but it was more silly than amusing. Mos Def and John Hawkes come up with the dumbest of plans, which was just not that well thought through. When there plan starts to go downhill, there terrible criminal minds come up with another sketchy plan to get themselves out of the mess they made. The storyline goes from one extreme to another and it doesn't help that they have a Nazi loving criminal to help them, who also has personal issues. Basically, the movie wasn't funny or interesting but I did stick with the film, just to see what these dumb criminals were going to do next. Average! Round-Up: Judging by the unsuccessful box office takings, I'm not alone with thinking that this film was a total waste of a good cast. Its not often that Jennifer Aniston makes ""Straight To DVD"" movies, but after watching this film, it's not surprising that it flopped. All of the actors try and make the most out of a terrible storyline, but there performances isn't enough to save the film. On the plus side, I did like the ending when characters decide to flip the script and kidnap someone else but it doesn't really go anywhere. I didn't get how someone could go missing for a week without anyone suspecting anything and there was some other sketchy moments that I don't want to mention because I don't want to spoil the film for people who haven't watched it. At the end of the day, it could have been much better if the storyline was thought through properly and if the actual plan made any sense.Budget: $12million Worldwide Gross: $1.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedy/crime movies about a couple of down and outs, who plan to kidnap a rich man's wife for a million dollar ransom. 3/10",negative
Life of Crime,"The amount of bad reviews for this movie shocks me. Saying it's unrealistic or boring. Yes, of course ts unrealistic, just like 90% of other movies; but it's not supposed to be taken seriously. It it neither a serious thriller or a hilarious romantic comedy so don't review it like it's one or the other. It is a lighthearted funny crime movie with twists that often aren't predictable. The acting by all parties is terrific. If you go in not expecting anything but an enjoyable 100 minutes of screen time, then you will love it.",positive
Jenny's Wedding,"Jenny's Wedding, for the most part, has been discarded and labelled below average amongst most film critics and the public, therefore I began watching this film with preconceived ideas. Films consisting of gay female relationships are sparse, and ones that are watchable are even rarer, however this happened to fall into both categories. The problem arises when viewers deem the focus of this film to be something different to what it is, many people comment on the lack of chemistry between Heigl and Bledel, whereas upon watching the film it is clear the lack of screen time they actually had together played a part in that, and the film is less about their relationship as such, and much more focused on Heigl's family and their relationships with each other and Jenny respectively. Needless to say it was a sweet, feel-good film that; of course, has a plot which has been done many times before, but still kept me watching until the end.",negative
Jenny's Wedding,"Jenny's Wedding is an under-appreciated film that I think will surprise many of you. It is one of many fine quality films that I find myself asking: Why didn't this get more than just an extremely shallow limited release? It certainly deserved better than only grossing a paltry $6244 worldwide, especially considering the end product.Piloted by veteran screenwriter-director Mary Agnes Donaghue (Beaches, White Oleander), the movie starts with a well written script. It is bolstered by fine performances across the board from a talented cast that includes Katherine Heigl, Tom Wilkinson, Linda Edmund, Grace Gummer and Alexis Beidel. It's crew achieved high production values that would compare favorably with films 5 times their budget. It has all the ingredients to be a fine film and delivers on that promise.Jenny's Wedding problem lies in Hollywood's inability to label it and know how to sell it rather than the film itself. It never meets the expectations unfairly placed on it by others to be a film it never pretended to be. It never was intended to be a laugh a minute comedy or a sappy love story or even a bold message film. It is an honest portrayal of how family members when placed in unfamiliar waters, may surprise or disappoint, themselves and others in how they act.I think this film benefits greatly from being seen with out any expectations. I had the benefit of watching this film without seeing the trailer or reading the blurb, both which reveal too much about the story. I enjoyed how the story unfolded, the slightly surprising but not shocking plot twist, and the unpredictability of how family members act and react when conflict arises. It had a credible balance of painful and feel good moments that any normal family goes through. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Jenny's Wedding and hope you will too.",positive

Miss You Already,"This is the archetypal woman's film - but there's nothing wrong with that, with far too few opportunities for women in the key roles in movie-making. So women fill the slots of scriptwriter (the British Morwenna Banks), director (American Catherine Hardwicke) and the two top acting positions (Australian Toni Collette and American Drew Barrymore). And the subject material is feminine too: breast cancer, infertility, and female friendship. Like ""The Fault In Our Stars"", this is a frank exposition of what it is like to suffer cancer - in this case, with chemotherapy and its attendant sickness, tiredness and hair loss followed by headaches, vision loss, and pain. It sounds tough and it is - one the saddest film I've seen in a long while - but there is humour and warmth and superior acting which make it worth viewing this real slice of life. After all, most of us of a certain age have had relatives or friends who have suffered one form of cancer or another, some surviving, some not.",positive

Turbo Kid,"Let's make a movie about the future, but set it in the past and make it look like it was set even further in the past. That could've been the pitch for ""Turbo Kid"" (NR, 1:33) – and that's just one of many interesting and unusual things that there are to learn about this film even before discussing what it's about. For one thing, it's a co-production of Canada and New Zealand. Since it's technically a foreign film, it has no MPAA rating (but if it did, it would surely be rated ""R""). The movie has three directors, François Simard, Anouk Whissell and Yoann-Karl Whissell, all three of which also share credit for the screenplay, and all appear in the movie in small roles. What's more, the cinematographer, Jean-Philippe Bernier, is also one of the two people who did the film's score, which is a highly unusual combination of jobs. Now, let's get back to that highly unusual pitch summary in the first sentence of this paragraph.""Turbo Kid"" is a post-apocalyptic action movie set in the ""future"" year of 1997. That actually makes sense when you know that the film intentionally looks and sounds like it was made in the early 1980s. Stating it another way, this movie is ""retro futuristic"". It's a lot like many of the movies made in the late 70s and early 80s. In fact, the year picked for the story's setting, 1997, is the same year in which 1981's classic dystopian action thriller ""Escape from New York"" takes place. And that's not the only connection between other movies of this film's sub-genre. There are passing verbal references and visuals that are subtle shout-outs to movies like ""Soylent Green"" and ""The Terminator"". What's not so subtle is the strong and obvious influence of another post-apocalyptic film series from the 1980s (rebooted in 2015) on the plot, setting and costumes in this movie. As ""Wired"" magazine said, it's ""'Mad Max' on a BMX"".Munro Chambers plays a character simply called ""The Kid"", an orphaned teen just trying to survive in a land laid waste by something (?) which led to the end of civilized society. The Kid scavenges items that he can ""sell"" to his world's version of a pawn broker (Romano Ozari) for that most precious of commodities – water. The water that exists is under the control of a sadistic general called Zeus (Michael Ironside). As he brags to his ""minions"" (NOT the cute kind), he not only provides their liquid sustenance, but their entertainment as well. He sponsors regular violent and bloody gladiatorial-like contests between his ""henchmen"" (better word) and those unfortunate enough to have double-crossed Zeus or just crossed his path.When he's not scavenging, The Kid is obsessing over his favorite superhero, someone called ""Turbo Rider"". The Kid has various Turbo Rider memorabilia in his house and then gets a hold of an old Turbo Rider comic book, which he seems to value almost as much as staying hydrated. As he's sitting in an old playground reading his comic book aloud to himself, he's approached by a girl named Apple (played by Canadian actress Laurence Leboeuf) who wants to be friends. She's impossibly chipper (either gratingly or adorably, depending on your point of view) and she may or may not be a cold-blooded killer. But she insists on hanging out with The Kid, and, well, friends are hard to come by in this terrible future-past (or is it past-future?), so he lets her tag along as he scavenges.As dangerous as this time and place is, you have to be tough to survive. The Kid teaches Apple his rules for survival and soon the two of them meet someone even tougher than The Kid – a cowboy type named Frederic (Aaron Jeffery) who's an arm-wrestling champion and the closest thing that the few decent people left alive have to a protector. That is, until The Kid becomes Turbo Kid. He finds a costume that makes him look and feel like his hero, Turbo Man. The costume doesn't help him fly or anything, but it does have a pretty serious weapon built into one of the arms. The Kid becomes Turbo Kid just in the nick of time. For different reasons, Apple and Frederic both run afoul of Zeus and they need some serious turbo-charged rescuing! But even if Turbo Kid can free his only two friends from the clutches of Zeus, he'd likely be pretty ticked off and would probably want to hunt them down and, you know, kill them all.It's kind of a tough thing to judge this movie. On the one hand, it is very effective at evoking the feeling of cheesy early-80s future schlock. On the other hand, the violence (albeit comic violence) can be a bit excessive – unless you find dismemberment and gallons of fake blood shooting everywhere to be amusing. Still, the graphic destruction of so many human bodies notwithstanding, this movie deserves credit for being very different from any other 2015 release and it is more entertaining than not. All this comes out to a mild recommendation – with a strong warning. Considering all the blood and guts, a kids' movie this is not, but adults (especially those who like the cheesier movies of the 70s and 80s, and enjoy a good splatter flick) may find seeing ""Turbo Kid"" to be a blast. This B-movie gets a ""B"".",negative
Turbo Kid,"If your primary movie-going experience is watching Hollywood blockbusters with vin diesel, this may not be your cup of tea, but for everyone else, this film destroys it.This film is pure gold, 80's indulgent, brain melting gore, a love story, and even somewhat artistic at times.I won't drone on, but this film i destined to be a staple in horror/art house/comedy cinema.It is fast-paced, adorable, hilarious, brutal, and has a charm that only filmmakers in love with their genres can produce. This is not Hollywood, but you wouldn't know it. Often times I can either purchase a film to see it, or watch it streaming but, it's a rare occasion when i see a film and have to instantly purchase it.",positive
Ricki and the Flash,"Revering the director and cast, as well as admiring the screenwriter of ""Juno,"" I was shocked and pained by ""Ricki and the Flash."" A few gems have successfully combining music and drama without being a musical, especially ""Once."" Not this one.""Ricki"" should be showcased in a film school course called ""Movies Gone Wrong."" (If you are interested in this phenomenon, read the classic article by Pauline Kael about her witnessing the process of the making of ""The Group."") The dissection of this disappointing work starts with the script. The director should have either sent it back for rewrites or demanded a script doctor. Someone needed to rescue its relentlessly shapeless scenes, meandering plot lines, unnecessary throw-in details, half-conceived characters and contrived conflicts. This combination inevitably leads to a conclusion full of cheap sentimentality.In more detail, one must next focus on the characters and their arcs. We'll stick with the center of the movie, Ricki, an aging rocker who plays with passion in a bar band. She had long ago abandoned her role as a mother and wife to pursue her singular musical goals. The movie and actress depicts her as a self-centered, thin-skinned, unapologetic, non-introspective mess. Who cares about someone who fails to demonstrates any kind of consistent attachment with her children? The filmmakers' choice is a dead end leading to a no-coming-back dramatic cliff.They could have turned the character into a pioneer, one whose singular artistic drive might be off-putting, but whose uncompromising spirit inspires her children. In her arc, she re-balances her life, finds some humility, accepts responsibility for her neglect through action, but refuses to give up on her passion. She becomes a good enough mother, which is good enough for children. Her sons and daughter might settle for a parent who is flawed, but lovable and forgivable. Instead, the script makes aging rocker Ricki insinuate herself into her ex's life and their shared children, a family that has been basically good enough with the usual dramas. Even if you introduce a severely depressed daughter, played by Mamie Gummer, there's no parallel between the mother's self-centered abandonment and her daughter's recoiling from a short-lived, failed marriage. Then (SPOILER ALERT, but one that's not that big0, it makes the recently bankrupt Ricki talk this depressed daughter into skipping her therapy session and getting indulged at a spa. It becomes a plot turning point, but it's based on a phony conflict. Why not see the therapist together, let the sparks fly, then heal their wounds with a spa treatment. Instead the next scene shows the mother and step-mother arguing over spa treatment versus therapy and uses it as a pretense to create a war between two strong-willed women. It results in drama reduced to a lifeless spat.In the end, I found myself squirming over this self-indulgent movie, where the cast seems to be having much more fun than the audience, a cast hamstrung into depicting honest feeling in a phony, sentimentally contrived drama. We're left at the end watching essentially music videos by talented musicians that have no emotional resonance. It can make you turn your head away, embarrassed for this extremely talented A-list cast and crew.",negative
Ricki and the Flash,"It's hard to think of anything that Meryl Streep hasn't done in a career that goes all the way back to the 1970s. But with RICKI AND THE FLASH, we find out something brand new. She rocks! Literally! Re-teaming up with SILENCE OF THE LAMBS director Jonathan Demme (the two had worked together on Demme's 2004 updating of the 1962 Cold War classic THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, where she played Angela Lansbury's part), Streep stars as Ricki Randazzo, a wanted-to-be rock and roll star who had one brief moment of success in the 80s, but is now consigned to play out her strings (all six of them) out at the dingy Salt Well club in Tarzana with her band The Flash and her boyfriend (played by Rick Springfield, he of ""Jessie's Girl"" fame). But soon, she has a calling from Indianapolis; the family she left behind to follow her rock and roll dreams is rapidly falling apart, most noticeably in the suicidal tendencies of her daughter Julie (Mamie Gummer, who is Streep's real-life daughter), and her ex-husband (Kevin Kline, teaming with Streep for only the second time, the first being 1982's SOPHIE'S CHOICE) trying to hold things together with a new wife (Audra MacDonald). With real life intruding in, the collision of her love for performing and wanting to set things right with her family, Streep's character sometimes looks like she's closer to having a nervous breakdown than even her own daughter. But with Springfield's help, she comes to her daughter's wedding (with the band in tow, unbeknownst to the uptight, upper-crust crowd there who know very little of her past), and manages to redeem herself in a lot of great ways.Streep, who had done music-themed movies before (having done her own singing in 1990's POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE, and portrayed a music teacher in 1999's MUSIC OF THE HEART), just doesn't seem capable of doing any wrong in films, and so it is sometimes quite easy to take her and her generation for granted (though contemporary Hollywood often seems to take that generation for granted way too many times). Playing Ricki, however, was quite a stretch for her all the same; and she manages to pull it off quite well, doing quite the job of playing acoustic and electric guitars and singing for this role in a way that, dare one say it, could have her in line for yet another Oscar nomination, if not another outright win. This shouldn't take away from the other great supporting performances, including Springfield, Kline (whose wryness and off-the-cuff humor are exceptionally refreshing), and MacDonald, let alone Gummer, who has some extremely interesting scenes with her mother (though reportedly they spent very little time together off the set during the making of the film per Demme's instructions). Demme's direction is also quite good (he refrains from doing the straight face-on shots of previous films); and the film features longtime Eagles/Joe Walsh backing musician Joe Vitale as the Flash's drummer, and a soundtrack that includes a lot of rock classics that Streep sings on her own (quite well, I would add).This is not a typical summer-movie flick with high-octane action (unless one considers Streep's stage presence an example of an ""action"" scene); and yet RICKI AND THE FLASH will likely end up being considered one of the best films of 2015. It's already one of mine, for sure.",positive
Top Five,"Those that have reviewed this movie must be involved in receiving monies from it. I'm a regular movie goer and this had to be one of the worst I've seen in a long time. Very embarrassing for Chris Rock.Rosario Dawson did her best to make this movie watchable and even believable but this was sad. Chris Rock has never been a good actor...so imagine combining bad acting with a terrible movie. Do such and you get Top Five.There are many big names that make an appearance or two in this movie, yet it doesn't help. Cedric the Entertainer plays more of a role than most and has some funny parts. He is like a promoter, pimp, etc that will provide a few laughs but the movie is just awful.This also taught me to not trust the reviews on here. Wow!!!",negative
Top Five,"'TOP FIVE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Chris Rock wrote, directed and stars in this comedy flick about a former stand-up comedian, and popular movie star, who tries to make it in serious film; while also marrying a reality TV star, on TV. It costars Rosario Dawson, Gabrielle Union, Kevin Hart, J.B. Smoove and many others. It also features cameos from celebrities like Tracy Morgan, Cedric the Entertainer, DMX, Whoopi Goldberg, Adam Sandler and Jerry Seinfeld. The film has gotten almost unanimously positive reviews from critics and has been nominated for multiple awards as well (and it's also won a couple). I think it's a well made and funny movie and it deserves all the praise and recognition it's been getting (too bad that doesn't result in big Box Office).Rock plays a celebrity, somewhat similar to himself, named Andre Allen. Allen was an extremely successful stand-up comedian, who also starred in a blockbuster film franchise called 'Hammy The Bear'. He also had some alcohol problems and legal issues though, in his past, and is now a recovering alcoholic. Allen is now engaged to a popular reality TV star, named Erica Long (Union), that he's supposed to marry on TV. His first serious film, called 'Uprise' (a movie about the violent Haitian revolution), is also being released that weekend. Fans just want to see him do more comedy and 'Hammy The Bear' films though. Allen's also agreed to do a detailed interview, with a reporter named Chelsea Brown (Dawson), that same weekend too.The movie is funny but what I'm most impressed with, about the film, is Rock's skills as a director and film writer. I already knew he was funny, and could write and deliver a lot of good jokes, but I didn't know he was this talented of a filmmaker. Although some of the humor is pretty silly, it still feels like you're watching real people in real situations. Rock's commentary on the film business, stand-up comedy and reality TV seems pretty spot-on too. He's good in the lead and the supporting cast is almost equally as impressive; Dawson is always beautiful and likable to watch and Union is stunning and gorgeous too. The cameos are also to die for.

Are You Here,OK with the two leads... you'd expect it to be silly and funny. With some quirky moments.Instead... it was just silly. Not funny. Not clever. Not Quirky. Failed to create any desire in the viewer to care what happened to the two lead men who seemed bored and well aware they were participating in a cinematic piece of trash with the characters created just for the male leads to pull out their well worn one theme characters. Problem is... the script and the whole concept was simply not funny. Not dramatic. This was a film that simply ticked no boxes.Sound design was always non existent except when it was clichéd.Saved from a 1 by a beautiful performance from Laura Ramsey who got no top billing for some reason?Even with her performance?Total rubbish.

Are You Here,"Thing is, this is not comedy, definitely not a classic romance story. The message it delivers is a hint of a more deep line. The false reality of things we are teach to want... Sure the story has a couple problems whit internal integrity and coherence, but the characters feel real !! real people... not some cartoon sister craving for the gold or a ""hippie"" against the system. Its truly remarkable the work the actors did to (at least in my case)make me forget it was a Hollywood movie. And i believe that the same thing i found so amazing is why is underrated. Its really not commercial. Most of todays indie films are gross commercials productions (all comedies sure are), the only thing that changes is the public, a more refined public or a less one.

Tales of Halloween,"I like a good, strange movie occasionally, but this one made little sense most of the time.I won't comment on the acting or effects, there are enough reviews that I have seen regarding those. And as a fan of the classic Universal monster, old Vincent Prince, Three Stooges and Abbott and Costello monster movies, I knkw that seldom does acting or effects determine my enjoyment of a spooky-season movie. Cohesive storytelling on the other hand, that is important. I can forgive a multitude of sins if the story makes sense.Tales of Halloween is described as ""the best horror anthology since Trick'r Treat"". But where Trick'r Treat's connectivity was integrated into each story, (characters appearing in the background, Sam being present, past events influencing more than one story), this rancid pile of pumpkin gut's connections are tenuous at best. The only real connection is the radio DJ narrative and a couple times you do catch a glimpse of characters from other stories. Few of the stories make any sort of sense if any at all, and those that do have the potential to make decent spooky story, Trick and Grim Grinning Ghost for example, are so short they might as well have been left out altogether.When you go back and read the blurb, these are supposed to be some of the top directors in horror. One would think, that an anthology created by top directors in a genre, would be more cohesive and fleshed out, but it feels more like they each just phoned it in.If anything, this mess mocks Halloween in general, and not in a fun satirical way. It's more like a school yard bully vs the nerdy, Halloween-loving kid.I would have preferred a return of Sam with new tales or even a return of The Crypt-keeper from the 90s.For my Halloween entertainment I'll stick to Trick'r Treat and Tales from the Crypt.",negative

I'm shocked at all the hate for Rob Lowe and Salma Hayek! They played their parts perfectly! And Eugenio Derbez was on point! The Spanish translated dialogue added even more comedy to the performances.I'm not sure what all the negative remarkers were expecting, nor what they are comparing it to make it so bad, but this one is a real winner and I suggest you see it and hopefully give this the higher rating it really deserves to out-weigh the miserable low scores.10/10 because I can't think of what could have made this movie any better than what it was!",positive

If they had cast actors with more imagination, they would have been able to bring a little more life to this dull material and made the film at least a 5-star average. As it is, this is mediocre at best and certainly not worth watching, unless you're a Cusack completist.",negative
Adult World,"Amy dreams to become a successful poem writer. For this to be accomplished she needs money and someone to guide her. So she looks for a job and finds one at an adult shop. Forced by circumstances she accepts. Her parent doesn't know about this and after a fuss in witch Amy wants to have more liberty and the desire to be free and not be treated as a little girl, runs away from home and goes to live with Rubia, a transsexual that she mets at her new workplace. Destiny makes that she will be in a more warm relationship with her favorite poet that she sees him as a mentor. Rat offers his advice to her but soon finds out that his number one fan may not be 100% sane and decides to dedicate a special book just to her.In this movie Emma Roberts is very irritating and annoying, we have to assist at her nerve attacks. Of course take part of her role and she is convincing, in fact she is a talented actress but maybe this part is not very suitable with her capacities. The film is watchable still the action takes place in small steps. It's the kind of picture that you can watch 15 minutes and FF another 15 and you will not miss anything. In fact if you view 30 minutes then continue the next day with another 30 and you finish the film in the third day, it may be more bearable.",positive
Our Brand Is Crisis,"Greetings again from the darkness. The world of political campaigns and elections is a never-ending treasure trove of material for movies. It's a subject ripe for parody, satire, comedy, suspense and documentaries. Need proof? How about this widely varied list: The Manchurian Candidate, Bob Roberts, Wag the Dog, Bulworth, Welcome to Mooseport, and The Ides of March. Director David Gordon Green has a resume equally as varied, ranging from Pineapple Express (2008) to Manglehorn (2014).This wide spectrum of possibilities seems to have confused screenwriter Peter Straughan (the excellent Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) who used Rachel Boynton's 2005 documentary of the same name as inspiration. It seems to be both a comedy that's not too funny and a drama that not very dramatic. Casting Sandra Bullock in the lead probably created a certain feeling of security with the filmmakers, as they assumed audiences would laugh along at such creative moments as her predictable pratfall from a private jet, the sunglasses-on-the-nose look of consternation, and the rah-rah speech given to a group of campaign volunteers who don't speak English. Even fans of Ms. Bullock will recognize the laziness.Alvin Lee and Ten Years After delivered the anthem ""I'd Love to Change the World"", and never before this movie had I placed it in such a negative manner  how the United States sticks its nose where it doesn't belong in international elections. Ms. Bullock's character Jane is a political strategist brought out of self-imposed exile to run the campaign of Bolivia's former President (played by Joaquim de Almeida). See he is far behind the leader in the polls – a progressive candidate whose campaign is being run by Bullock's long-time rival Pat Candy (played by Billy Bob Thornton). Let the juicy rivalry games begin! The only problem is  it's a wasted rivalry filled with mostly lame games and it's often quite plodding (just like real politics!). The character of Jane is based on the real life efforts of James Carville to influence South American elections, and yet it's Pat Candy who sports the look of Carville. The supporting cast is filled with talent: Anthony Mackie, Ann Dowd, Scoot McNairy, and Zoe Kazan, yet none are given much to do other than play second fiddle to Bullock.While the script offers no real surprises or twists, and the forced ""message"" at the end could be guessed by most any viewer 10 minutes in, it's the amateurish ploys that make this one score high on the annoyance scale. Having Ms. Bullock sport the only blonde follicles in Bolivia, the over-use of super slow-motion to create some unnecessary effect, and using the word ""crisis"" the way Tarantino uses the f-word, all combine to give the film a very cheesy look and feel  and we aren't even rewarded with a single memorable exchange between Bullock and Billy Bob. One thing for sure  this is not the garden spot of Bolivia.",negative
Our Brand Is Crisis,"There are numerous movies and TV series that are dealing with elections. Most of them are focusing (obviously) in the electoral race and their climax is the outcome of the election. Some of them though have a stronger, more political message. A ""morale"" if you prefer...""Our Brand Is Crisis"" starts as a comedy but in its epilogue says some hard truths about the world we are living.Sandra Bullock stars as the depressed campaign manager who essentially wants to beat her opposite colleague (a really thin Billy Bob Thornton) with whom share a past both professionally and personally. She looks really good, especially in the beginning of the film, before she experiences ""soroche"" (Altitude sickness) in the heights of Bolivia.The script is intelligent and has a few funny moments, but it is obvious that the winning an electoral race isn't the main theme here. It is what happens after that. How easily could manipulate people, who hasn't realized that his vote it is not only his strongest power, it is his only power.Politicians have fake promises and lies into their blood stream. They could tell and promise anything so they get elected and then forget about it. You know it, I know it, everyone knows it, but still act and vote without really thinking. ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" tries to remind that to its audience.Overall: A movie which easy to watch. Not a ""big"" movie. Has its moments. Sandy looks good and there is a morale so to make you think twice before you vote in the next elections...",positive
The Last: Naruto the Movie,"horrible movie. road to ninja was popular because it gave time to all characters, and we got a sense of team 7 again (somewhat). the manga was originally about team 7, this movie just took that away. i like naruto and hinata together, really but they should have given the other couples some screen time too instead of leaving them hanging. i mean, even ten minutes each ? sasuke and sakura at least deserved some screen time, they're the main characters aside naruto, and the fans die to see team 7 moments again in combat since we haven't had those animated since narutos first season. ALSO they really should have given us some team 7 moments since this was the last movie we would get to see those. everyone loved the last moments of team 7 in the manga, that's what people like. TEAM 7. not naruto and hinata love throughout. they could have taken it side by side... naruto, hinata, sasuke and sakura in combat. that would have been epic, and would have addressed all the fans out there.

The Last: Naruto the Movie,"Beautiful is the only word that can come to mind when thinking of this film. It was a master piece, and it was written by Kishimoto himself. This film also stood out among the many other non-canon films that have been produced, adding a bit more than your usual jam packed action. Believe it or not, but this is a story of Love, presenting the birth of the bond between Naruto Uzumaki and Hinata Hyuga. It shows how they have grown, changed and matured, stirring at the heart strings of the many Naruto fans that have watched it from start to finish. Words alone could not describe this films beauty, so I will say no more. What I will say is, I STRONGLY recommend that all of you fans of Naruto and Naruto Shippuden watch this. It is a film you should not miss.",positive

Moms' Night Out,"The critics got it right. The movie is awful.Having a popular star like Patricia Heaton in this movie is not enough to save it. The mothers and fathers depicted in this movie are mostly idiots and should never have had children. The script wouldn't have been approved for an ABC afternoon special because it's so poor.My wife and I went to see the movie because the 17 user reviews available at the time on IMDb gave the movie an 8 or above with accolades like: ""Love this movie,"" ""Perfect Mother's Day Fun,"" ""Funniest movie I have seen in a long time,"" and ""Greatest Movie Ever Made."" Don't believe any of these reviews. Having seen the movie, it's clear to me that the reviewers had an ulterior motive.My history teacher in college, when announcing the next test date, would always preface his remarks with ""I know a word to the wise is foolish."" This was generally aimed at those who would put off studying for the test until the last minute. Well, being foolish, I would like to offer a word to the wise which I failed to follow when considering this movie. For movies you are unsure you would like, don't trust a very positive or very negative review on IMDb unless you at least scan all of that user's reviews. This will give you an idea where the user is coming from; if his/her tastes agree with yours; and whether there are any ulterior motives in posting the review. If a film has been absolutely panned on Metacritic, like this one was, be careful about selecting to go to that movie in the theaters. IMDb is generally a good source of what the users say. The operative word is ""generally."" In this instance it was not.My review was a warning that this movie is not worth seeing. The fact that only 2 of 13 users so far found this warning helpful offers another clue about how IMDb reviewers can have an agenda. Who were the 11 people who found that my warning was not helpful? Are they the same people who find stop signs annoying or could they possibly be the same people who wrote the overwhelming positive reviews of this movie.",negative
Moms' Night Out,"Moms' Night Out is such a breath of fresh air! It's clean! I could take whoever I wanted to, and leave without blushing. The film will most likely appeal to moms (particular those with younger kids), as it is easy to relate and see yourself in the characters. I literally laughed out loud (even to the point of tears more than once) for the majority of the movie. Love, love, love it! A must see, and an especially great mother's day movie to enjoy with a mom.This is actually the second time I've seen the movie, and I thought it was just as funny the second time around! I've already planned two more group outings with my mom friends. I'm telling you, as a mom of preschoolers I loved it!I've read several reviews that were not favorable towards the movie, and I have to say the person writing the review must not be a mom (and possibly not a parent at all). The movie was written for someone like me. I get it. I know that I find some of the gags funny because I've either experienced them or something similar. Much of the movie is a true to life look at a moms life (not a complete look by any means, but I think every mom has had one of those days). I think if you fit their target audience, you'll love the film as much as I did.",positive

Look Who's Back,"Look Who's Back is an amazing German movie that takes a rather old-fashioned science-fiction premise and gives it a new twist. A man from the past finds himself inexplicably transported to the present-day. The man turns out to be none other than Adolph Hitler, who, like anyone in such a situation, is dazed and confused and at first wondering what has happened. Even worse for him, he is transported in one of his old uniforms and at first finds himself wandering the streets of 2014 Berlin, with curious onlookers assuming that he is a kook worthy perhaps of a selfie shot from a cell phone. Hitler soon gets his bearings, however, and a fresh set of clothes, and befriends a television producer, who turns him into something of an internet sensation. The rest of the movie is a fascinating surmise of what Hitler might be in the present day.Look Who's Back is something of a cross-cultural comedy, like Malcolm McDowell's Time After Time, which also involved a celebrity time-traveler (HG Wells). We get to see him learn about modern things like TV, cooking shows, computers, and the internet, and we of course get to see what he might think of modern politics. He is often awkward in the modern world, so we get to laugh. But look out, this is Hitler, and he is the same super-self-possessed demon that we all know and dread. The character is 3D and drawn with amazing brilliance by Oliver Masucci. He starts doing what Hitler would do--talking to people, getting a sense of their anxieties and grievances, projecting a sense of earnestness and mission, and let's face it--charming the heck out of everyone around him as he goes on to become something of a media personality. Which is really what makes this movie so interesting. In the 1930s, Germany did not know what it was dealing with in Hitler, was fooled by his charms and facade. In 2014, no one believed that the new Hitler was real, but again everyone was duped by the facade--they all thought he was a comedian, until it turned out that he had an agenda. I found the the actions and demeanor of the character as drawn by the movie both convincing and fascinating. Watching people get suckered again in 2014 was a rather humbling experience. Look Who's Back is well worth your time--it is both entertaining and disturbing, a great character study and a convincing story. Hitler's rather comfy integration into 2014 will really give you pause to think.",negative
Look Who's Back,"Making fun of Hitler has had a long tradition, dating back to when Hitler was alive, and one of the greatest comedies of all time, Charlie Chaplin's _The Great Dictator_. Indeed, Chaplin can be briefly glimpsed in _Look Who's Back_, along with other actors who portrayed or lampooned Hitler over the decades.Just like _The Great Dictator_ manages to be a thoroughly serious movie towards the very end and Chaplin's famous speech extolling democracy, _Look Who's Back_ also has a serious undertone beneath all the slapstick. It, therefore, meets the prime criterion for supreme comedy: that it should be very funny to watch (and you're likely to laugh out loud quite a few times) but simultaneously deadly serious in its message._Look Who's Back_, ingeniously, features not just a twist ending, but *two* twist endings, followed, quite a bit later, by the genuine ending. It is precisely during the two twist endings that the movie is the most serious. It probes the viewer's faith in democracy – is it a viable model for society at all? And, are human beings, at their core, good or bad? The answer is, of course, ""neither"", or ""both"". And that is exactly what the twist endings demonstrate: first, Hitler speaks so convincingly as to make even his most virulent opponents among the viewers admit that he has a point. It appears that evil has triumphed after all; or, is it human negligence and mental laziness and self-centeredness that allows voters to shrug their shoulders and, perhaps despite some inner misgivings, elect someone like Hitler to be their leader? In any case, Hitler affirms that he'd be back – not forcefully, but joyously welcomed by the people as their beloved leader.But wait! Florian the common man wants to have none of it. His repulsion against evil is too great, and after struggling mightily with himself, he shoots Hitler. It appears that the good has triumphed after all.But wait! There's another twist coming, and then yet another – the movie's true ending that, so to say, ""hangs in the balance"" and is neutral. It says that the time for Hitler's return in today's Europe, confused by the refugee crisis, is auspicious. It now depends on us, the viewers, whether we allow that to happen.The very last few moments in _Look Who's Back_ show some real-life newsreel footage of unrests during the refugee crisis (the movie was made in 2014 as opposed to the book that was released 3 years earlier when the refugee crisis wasn't a topic of discussion). I thought that the addition of this real-life footage was unnecessary, too ""propaganda-laden"", if you will (although well-meant), and I wish this would have been left out. One can too palpably feel that this was just ""slapped on"" to the finished movie as an afterthought, as a reaction to the refugee crisis in post-2014 Europe. The slapstick is great throughout, and some scenes are unforgettably hilarious, such as Hitler's secretary setting up an email account for him, but discovering that all of Hitler's preferred user names (including his own name) are already taken. Not only in moments like these, Oliver Masucci gives an excellent performance in the title role – understated in the proper moments, funny but nuanced.Generally, the actors' performances in _Look Who's Back_ are superb, and credit for guiding them so expertly must be given to the director David Wnendt. I was particularly impressed by Christoph Maria Herbst and Katja Riemann in the roles of dueling, high-powered media executives. The chilliness and ruthlessness exuded by their characters is almost palpable. Herbst is supposed to be a comedic actor primarily, but his character in _Look Who's Back_ is above all a dramatic figure, and Herbst's portrayal is spot-on. (In one of Herbst's funnier moments, _Look Who's Here_ features a meticulous recreation of the famous Bruno Ganz ""Hitler outburst"" scene from _Der Untergang_. There we have a cinematic sendup to complement all the countless YouTube subtitled mutations.) Among supporting actors in smaller but memorable roles, I was impressed by Thomas Thieme as the TV boss, and Gudrun Ritter as Grandma._Look Who's Back_ offers a great mixture of scripted dialogue and scenes and ""hidden camera"", Sacha Baron Cohen-like unscripted scenes. These are mixed so well that sometimes, you're not quite sure whether you're watching the former or the latter. See Hitler's visit of NPD headquarters, produced in the style of real-life documentaries, hand-held cameras and all.The satire in _Look Who's Back_ is biting: Hitler gets beat up by Neo-Nazis, because they assume he must be making fun of Hitler. And the German TV population, so apparently ready to embrace a second coming of Hitler, is only taken aback (temporarily?) when they see Hitler mistreating a little dog. Kindness towards fellow humans is perhaps not a given in Germany, but it's the German love of dogs that is truly unconditional.I haven't read the book yet, but it appears that the movie was suitably and in certain respects, significantly altered compared to the book, but with the best possible outcome. Depending on the credits source, up to 6 various writers may have worked on the screenplay, including the director Wnendt and the book writer Timur Vermes, and this carefulness has paid its dividends.",positive

Spectacle,"I was damn excited for a movie with the deadly combo of Imtiaz Ali and Ranbir Kapoor including AR Rahman (cherry on top). I loved Rockstar, it was among one of my favorites in 2011.

There was a constant smile stuck on my face throughout its 139 min of runtime. Ranbir Kapoor's performance literally gave me awe-bumps (you know like goosebumps). Dayum, he's an excellent actor cum artist. Deepika was magnificent. And the songs, man. Each and everyone of it is bound to snug around your ears throughout the year.Now let me get this straight, those who criticize this masterpiece are the same audience who disliked Rockstar, not because it was bad or something, it's just that they don't get it. They do not understand these kinda films. It's a piece of art. And I don't blame my fellow Indian audience to not to get along with these musical dramas, 'cuz they're way more inclined to commercial movies and the basic recipe of Bollywood masala crap. It's their comfort zone, and these movies make them uncomfortable.Well, I'm shocked seeing negative remarks or even mixed reviews on such an extravagant cinema.

Early Man,"My family and I have been long-time fans of Aardman productions - Wallace and Gromit, Chicken Run, Pirates!, etc. Aardman Studios produces some of the very best stop-motion animation around, but ""Early Man"" was a clear miss. How do I know? Here's how...1) Within the first 10 minutes my wife and sister-in-law couldn't take any more and left the theater, they jumped ship to watch a different movie instead.
2) The best thing my college-aged son and daughter had to say about the movie as we were walking out was that ""at least we got some popcorn out of the deal."" BTW, they both grew up with and love Wallace and Gromit, and Aardman. 
3) The traditionally inventive, fresh feel of Aardman projects didn't happen, this project was stale and trite. The story development was weak and character development was even weaker. 
4) The entire story line was entirely predictable, there were no surprises at all. 
5) The charm of earlier Aardman projects was that they worked equally well for adults and children...not so this film. The few jokes that were in ""Early Man"" would go right over the heads of children and they were largely not that funny for adults. I had maybe one genuine laugh the entire movie. I do have to say that the idea of a championship soccer match between two groups thinly veiled as Brits and French was noteworthy. 
6) What's the film like? My daughter probably summed it up best, ""Chicken Run"" in reverse, but neither memorable nor funny. Animation quality = 10

The Angriest Man in Brooklyn,"Stupendously bad. I have never seen so much talent in such a dreadful movie. One reviewer said it was like a video, badly shot with hung over actors at a rehearsal going wrong! I could not believe my eyes as talented actor after actor showed up in scenes and they were all so bad. It makes me truly think that directors, writers, and producers are the real stars in movies. This movie so so badly done on so many levels. who to blame? That is what I was thinking. Sometimes bad movies are fun to watch to see how bad they are, but this one was just cringe-worthy. There was not one moment where you were not very aware that you were watching a movie gone very wrong, and they all felt like they were ""acting"". The film looks cheap on all levels too. If you want to watch it just to see why it has so many bad reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, have a go. You want to have your FF handy though to buzz through it fast. I wonder if they all knew how bad it was while they were making it?",negative
The Angriest Man in Brooklyn,"I read many bad reviews of this picture and wasn't expecting much, but The Angriest Man in Brooklyn surprised me. It's a well-acted story with substance - a bittersweet tale of life as it is and life as it can be. The very strong cast included cameos by a stuttering James Earl Jones and a piggish Louis C.K. Yes, it's sentimental, but it's not sloppy about it. It's humorous without big laughs. It's quiet and subtle and altogether outstanding. It reminds us that the only normal people are the ones we don't really know. It shows us how important it is to try to be happy. Not your typical Hollywood, thank goodness.Portraying a man whose bad day has gone on for years, Robin Williams' performance is eerily grave. He is complemented by a strong cast and a simple story that makes its point. Well worth the price of the ticket, The Angriest Man in Brooklyn is a little gem.",positive
Next Gen,"First off. The good. Robots are pretty awesome. Some silly robots like the noodle bots and the toothbrush bot but generally they are cool. Especially the main robot. They are well incorporated into a futuristic background that doesn't seem too far off. However. The major let down is the highly unlikeable lead. She is a terrible character with nothing but rottenness in her personality. She is a bully, and unkind. And she justifies that because ""oh her father left when she was younger"". So it is just acceptable that she acts up, hurts others, blames all her misfortunes on everyone else, play guilt mind games. She never learns from her mistakes instead takes it out on everyone else around her. She is not even a little self aware nor does she accepts any responsibility for her own actions. She does not have any redeemable quality. As you watch the movie, instead of making you feel sympathetic to her and engage in her adventure, I find that I am filled with so much hate for her that I actually want to see her fail. I want her to be punished, and that does not make a good story if it makes the viewers hate the lead and want to see her fail! I find myself rooting for the villian and that almost never happens!If the story was just about the robot it would have been 10 stars.",negative
Next Gen,"Aside from the film involving robots with feelings this is far from Big Hero 6. I love BH6 and this film is definitely up there with it.

Her actions were intended to upset you and make you disagree with them so great job with that! Those that said the film is too violent are just being overly sensitive. Look at all the kids films/shows out there that are just as violent, if not more - Power Rangers, DragonBallZ,Tom & Jerry, TMNT, The Lion King, etc - Stop being so sensitive people. I thought Momo the dog was the highlight of the show. The beeping was hilarious and we don't really know what is being said, we're just assuming it was cussing but it really added a lot of humor to the film.I really liked how the film depicted humans as being so dependent and addicted to the robots, much like how we are so addicted to our phones and other technology now.

Monster Trucks,"I'm actually quite surprised Chris Wedge, the director who gave us the first Ice Age and Robots giving us his first live action family feature. Now it might have looked good on paper and could have possibly been better as an animated feature but this movie is a monster shame. X-Men's Havoc, Lucas Till takes the lead role as disgruntled, unhappy teenage Tripp who works at the local scrapyard which also serves his hobby of building his own truck. Jane Levy impressed me earlier this year with Don't Breathe and it's hard to believe that they're both the same actress, here being the sweet yet geeky town girl who has a keen interest in Tripp. It's a silly plot for a silly film but is too far fetched and weak with too many plot holes in surprised the film stayed together. Strange and undiscovered, intelligent creatures accidentally get released from their underground habitat. Feasting on oil and having an unlikely ability to power vehicles, basically a slimy horse with a metal shell. There's a few surprises of a supporting cast with me thinking ""oh look, it's so and so"" but none help prop up the all-round poor performance. I actually wonder what convinced them to star in this film. It must have been tricky to come up with a monster that's grotesque yet cute and friendly at the same in the end resembling a Jabba the Hutt with the characteristics of Toothless and E.T. Actually the films has some elements of both previously mentioned but more Iron Giant and Mac And Me. The special effects were good, not perfect but served the film well enough. The stunt driving was impressive and offers the most fun in the story as the film lacked any real comedy value. The soundtrack is okay but nothing memorable from David Sardy.It's possible this film was doomed from the beginning having problems with post-production that kept pushing the release dates back to well over a year. Even Nickelodeon had pulled out at one stage. It's unfortunately a step backwards for Wedge and for everyone involved. This might be a film they could possibly want to forget about but, it actually serves a purpose and the much younger audiences actually seemed to enjoy it. But I'm sorry Wedge, if the future of your live action films end up like this, I suggest sticking to the drawing board. It's brainless and more for the younger geeks among us. Running Time: 4 The Cast: 6 Performance: 4 Direction: 3 Story: 3 Script: 3 Creativity: 4 Soundtrack: 4 Job Description: 2 The Extra Bonus Points: -5 for being a terrible idea even for a kid's film. 28% 3/10",negative
Monster Trucks,"I took my youngest child, six years old (nearly seven), to see this yesterday.

There's not a lot to the story, so if you've seen the trailer you won't be surprised. The monsters straddle the line well between being ""monstrous"" and cute (my boy acted suitably scared until it became clear that the monsters were on the good side, after which he loved them).He came out of the cinema asking when it would be available on DVD, so on balance a glowing recommendation from a 6 year old and a warm fuzzy one from me.",positive

New guy inexplicably falls for her, they have sex, she gets pregnant, decides to have an abortion, eventually tells him, he says nothing but supports her by going with her to the clinic, and then they start to watch Gone With the Wind (although where are the bells in the opening soundtrack of GWTW?). Sadly, the Jenny Slate character doesn't seem to have any redeeming qualities. Self-pity is not a redeeming quality. There is no indication whatsoever as to why the guy falls for her, other than the fact that she seems to be available and drunk. And I have to say the abrupt ending threw me. Soafter spending almost two hours of my life, what's my takeaway here? Abortion good, hard work bad? Some guys will date almost anyone? What's the point in trying because I can't be as good as my mother? If this was indeed about abortion, as some seem to think, it doesn't get much air timeJenny says ""I thought about it"" and leaves it at that. We have no indication as to what thoughts entered her mind. The guy has no say. Really? The only likable character was her mother: was this to remind us that that ""Thirty-Something"" (where the actress gained fame and fortune) was actually a far superior show about young people? And I'm sorry, but why the title? ""Obvious Child""? Who's the child? Jenny? If it's the aborted baby, why on earth is he/she obvious? And if it's Jenny, are we supposed to celebrate that fact that she's 28 or so and totally clueless? Is that a good thing? Sorry, thumbs way down from me.",negative
Obvious Child,"Over the years, the film industry has churned out plenty of comedies about the perils of dealing with unexpected pregnancy, but never has the subject been approached from such a refreshingly different point of view than in Gillian Robespierre's Obvious Child. Donna (Jenny Slate) is an aspiring stand-up comedian whose relationship with her long-term boyfriend has just come to a screeching halt, courtesy of his philandering. Angry and despondent, Donna unleashes her frustration onstage, crashing and burning in front of the audience before finding solace in genuine nice guy Max (Jake Lacy), with whom she shares a few drinks - and a bed.When Donna discovers a few weeks later that she's pregnant, her life is thrown into upheaval. A child certainly isn't on her list of desired acquisitions, and after evaluating her options with best friend Nellie (Gaby Hoffmann), she elects to have an abortion. There's just one problem: Max, the one-night stand who also happens to be the sweetest, most courteous person Donna has ever met, and is obviously interested in more than just a casual fling.Obvious Child differs from other pregnancy rom-coms by approaching a uniquely feminine issue from a decidedly feminine point of view. This is Donna's story, and while the film is most definitely a comedy, it treats the subject matter with respect and dignity. It's also a standout performance from Slate, who runs the full gamut of the emotional spectrum, gleefully reveling in Donna's raunchy stand-up act one moment, and losing herself in a tearjerking scene between Donna and her overbearing (but not unloving) mother in the next.Obvious Child will likely bear the unfortunate distinction of being known as ""the abortion movie,"" but to oversimplify the film and marginalize it in such a manner is a huge disservice. Yes, it deals with abortion, but more importantly, it deals with womanhood in a way that few films have ever dared. It's an authentic, emotional, and yes, hilarious portrait of a young woman trying to find her way, and should be considered a landmark achievement in feminist filmmaking.-- Brent Hankins",positive
Infinitely Polar Bear,"I really thought this movie could be awesome, I love Mark Ruffalo, Zoe Saldana's pretty cool, the kids looked cute and I love indie movies and movies that are set in the 70s. But there really wasn't much to like about this film.As a previous reviewer said, the way that manic depression is depicted in this movie is too glib. Having a severely mentally ill person as the guardian of two children is more of a tragedy than a comedy. The movie kind of suggested that having a bipolar parent would be like a fun roller coaster ride with lots of exciting moments and singing.The most surprising element of this movie was that the children's characters were made to be so unlikeable. The two girls were extremely self-absorbed, cruel, and annoying towards their mentally ill father. I kept thinking that I would also go insane if I had those two for daughters. They whined and complained through the entire movie. The mentally ill dad would try to do something positive, and his daughters would scream at him, put him down, tell him his ideas were stupid and refuse to help. They seemed to be actively provoking him at times.I didn't get the point of this movie. I liked the costumes and the set design, but the story was really sub-par.",negative
Infinitely Polar Bear,"In the late 70's, in Boston, the bipolar Cameron ""Cam"" Stuart (Mark Ruffalo) lives with his mulatto wife Maggie (Zoe Saldana) and their daughters Amelia (Imogene Wolodarsky) and Faith (Ashley Aufderheide) in an isolated house in the countryside. When Cam is fired from his job, he has a mental breakdown and Maggie is forced to institutionalize him. When he is released, he moves to a small apartment while Maggie works to support the children. She decides to apply to an MBA to improve her income and she is accepted by the Columbia University in New York. She asks Cam to take care of the girls for eighteen months and he agrees despite his fears. Maggie moves to New York and Cam is responsible for Amelia and Faith education. Will the scheme work?""Infinitely Polar Bear"" is a heartwarming film with outstanding performances. The dramatic situation of Cameron is shallow, but the movie is delightful to watch. Just as a curiosity, the girl Imogene Wolodarsky is the daughter of the director Maya Forbes. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Sentimentos que Curam"" (""Feelings that Heel"")",positive
The Little Death,"I'd turn up the rating on this film to 11 if my amp went that high: it's really that good. Superlatives are overused and not always helpful, so I'll give some comparative praise: it's the first film to make me laugh harder than either Mel Brooks' ""Young Frankenstein"" or the 'Bigus Dickus' scene in Monty Python's ""Life of Brian""... It was as touching and romantic as ""Love Actually"" or Baz Luhrman's ""Moulin Rouge"" (if not more so); had as many wrenching and completely unpredictable twists and turns as the best of Hitchcock, and the ending had a twist guaranteed to be as surprising as anything you've seen—except that the end first took a quick 90-degree turn before hitting you with a 180. The writer-director, Josh Lawson, has produced a truly perfect little masterpiece with ""The Little Death"", full of subtlety, whimsy, good humor and genuinely side-splitting comedy. It's not for everyone, but I can't recommend this film highly enough.",negative
The Little Death,"The first thing I did after watching the film was check social media - was it just me or did everyone else agree this was a great flick? Happily it wasn't just me, I couldn't find a bad tweet. Yes, it's an awkward topic, and not that I'm a prude but I did have trepidations about going to see a movie about sexual fetishes. But actually, that's what gave it it's humour, along with the incredible performances by not one, but every single cast member. At no time did I wish that we went back to one of the other story lines because each one was engaging in its own right. The film somehow manages to be light hearted and appealing to adults of all ages, while at the same time meandering through sophisticated undertones and delivering a few thought provoking messages. This is not just a fantastic example of Australian talent, it is a brilliant movie.",positive
The Art of the Steal,"It seems like forever since I saw Kurt Russell in something. I almost thought he was retired. Then I saw this at my local theater and realized Kurt is still rocking the old Snake Plissken hair style. That's OK, caused it works for him, and despite sporting the hair do for more than thirty years, it makes him look young and vibrate. As the title suggest, Kurt plays an experience thief. More precise he's Crunch Calhoun, a wheel man in a crew that also has his half-brother, Nicky Calhoun played by Matt Dillon as a member and Idea man. On their last Heist, Nicky gets caught and rats on his brother to stay out of Jail.After serving his time, Crunch becomes a struggling daredevil who gets pulled back into the game by his no good brother, who stumbles upon the ultimate Art Heist. That's how the title of the film doubles its cleverness, their a crew of experience art thieves, but that's where the cleverness really stops. I don't know if it's because everyone played their roles so dead on or because everyone was phoning in their performances for a pay check, but the film is way too predictable. The film follows the heist formula to the letter, and attempts to throw you off the scent, particularly with Jay Baruchel's character Francie, a thief who befriends Crunch at a time when the man was living on the up and up, and Katheryn Winnick who plays Crunch's girlfriend, Lola whose character's agenda could have kept me on the edge of my seat caused of a semi-love Triangle she created between Crunch and Nicky, but her character would have needed to be more developed to accomplish that. With the exception of Lola, The movie stands mostly on how interesting the actors made the characters they played. Watching them interact with each other was the best part. Like with veteran actor, Terrance Stamp playing a paroled ex-art thief force to work with a bumbling Interpol agent assigned to catch the crew doing something wrong in order to win his freedom. It is worth taking a gander at just to see Russell (and his hair), pal around with some interesting characters played by some decent actors, but it's nothing to go out of your way to see.",negative
The Art of the Steal,"This was WAAAAYYYY better than what I thought it was going to be. There are very few movies I don't like of Kurt Russell's but the rest of the cast was pretty awesome too. The comedy part that stood out to me was the banter of Terence Stamp. Funny stuff there! If you like Jay Baruchel's acting, you'll get some great scenes with him too. Especially when he had the beard on at the border crossing. Wasn't any nudity that I could think of which is always a bummer but good for the kids. While not action packed like Italian Job or movies of the sort, it was still a great watch. Definitely stay for the end credits as there are some out takes.",positive

The Love Punch,"This was an amusing film - but nothing more than that really. In my humble opinion it fell short in a number of ways and missed out on several opportunities to play on the 'middle age/getting older/struggling-to-cope-with-the-modern-world' jokes. When it did do this however, it was very funny - but there were never really those laugh-out-loud moments that one would have hoped to find in a film with a cast of such combined considerable talent and experience. Unfortunately, there seemed to be this constant feeling that the four main actors involved (Emma Thompson, Pierce Brosnan) were holding back and could have done better - although it has to be said that the chemistry between all four (and most especially Thompson and Brosnan as ex-spouses) worked really well. However, the stunning locations of Paris and the French Riviera definitely help with taking your mind off the rather silly plot; I ignorantly didn't realize parts of France are so stunningly beautiful. Emma Thompson in particular does her very best with the weak material, proving, as if I didn't already know, that she is one of the most versatile and talented actresses around.But, for me, the film's main surprise is Timothy Spall! He was the funniest guy in this comedy, in my opinion he really stole the show from Emma and Pierce together, he had some really funny jokes and his character is really peculiar and strange.. I loved it! Anyway, the script for this film seemed to 'fall between two stalls' as it were and was neither one thing or the other, resulting in a sort of grey hit-and-miss humour and genre. Perhaps it just tried too hard to be clever and witty, and it may have just been a simple case of 'less is more' - it certainly seemed to thrum along at a fair pace and complexity of plot.Overall rating: 6 out of 10.",negative
The Love Punch,"Emma Thompson and Pierce Brosnan play a divorced couple whose retirement funds and savings are stolen by an unscrupulous French businessman. They enlist the help of their good friends, played by Timothy Spall and Celie Imrie, to carry out a plan to recover what they lost. It's a far-fetched, crazy plot involving kidnap, scuba-diving, impersonation, jewel theft, and wedding-crashing. The zany plot contrasts nicely with the normal, suburban lives lived by the main characters. Oddly enough, even with the outlandish plot, the ending is predictable. That may be due to the fact that it's really a romantic comedy dressed up in an adventure. This movie is likable, but stops short of being great.This is one of my favourite Emma Thompson roles, largely because she has resisted her frequent tendency to over-act. She has a couple of really wonderful lines, most notably ""we should nick it"", delivered exactly right. Pierce Brosnan does a believable job of playing the aging hunk who is starting to realize he's not 21 anymore. The movie is not hilarious, but does deliver several laughs. Thompson and Brosnan are funny together, particularly the scene in Paris in which Thompson cannot believe that Brosnan's driving skills have not improved over the years.Despite silly plot failings, this movie is worth watching simply to see four really good lead actors show us how it's done.",positive
Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety,"According to the movie's perspective, marriage will break the bro-code between besties Sonu and Titu. The two chaddi buddies aren't lovers but they are emotional soul mates. Director Luv Ranjan goes a step further - the entire film is about a friend trying to break up his best friend's marriage because he believes that the woman his friend is marrying is a fraud. Sonu has no proof that Sweety is problematic. He says, it's just a feeling. She is, in his words, too good to be true.
 The actors - Kartik Aaryan, Sunny Singh and Nushrat Bharucha - try to make this juvenile bromance versus romance drama convincing. Nushrat is saddled with an underwritten character. Kartik works hard to make Sonu likeable but it's an uphill climb. Sunny is the best among the three - he has an easy, unassuming presence. I just wish his character had more spine.In once scene, Sweety tells Sonu that dosti aur ladki mein hamesha ladki jeetti hai. But in the Luv Ranjan's universe, women don't stand a chance.",negative

Mistress America,"For those who saw Frances Ha, the film's overall writing style and pacing will not be a surprise. Saying that however, it doesn't overdo the ""cleverness"" in the same way Frances Ha did, and overall it kind of works better. Greta Gerwig has never been better. She really steals every second of her screen time and is really just such a marvel to watch. She infuses her own acting style to this in a different way, so it doesn't really feel like any of her other characters. The whole cast here is aces, and it leads to such a great work from the entire ensemble at Mimi Rose's house. I definitely recommend this. It's fast and it's a marvel to watch the characters say the dialogue in such a fun, quick way.",negative
Mistress America,"There are several reasons why Mistress America may be considered a wonderful movie. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and has a very sophisticated sense of humour. The main actors all have exaggerated characters that always behave in certain ways (kind of like the cast in The Office) -- and the actors play these roles to perfection.The writing and delivery of dialogue in the climax of the film is particularly amazing, with fast, witty exchanges filled with little jokes. Yet, the movie vacillates from hilarity to melancholy without warning the viewer, which makes the film all the more special.The depiction of and commentary on NYC, youth, etc. is all spot on, making this movie worth the watch.Finally, the soundtrack is excellent too, giving the movie a very alt/indie feel. Many negative reviewers sadly fail to appreciate the sophisticated writing and humour, along with the truly wonderful job that the lead actors have done in this unpretentious flick.",positive
Jue di tao wang,"I know the modern millennials, the intellectually inept, and also the emotionally unstable will not get it, but this little gem is a return to a time when movies meant to entertain rather than degrade.Yes the acting is simple and fun, but this isn't a history piece. Yes the story line is quick and nostalgically pure, but it isn't a melodrama. But here's what this film is not: it is not full of disgusting pornography and unnecessarily perverted innuendos to keep today's ""youth"" entertained by pulling on their neanderthal limbic responses to get a bite. There is no blood or gore as we see it today that can ruin even an adult psyche by today's idea of cinematic ""morals"". It does not inject politically correct ethical impurities to persuade those of lesser IQ and mental instinct to clap at every pop culture reference toward popular political brainwashing dogmas. It does not pretend to be anything but what it is, a wholesome and entertaining flick. It is what movies used to be like and what I respect Jackie Chan for continuing to do even today, and that is make movies that a normal set of parents can go see with their adolescent kids and not worry of at any second two men that look like women will try to force some insanity of pseudo logic and propaganda on my family. This movie reminds me of what movies were like when actors didn't get paid $30 million apiece (even if these actors did - who knows) just to show up and ""act"". This movie reminds me of when going to the movies meant joy and entertainment, even if it wasn't necessarily deep. perfect for families and it made me smile, because it brought back a touch of hope that maybe, just maybe, movies may one day return to a time when no agenda needed to be pushed and simple entertainment for a family audience was the only desired effect.This is not Citizen Kane or Casablanca, but I still give it highest marks for doing that which in today's chaotic time of violence, filth, greed and social degradation may be considered ""boring"" by people who have passed the event horizon of stupidity. That alone earns it a ten in my book.There's hope.",negative
Jue di tao wang,"Look, I am a huge Jackie Chan fan and I have seen quite a few of his films that were accessible to American audiences. He has done some remarkable movies in his day. Anyone the hasn't seen Police Story 1 or 2 is missing some of the most hardcore action ever put to film. Legend of the Drunken Master is a classic film. Project A, Armour of the Gods, Rumble in the Bronx, Rush Hour, and on and on and on. I love Jackie Chan.This film however is bad. I mean capital B A D. The action sequences are poorly filmed. The dialogue is terrible. The story progression is horrendous. The acting is atrocious. I wanted to like this movie...I really did. Jackie Chan has broken down so many barriers. His comedic style is something that has given me laughs upon laughs for years.

Get a Job,"How the likes of Miles Teller, Anna Kendrick, Bryan Cranston, Marcia Gay Harden, Alison Brie, John C. McGinley, and Brandon T. Jackson, all most talented actors, can be in such a stinkeroo is a mystery to me. I'm no prude, but when a film is incredibly vulgar and mean-spirited and the intended humor falls flat as a pancake it just becomes torturous to watch. The customary 180 at the end of the film was way too little and way too late.I saw some reviewers state that this movie was ""in the can"" for 4 years before being released. Why inflict us now?

Want to overcome racism, try not promoting it and reminding everybody every second of the day about it. I'm by no way in hell a racist, so please let's not jump to conclusions.

Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, I am a huge Johnny Knoxville fan. I find him hilarious and his films are great. Bad Grandpa is no exception. Bad Grandpa is hilarious, original, and has a few heartfelt moments.The acting is very good. Johnny Knoxville plays a very convincing old man who is hilarious and says some very outrageous things. Jackson Nicoll also performs very well. He has great comedic timing and, like Johnny Knoxville, is willing to say anything. The use of real people is another great aspect of the film.The pacing is fast but slows town towards the end. The runtime is just perfect.All of the jokes are funny and the stunts are all real.Pros: Hilarious story, good acting by Johnny Knoxville and Jackson Nicoll, great use of real people, fast pacing, a good runtime, and all of the jokes and stunts were funnyCons: Some slow pacing towards the endOverall Rating: 8.2",negative
Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa,"This is so much funnier than it should be. There were times in this movie that I just could not stop laughing. The people are all real, only the boy, and Knoxville and a select few are plants, the rest of this is like an insane episode of Just For Laughs out of Montreal, or the little shorts you see on a Jackass movie, just going on for the whole movie. Mostly skits like Letterman would do, but some far more toward the Chris Elliott side. You will hate yourself for laughing at parts of this movie, and there is just no getting around that, it is the basest humour, but it is done so well, and with that kid making everything feel just that little bit worse. I really Enjoyed this movie, I did not think I would, I was not expecting this sort of thing when I started watching it, and was surprised that the format is so much like Borat even, just not quite as far (or further)depends on your views. I would bet though no matter who you are, or how delicate your sensibilities, there is something in this movie that will have you on the floor, or at least holding your sides, and gasping for air. Anything that makes me laugh this hard gets a 10 as long as I was able to hold down my lunch. (a point was nearly lost, and so was my lunch)Jesse of www.jesse.ca",positive
Bajrangi Bhaijaan,"I went to see BB on the day of release with my wife and 17 year old son. I'm not Indian or Pakistani, but white British, so it was fun sat in a cinema full of Pakistanis, to watch a film that could have painted Pakistani in a negative light.Judging by the murmuring I could her there did seem to be some people during the interval that were not too impressed with the film - slow, boring, blah, blah - but by the end I think everyone left happy.From a white British guys perspective I thought it was a terrific film, and so did my wife and son. Great story, interesting characters, a ridiculously cute kid who stole the show without saying very much, excellent music, and some scenery that took your breath away.I thought Salman Kahn was great, much more three dimensional than I was expecting. Kareena Kapoor provided a massive dose of eye-candy and played her part well too, although it would have been nice for that part to have been developed more.But for me the star of the show - other than Harshaali Malthotra, the little girl - was definitely Nawazuddin Siddiqui. He is one of the most mesmerising actors I've ever seen. He could read the label of a sauce bottle and have everyone transfixed.In typical Bollywood style the first half was your typical setting-the-scene, which I thought was done very well, and it kept me interested throughout, but after the interval, as soon as Nawazuddin Siddiqui made his appearance, the film took off and didn't let-up until the end.All-in-all a thoroughly enjoyable film for all the family.",negative
Bajrangi Bhaijaan,"Despite being a Salman fan I was not too impressed with some of his recent flicks which in my humble opinion lacked freshness or had mindless direction, so when a family member bought tickets for this movie I didn't go in with high expectations. But to you dear reader I'll say GO WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS! It will not disappoint! And more importantly go with your heart - that is all you need for this 2.5 hours long film to become one of the best you've seen in years. It's just one of those movies with such heart-tugging moments and the highlight - the bond between Pawan (Salman) and Shahida (Harshali) - which is such a delight to see that you forget all about plot, logic, direction - not to say that the movie lacks that. The perfection in execution is definitely there, especially in the second-half. I watched it in the AVX theatre with at least 500 others and from the sound of it at least 75% of them regardless of age or gender were crying from the intermission onwards - sometimes because it was sad and other times because the screenplay was just so pure and unfiltered that it just made these happy tears bubble up inside of you.There is a certain level of comedy throughout and definitely some deep witty one-liners. My favourite was from Nawazuddin Sidduiqi (who played his role to perfection) who pointing at the current state of the media and their polarization of India and Pakistan proclaimed that ""Hatred sells. Mohabbat doesn't."" The movie has depth, a message, and the cuteness overload that is Harshali Malhotra. It also has a relationship and emotions so simple yet so extraordinary that they make a hero out of a common man. :)",positive
War on Everyone,"The trouble with John Michael McDonagh is that he's not half as clever as he thinks he is or that he would like us to think he is. If he was really smart he wouldn't be making pretentious crap like ""War on Everyone"". This should have been just another buddy cop movie with a lineage that goes all the way back to the seventies but that would have been too common-place for a man like McDonagh, the much less talented brother of playwright and filmmaker Martin McDonagh.""War on Everyone"" is a semi-serious, name-dropping, (from feminism, the classics, literature, the movies, popular music; the kind of things 'smart' people are supposed to know about), buddy movie, all done in the worst possible taste which isn't a problem in itself; I love bad taste when it's funny but this just isn't funny. On the plus side, the ridiculously handsome Alexander Skarsgard, (son of Stellan), who plays one half of our pair of anti-heroes, shows that given a half decent script he might even be able to deliver the goods. Otherwise, that's about it. Don't waste your time.",negative

The Rewrite,"Early this year, this reviewer went to see the 2013 film 'Love Is the Perfect Crime', a French-language film about a student-seducing literature professor, with plenty of bloody murder and mayhem. By contrast 'The Rewrite', from Castle Rock, is a gentle comedy set in the academic world of Binghamton, New York.'The Rewrite' tells the story of a washed-up script-writer who is forced to take up a job teaching script-writing. The decent trailer for this film shows this, and the selection procedure for the class, which we quickly get to, and so gives you a good idea what to expect in the film. Hugh Grant plays the part of this writer-turned-teacher.Hugh Grant has previously given us classic comedies, such as 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' (1994), 'Mickey Blue Eyes' and 'Notting Hill' both of 1999, and 'About a Boy' (2002). In 'AaB', Mr Grant played a one-hit-wonder pop-star trying to fill the rest of his life, so this role is somewhat similar.In a recent interview Mr Grant described how his life had taken a dramatic change in recent years, which forced him into political activity, thus also forcing him into having a much lesser role in the movie business. With regard to 'The Rewrite', Mr Grant said that audience reaction now made him realize that his age prevented him from playing certain scenes, and one true-life scene had him looking back unable to capture his former glory.Thus this film, 'The Rewrite', in reality, can be seen as a turning point, where the previously foppish young Hugh Grant, has now turned into the now mature Hugh Grant. This real-life journey for Mr Grant, is one that is also faced by his character in this film, thus does the art imitate real-life.The realistic scenario for this film was written by Marc Lawrence, who previously wrote the classic 'Miss Congeniality' (2000). One cannot help wonder how autobiographical the one-hit-wonder script-writer plot is. Certainly all the Hollywood-related scenes have a truly authentic feel to them. Marc Lawrence, who directed, as well as wrote, this film, and actor Hugh Grant, have given us a vision of life that seems very believable.What must be stated, is how good Mr Lawrence's script is. Nearly every line is clever and funny, though if you laugh-out-loud you may miss the next line. There are also some poignant moments in the film too, and these are expertly directed, and are expertly conveyed to us, sometimes just by using silence. Tremendous! Director Marc Lawrence is Brooklyn-born, as is leading-lady Marisa Tomei. Miss Tomei did the lovely rom-coms 'My Cousin Vinny' (1992) and 'Only You' (1994). In more recent years, she did the more serious 'Before The Devil Knows You Are Dead' (2007) and 'The Wrestler' (2008). Miss Tomei turned down appearing in the 1994 film 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'. Here, at last, she plays opposite Hugh Grant.Miss Tomei's character is an optimistic and pushy mature-student, with a very full life. However, unlike Jason Alexander's 'Seinfeld' character George Costanza, who admitted ""I have a thing for Marisa Tomei"" in 'Seinfeld' (Series 7, Episode 14), Hugh Grant's student-seducing character strangely seems unable to lift his eyes from the young bit-of-skirt to see Marisa Tomei. ""What's not to like!"" as George would say. NB Castle Rock made 'Seinfeld'.The plot of 'The Rewrite' has our jaded LA-based script-writer relocating to small-town Binghamton. Thus, it is similar in theme to 'Groundhog Day' (1993), in which the jaded weather-man has to leave New York to meet Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog, in ""rural Pennsylvania"". How appropriate it is then that this similar rom-com plot, again has Chris Elliott in a supporting role.There is also good support from the supporting-cast who make up the motley-crew of the screen-writing class. Serious actor JK Simmons, who has appeared regularly in several of the Law & Order TV franchises, and who terrified us in the TV series 'Oz', here gets to do some touching comedy. Allison Janney too, gives strong support.Australian-born Bella Heathcote has the biggest part in the writing-class, and she acts it well, but perhaps the more poignant scenes were with Andrew Keenan-Bolger, and particularly, Steven Kaplan, who was in the best scene in the film.The clever and funny script teaches us a little about the English language, script-writing, and life in general. Suitable to those in education, and also those interested in film-making, as well as all others, this film is surprisingly realistic, and has a clever and funny script, as well as some thought-provoking moments.What's not to like! 10/10.PS. Jumping out of my seat at the start of the credits, this reviewer nearly missed some nice scenes that accompanied the credits, so do stay to catch them, as they are well worth seeing.",negative
The Rewrite,"Hugh Grant is an icon and icons get older too, like the rest of us mortals. Here's a wonderful movie portraying a 'has been' screenplay writer in Hollywood struggling through life, divorced and no clue how to be a dad to his 18 year old son, which he didn't speak to for over a year. He hits rock bottom and is forced to teach at a remote university upstate New York to pay his bills.In the bumpy process through it all he realizes that teaching gives him a true perspective on his own life and enjoyment for being valued by his students. He finds peace in not juggling anymore in Tinseltown. The script is magnificent, it tells a story through a comic lens with a melodramatic touch. It's a a classic romantic comedy with lots of nice movie clichés. Hugh Grant didn't loose his touch, he matured and accepts it, the floppy hair turned grey. Excellent casting by the way. Nice to see Marisa Tomei, Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons in a supporting role.",positive
Zero,Who thought this would make a good film? None of the people working on the film ever had this thought? I had to walk out during the second half because of how absurd it was,negative
Zero,"Forget what the critic is saying , this might be a movie the critics will not like but the fan they will definitely like it. It's a different approach taken by Anand L rai and charismatic srk. With the combination of anushka and katrina , the movie gets back on the line. When the trailer came out we all thought it will be a huge comedy, but it's not just a comedy it's a very very emotional movie.I would like to urge people go to cinema and watch this beautiful film.",positive
Table 19,"Trailers are notorious in over-promising for movies that under-deliver. But every now and then, one pops up that does the opposite. The trailer for Table 19 (2017) gives the impression of a lightweight romantic comedy with a touch of slapstick, all framed around a wedding. Despite being critically panned by many, there is more to this unexpectedly entertaining low-profile film than meets the eye.The heroine is Eloise (Anna Kendrick) who, against her better judgement, accepts a wedding invitation knowing she is persona non-grata with the bridal party. She was recently dumped by the bride's brother, who is now the best man, and she is suddenly no longer the bride's best friend. She was the chief helper with the reception planning and knows who is at every table and why they are here. Her companions on Table 19 comprise a lovable granny-type, two oddballs, and a quarrelling married couple. They were all expected to decline their invitation but still send a gift, and that alone is a recipe for humour and satire. Their distance from the bridal table and proximity to the toilets quickly establishes their lowly social status and the comic sketches play on social awkwardness. The thread of continuity is through Eloise and her manhunts. The standard sit-com one-liners and the obligatory near-catastrophe with a wedding cake are neither original nor particularly funny, but the situation develops a warm emotional undercurrent that is unexpectedly touching.One of the interesting things about this film is the difference between its plot and story. The plot is standard wedding reception comedy which laughs at the marginalisation of unwanted guests. On the other hand, the story explores why the Table 19'ers are together. It offers insight into their lives, their personalities, and the emotional hurt caused by being placed on the social fringe. The best part of the film is when the offended ""randoms"" leave the reception for a while to console each other. Through flashbacks we get the back-story to their invitations which range from pathetic to comic. For example, the granny-type really believed she was invited because the bride fondly remembered her first baby-sitter, but the bride barely knows who she is. There is also a wannabe trying to lose his virginity, a weird guy straight out of prison, and a couple who are far from an inspiring example of a loving marriage.Anna Kendrick plays the perfect balance between awkward, aggrieved, and aggressive, and the randoms are standard comic stereotypes. But while our eyes are on Elosie, the warmth of the story come from her table companions. The gags are at snicker level rather than belly laughs and the cinematography is colourful and cluttered as wedding receptions often are. There is no shortage of embarrassing moments as Eloise stalks her men, both old and new, and the final scenes rise through melodrama to operatic farce. But this film offers a fresh take on standard rom-com themes in amusing and entertaining ways. and it might make you think twice if you need to create a seating plan.",negative
Table 19,"I confess I find weddings tedious at the best of times but we always go with a sense of optimism.Anna Kendrick's character was clearly on the fence about attending but decided to be brave and attend. She is seated at the table of people who were surprised to get an invitation and we learn that she is the best man's ex-girlfriend and former Maid of Honour for this event.Nobody beautiful, rich or influential is at table 19. It turns out they are all at a turning point in their lives and the story evolves about their various crisis.These people are all amazing in their on right and their stories are interesting (far more interesting than any the beautiful people have).#The soundtrack is well chosen and the spark of sensuality provided when Huck and Eloise dance is well done.The wedding isn't dressed up as a great event - its an ordinary American wedding and thankfully, there is a limited amount of it.I can't recommend it highly enough, in a time when films have no script at all",positive
Little Evil,"There's very ""little"" good to say about this snore-fest. It tries to be funny but falls flat at every turn. Even the great, villainous Clancy Brown as the evil cult leader couldn't salvage this train wreck. The morbidly obese lesbian ""AL"" character dropped the F-Bomb every other word and was incredibly irritating as she called every male ""Bro!"" (in between F-Bombs). The mother was completely oblivious to the fact her son had brought complete destruction to all those around him, especially slaughtering former husbands and boyfriends. And the step-dad took forever and a ton of prodding to be convinced the kid (Lucas) was actually the anti-Christ.
And then, after being tortured and buried alive by Lucas, the step-dad gets chewed out by the mom for not caring for the emotional well-being of the pint-sized, psychotic, satanic little monster!?! Yeah, then the step-dad has some unequivocally idiotic change of heart and decides he's gonna love this murderous demon ""because you don't have to be like your real dad"" or some kinda BS even though Lucas has ALREADY committed countless atrocities and deaths! It ends on an even cheesier, dumb note that I won't even bother to explain. If you want a funny, scary movie you'd be much better served watching ""Army of Darkness"" again.",negative
Little Evil,"This film is hilariously entertaining if you recognize the intended allusions, particularly the nods to THE OMEN. Adam Scott and Owen Atlas are charming as step-father and son, especially in the water park scenes. Evangeline Lilly is surprisingly perfect as the ditsy mom; she delivers her lines with impeccable comic timing. I've never seen her outside of LOST and her performance here is spot-on. Yes, some bits are campy and silly, but the overall message is touching and relevant.",positive
Rock the Kasbah,"ROCK THE KASBAH (2015) ** Bill Murray, Leem Lubany, Bruce Willis, Kate Hudson, Zooey Deschanel, Scott Caan, Danny McBride, Arian Moayad, Fahim Fazli, Jona Khan. Misfire comedy with our boy Bill as a has been rock promoter up to his eyeballs in international intrigue as he attempts to comeback with a new performer en route to Afghanistan and instead winds up stranded with little opportunity until unlikely Lubany enters the picture as a native who has a golden voice (and a quick meal ticket for the greasy Murray having some fun in the process). Scribe Mitch Glazer and director Barry Levinson half-bake for a M*A*S*H like vibe despite the efforts of a blue-chip cast largely wasted. Disappointing to say the least but hey Bill makes the most of it.",negative
Rock the Kasbah,"Richie Lanz (Bill Murray) is a down-and-out music manager working out of a Van Nuys motel with his assistant Ronnie (Zooey Deschanel). He makes ends meet by conning money from gullible wannabes and booking bar mitzvah. They get recruited to an USO tour in Afganistan. The dangers freak out Ronnie and she runs away. Richie is befriended by irreverent amateur arms dealers Jake (Scott Caan) and Nick (Danny McBride). They take him to a club where he meets Miss Merci (Kate Hudson). Bombay Brian (Bruce Willis) arranged for Ronnie's departure and expects the other half of the money from Richie. Jake and Nick ropes Richie into a weapons run. With cab driver Riza as his translator, he finds his own Afghan Star.The start is fine. Bill Murray is great as this kind of lovable loser and Deschanel is adorably scared. There are a couple of awkward chuckles. Then it's a surprising parade of Hollywood stars. The laughs quickly disappear as the movie struggles with the clashing tones of sincerity and surreal comedy. Murray's wise-cracking only grinds the humor to a halt. This is a terribly flawed movie.",positive
One Cut of the Dead,"I just seen movie at ToHorror Festival, also with subtitle is an incredible movie, for everyone like horror, like to see backstage of movie, or work in this mad world.
It's very difficult to talk about this movie without doing spoiler, but i try to do it.
Acting : terrible enough to be enjoyable, and right to very realist
Shooting : double Dop for a double feature, both work fine to obtain the right result, a funny horror result.
Direction is very complex and i think Directors did a great work.
If like horror you must see it, without reading more about plot, to avoid to waste the suspence. Great Movie",negative
One Cut of the Dead,"Absolutely incredible! Who would have thought a zombie flick could be so unique, original and wildly entertaining - and that it could sidetrack you with the most audacious curve ball that will knock you out the park and some (twice).

Toni Erdmann,"Watching this movie feels like standing in a cool, empty room and looking at a piece of abstract modern art. It's bizarre, disturbing and confusing. You can try to analyse, what the filmmakers intentions were or what may symbolise something, if you like doing that. The most obvious message of the movie (spend more time with your family) appears quite trivial. Some parts are somewhat funny because of the extreme absurdness of the events (don't expect subtlety). The laughter, however, mostly sticks in your throat. The characters are hard to understand, let alone identify with. There are a lot of silent moments, in which you get the chance to feel into the characters, only you don't feel much more than awkwardness. If you're looking for entertainment or something to take from it, I recommend you don't watch this film. If you like ""art projects"", naked people or unorthodox film making, it may be of interest.",negative
Toni Erdmann,"Toni Erdmann starts slow and is in general a movie that takes its time. 162 minutes might suggest an overlong or very slow paced film, but in this 162 minutes we get a firework-like examination of a relationship between a father and a daughter. And yes, Toni Erdmann is a comedy. There are some moments that are so hilarious, that they gained applause mid film from the audience at my screening. But it is also a tragedy. A really complex one actually. There is so much loneliness in those characters, so much longing. Toni Erdmann is constantly entertaining, extremely well acted and emotionally compelling. A masterpiece of German cinema.",positive
Austenland,"Did you ever watch the first five minutes of a movie, and realize that for every ten more minutes you watched, your IQ would drop eleven points? Austenland is such a movie. When Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dumber were standing there at the airport and the ""nineteenth century"" taxi arrived, I knew if I saw the rest of this film I would wind up brain-dead. It isn't funny, except in ways that awful movies are funny in an unintended sort of way. In other words the writing, acting and directing are so bad you laugh your tutu off. Austenland is such a movie. There are wonderful comedies out there, fantastic period dramas and historical masterpieces. Austenland is not one of them. Avoid!",negative
Austenland,"I am not sure why this film has received such low reviews. The film opens up with Mrs. Wattlesbrook (Jane Seymour) holding a fake lamb and talking about Austenland, which I think greatly sets the tone for what type of movie this is going to be. Going into the film, I knew it had received a low score thus lowering my expectations greatly so I wasn't expecting much. It turns out I didn't need to lower my expectations, this film totally went over and above.The critics and everyone leaving a low score have no sense of humor! It's over the top, exaggerated, hilarious, ridiculous, it's supposed to be that way! None of it is believable and once you allow yourself to enter the world of Austenland, you'll enjoy the film. The theater possibly has a lot to do with the tone. We had a great audience, everyone was cracking up, loud uproars in all the scenes, it was hilarious. Miss Elizabeth Charming is hysterical! I really enjoyed Jennifer Coolidge's performance, she really did her usual thing and it was wonderful. Lady Amelia Heartwright, Colonel Andrews, Captain George East all are so ridiculous and entertaining. The actors all did an amazing job. I honestly have not laughed that hard in a film in a long time. I'm talking laugh out loud, bursting, crying, snort kind of laughing. Even my husband enjoyed himself and found many of the scenes very entertaining.I know I haven't talked much about the actual movie but bottom line: it's HILARIOUS. Go in with an open mind, allow yourself to be silly, let go of how ""unrealistic"" it is, and you'll be in for a treat.",positive
The Boxtrolls,"This visually impressive stop-motion animated movie plays like a twist on H.G. Wells' classic The Time Machine: its underground-dwelling Morlocks - here a diminutive race called Boxtrolls - are harmless critters with a penchant for steampunk, unjustly feared and discriminated by their smug Eloi - here the class-obsessed citizens of Cheesebridge. A boy adopted by the creatures, with the help of a surface girl, fights against ruthless town exterminator Snatcher, who plans to destroy the Boxtrolls.The vocal talent assembled here is impressive; as much as I like Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, Elle Fanning and Isaac Hempstead-Wright (Game of Thrones' Bran), the standout is an unrecognizable Ben Kingsley in a magnificently loathsome, scene-stealing turn as Snatcher.Much like the authors' previous work Coraline, this isn't for small children. It's not as creepy as their brilliant Gaiman adaptation, but it features a certain amount of grotesque moments - like a character's face horribly swollen after an allergic reaction - not really suited to toddlers.7/10",negative
The Boxtrolls,"The film Boxtrolls is so jam packed with themes that cut to the core of our society that you might expect it to be cobbled together, choppy, overreaching, and pretentious. It is, in fact, none of those things.A thoroughly entertaining, not too cerebral, romp down one box conveyor after another, the film succeeds at wrapping it's central theme of persecution and prejudice in layers of equally significant ideas: group self-identification, class ambition, dalliant obsessions, self-esteem, and self-destructive addiction. It follows a nicely predictable plot arc that will satisfy your children while you ponder whether the plucky heroine's ostensible obsession with the macabre is likely a reflection of a Freudian complex with roots in her father's indifference. The bad guy with his crooked teeth and greazy hair is unmistakably evil. But at the same time the good guys aren't wearing the white hats. In fact, it's comparing and poking fun at both incompetence and maliciousness.The animation finds it's grounding in a setting that is reminiscent of Corpse Bride. From the industrial green palate of the box trolls to the stiff and starched characterization of the patrician class, the visual design of the film holds together well.After the film you'll walk out of the theater with lots of things on your mind, but you won't be walking out with a child who was bored to sleep or fits by another didactic feature of animated hogwash. That is an impressive achievement for any film.",positive
21 & Over,"Watched ""21 and Over"" last night at an advanced screening so sharing a review for those wondering about it.If you should use other films/media to describe ""21 and Over"", it is like a combination of ""Hang Over"", ""American Pie"", and ""Jackass"". If describing in one sentence, ""21 and Over"" is stupid drunkenness or drunk galore? It is an enjoyable film and I would recommend it for those who enjoy dirty slapstick humor and just college craziness. I wouldn't feel the need to watch this film again and it isn't an Oscar nominee type of film, but If you like watching drunk people, this film is for you.I admit, I like watching this type of films from time to time, but a big reason I was interested in this film was because I liked the writers' Jon Lucas and Scott Moore's other pieces, the popular ""Hang Over"" film series and ""Change Up"". I did assume that ""21 and Over"" would be structured and directed just like ""Hang Over but ""21 and Over"" does not have the story-telling abilities that ""Hang Over"" has nor are the story, plot, resolution, and characters anywhere as interesting. One's own experiences and perspectives change with age, and Lucas and Moore are out of touch with the current 20s generation as the dialogue, story development, and characters in ""21 and Over"" are old, clichéd, and stereotypical.The movie took a while to pick up the pace. Surprisingly and thankfully Jeff Chang is not the main focus in this film, nothing against the actors (these newcomers did a great job), but the supposed main character burned through his drinking and bar scenes early on in a series of montages.Some of the likable aspects of this movie are the timing of the stunts and how outrageous the stunts are. When it seemed like the film would end soon or run out of tricks, the characters' rolling ball of chaos just got bigger and bigger. The stunts pulled now a day for slapstick humor are getting more outrageous and openly, visually sexual. If nothing, Lucas and Moore get kudos for fresh stunts. Perhaps they spent the time they were supposed to use for brainstorming dialogue and story development, watching ""Jackass"" instead.In the end this film is still enjoyable because it's not like this film's audience watches these kinds of films for the dialogue nor accurate representation of cultural identities. All that matters is that the slapstick stunts and moderate dirtiness of the film is enough to not leave a silent house. For sure, the high school kids during the advanced screening got a kick out of it, hoping their college life can be that fun? Crazy at least.Review by WendyXS@FeiXiangFilms",negative
21 & Over,The character of Miles is the most annoying person on the planet. Horribly acted by the actor who plays Jeff Chang. Nothing he says comes off as believable. The dialogue between Sarah Wright and the other male lead is horribly written.Not only is this movie not funny; it is a very predictable story line. Caution! you will see two of the male leads make-out.How people rate this movie above 5 is beyond me.They joke about incest in the beginning of the movie also. I would be embarrassed to even be associated with this movie. This is worst movie i've seen in a while.,positive
Fifty Shades of Black,"After weeks of being teased by the trailer I was so excited to see this film! I was expecting 50 Shades Of Grey meets Scary Movie- you know, a parody that actually worked. But I couldn't have been more wrong. It was more 50 Shades Of Shite. Five minutes in to the film and I knew i'd spend the remaining 1 hour 27 minutes with my palm on my forehead, cringing for my life at it's stupidity.The film had potential to be very funny but the idea was crushed by the terrible acting, and pathetic excuse for dark humor. I can account for the two times, throughout the whole movie, I let out a slight giggle- well it was more of a scoff but at least it triggered some kind of emotion eh. As a kid I loved the Haunted House and Marlon Wayans was brilliant in it; I think this is why I expected great things. I think he should stick to his PG rating films. It's crude sexual content contained stereotypical 'humor' that could be considered racist towards African American's and many people could take offence. I find it offensive that we are expected to pay as much as £5 to watch this. Watching paint dry is more entertaining. I was counting down the painful minutes, praying for the movie to end. When it did, sheer disappointment and disgust was how I was left feeling about this movie. This film is a waste of time and a waste of a cinema slot.",negative
Fifty Shades of Black,"Hard to believe Florence Henderson's and Jane Seymour would agree to be a part of this movie. It always bothers me when actors and actresses who, after having long and successful careers, lower themselves and take parts in awful films like this. The first thing I think is how disparate they must me to work again. Same thing goes for well-established actors who appear in commercials. If they totally blew all the money they earned during their careers, ok they need a job. But most haven't and are simply earning a nice fat paycheck from a sponsor. Florence Henderson died shortly after this movie came out and was the last film in which she appeared. Sad her last appearance was on such a low note. And I would think Jane Seymour would just be embarrassed.",positive
The Nut Job,"Before I begin berating this film, I would just like to preface that I would have considered it warranting of a 1 had it not been for the sufficing animation quality. This film is everything amiss about the cinema consolidated into one grotesque, insufferable mess. The pacing shows a stark lack of energy essential to this kind of film, which leaves the audience constantly expecting some kind of climax that the film never really manages to deliver, it's encumbered with purposeless characters and unexplained plot events (most notably a certain elderly character's antipathy for a dog whistle). In addition (as if everything previously mentioned weren't enough) the film has a completely incongruous scene in which the characters begin euphorically dancing to Gangnam Style, as well as a gimmicky, overdone dancing credits sequence involving the presence of a computer animated Psy for no explicable reason. Usually films tend to show a vestige of concern for subtlety when resorting to demographic pandering, though, this film just suffocates you with it.So, in short, unless you're searching for some ludovico technique material, avoid this film like the plague.",negative
The Nut Job,"This movie is pretty cool. It is funny and has a good amount of action. It is really good and I think you would like it too.This movie is all about a squirrel named Surly who, at the beginning, fends for himself and only himself (with his friend Buddy) until his actions contribute to the burning of the large tree where all the squirrels live, along with what little food they have left. He is banished to the city and soon finds a shop full of nuts. He makes a deal with another squirrel named Andie that he would get half and they would get half. They run into a lot of obstacles such as mouse traps, rats, guns and people.The main characters in the movie are Surly (Will Arnett), King (Stephen Lang), Grayson (Brendan Fraser), Raccoon (Liam Neeson), Andie (Katherine Heigl) and Precious (Maya Rudolph). My favorite character in this movie is Precious because she is such a funny dog and helps Surly and loves him after a while. She is also really funny.My favorite part in the movie is when Surly and Buddy meets Precious because, as I said she is my favorite character, and she is so funny. She thinks she has to hate the squirrels because her owners don't want animals in their shop but she soon realizes she loves them. She starts showing them tricks likes fetching, playing dead, sitting and she thinks that her tail is amazing because it wiggles a lot. She says it has a mind of its own! I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this movie for ages 4 to 10 because it is really suitable for a younger audience. I think younger kids will really love it.

Paddleton,When it works it really works a few genuine laugh out loud moments and a few perfectly sombre moments also. Overall though if I'm honest it did struggle to keep my attention and I did find the second half to drag a little despite two strong performances from the leads I just felt it needed a little more to actually be anything more than above average.,negative
Paddleton,"I had the privilege of watching the world premiere at Sundance. It's a poignant story of friendship between two men who have chosen to live a simple, uncomplicated life. At first I felt sad for these characters, who seemed to be just existing. But as the story moved along, what at first seemed mundane became a sense of comfortable routine. When faced with a terminal diagnosis for Michael, the pair embarks on a stoic journey through his final chapter. Along the way they reveal parts of themselves that were previously muted. Watching them maneuver the stages of grief, while knowing what the final outcome will be is heart wrenching. By the final scenes I was openly sobbing. The performances by Mark Duplass and Ray Romano pulled out a whole gamut of emotions. I found myself at various times laughing out loud, occasionally slightly uncomfortable, unendingly empathetic, and often sad. This is why I love movies, especially ones as beautifully made as this.",positive

The Bar,"A Spanish competition entry at Berlin, 2017, THE BAR, (El Bar) directed by Black comedy ace Alex de la Iglesia, is set completely in a bar in central Madrid then in the city sewers underneath. This is a black comedy -- at least it starts out that way -- but ends up as a most unfunny horror film with a prolonged nightmare coda in the shitty sewers of the city. At the outset two bar customers are strangely shot down leaving the bar and then their bodies disappear along with a pool of blood on the pavement just outside the entrance. The remaining customers within, including a very pretty young woman are freaked out and afraid to leave, especially when it turns out that there is some sort of deadly virus out there. This then becomes a nightmare something like Buñuel's ""Exterminating Angel"" as the people within become more and more animal like and start killing one another off, or trying to. The escape through the sewers reminded me of Wajda's Kanal but without any rhyme or reason. Pure bludgeoning of the senses. Little else. Mr. de la Iglesia made one of the funniest black comedies of all time, ""The Ferpect Crime"" (obviously imperfect) back in 2006. I was strongly looking forward to more of the same here in Berlin but stopped chuckling after the first ten minutes and was basically in agony for the rest of the picture. To be avoided like the plague and there actually is some kind of unidentified plague threatening the world in this suffocating appalling story.image3.jpegTrapped like rats in Alex de la Iglesias' Nightmare Madrid BAR",negative

The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"The first film was bright, pretty truthful about old age, and extremely watchable. This is a surprise sequel made because the first made so much money - and it shows. There is a lack of invention, very poor script, anodyne characterisation, and, worst of all, the plot line and meat of the film all belong to tele/film land rather than to real older people. You can see why middle aged, middle class film critics are praising it. There is little of the worries of old people (eg death, families left behind in UK, reflections on the past), India is a sanitised OK place (no hot climate, no crowds, no dirt) so they can go on expiating colonial guilt, no racism (such bad form and only for Mail readers), and the themes and tropes all belong to familiar cinematic conventions - eg infidelity, second marriage, unrequited love and no money worries! So the piece is really only held together by two of our greatest thespians - Maggie Smith and Judi Dench, while the subplots would disgrace 'Midsomer Murders!' What a wretched disappointment of a movie. This really does patronise the grey audience it is aimed at. Real life or any approximation of it is totally missing. While the Bollywood elements are just a tack on to meet the criticisms of the first film by those middle aged critics again - not enough representation of India, dahling! Oh really!",negative
The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"Have looked forward to this sequel and was not disappointed. It was so good to catch up with old friends (literally and metaphorically). Maybe the storyline was more diluted as less concentrated on the 'guests' and more on Sunni and his attempts to expand his empire and get married but the journey that the 'guests' had started was still ongoing. For me the film is a testament to the fact that old age need not be a slow descent into oblivion; we can lose interest before reaching the terminus or we can hang onto the strap handles and stick it out to the end, which is the message in the film and I know which I prefer. I have n't yet found my personal Best Exotic Marigold Hotel but when I do hopefully Dames Judi & Maggie,Bill, Celia, Ronald, Diana will be my fellow travellers, all haphazardly supervised by Sunni. To those expecting gratuitous violence, blood and gore, gritty reality and leave the cinema feeling life is on a downward spiral, then stay away. To those who want to enjoy a heart warming film,rekindle faith in human nature and joy and expectation in life, go see it and escape this miserable, violent world we live in; go with your friend/lover/partner or alone - just go and enjoy. I am in the age group that would qualify me as a guest but I, like them, am still on a wonderful journey, determined to strap-hang to the end.",positive
Calvary,"Calvary is the best current movie I've seen so far this year. It features an excellent performance from Brendan Gleeson as well as an involving, if off kilter, plot. The plot follows a priest who receives a death threat in the confessional and his struggle with how to respond, as well as with the foibles of his parishioners.The primary strength of the film is Brendan Gleeson's performance. I've been a fan of Gleeson since his performance in 28 Days Later, and this film gives him the opportunity to show his full potential as an actor. Kelly Reilly also does well as his daughter, while Aidan Gillen has a memorable turn as a cynical doctor.Calvary also benefits from good direction by John Michael McDonagh. Aside from keeping the story moving along, and adding a dash of humor in the first half, McDonagh leavens the film with beautiful footage of the Irish countryside. His only misstep is the inclusion is an unnecessary montage following the climax. However, this is too minor to merit real criticism.The film should be understood as an allegory, rather than a thriller, as its plot might initially suggest, or a realistic story. While Gleeson's character represents a decent man struggling with adversity and his own flaws, the various people he encounters represent various sins and occasionally virtues. For example, a corrupt financier represents greed, Gleeson's fellow priest represents complacency, etc. In many respects, the film is a modern version of a medieval allegory such as Everyman.Although it has strong Catholic themes, the pious should be warned that the film is very adult in its approach, something it makes clear with the first line of dialogue. Such content should not blind mature believers to the depth and sincerity of its religious message though. Indeed, now classic Catholic writer Graham Greene nearly found some of his books placed on the Index of Forbidden Books because of their adult content. Sometimes you must wade through the darkness in order to get to the light.",negative
Calvary,"My expectations for this movie were medium, I saw the cast had a lot of great comedians, so I thought there would at least be a few laughs. Instead, I was surprised to see a very powerful and touching movie, absolutely great script, never a doll moment, funny comebacks, terrifyingly creepy monologues and Brendan Gleeson. Hats off to this wonderful, talented actor! I was completely sold on his interpretation of an intellectual, yet devoted priest. And also, I found it very refreshing that the character was written as sincerely religious but not bigoted. I strongly recommend you go see this movie and I can't wait to see it again!",positive
The Cobbler,"after watching sandlers previous comedy ""blended"" i thought sandler has lost his touch forever.. i read the reviews n confirmed that i am sane . so yeah that was terrible. this time i thought sandler will again disappoint so i read the reviews (spoiler free of course) first and this movie had a lot of hate, loads of it and mostly by the critics. so i had my hopes at the minimum threshold. but after seeing this movie.. gotta say CRITICS Don't KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. this movie was funny, witty and acting was also great. i must say sandler has not lost his mojo . and hopefully never will. this movie is cool and thats the end of it. . a must watch if u ask me.",negative
The Cobbler,"I am glad I ignored the bad reviews from users and critics and watched this movie. I didn't have any expectations when I rented it, but was merely in the mood for a comedy that would take my mind off of a hectic day. Luckily, The Cobbler fit the bill. It was funny, charming, clever and overall very entertaining. The premise of the movie was unique and intriguing, and I enjoyed the plot twists and fantasy moments alike. Adam Sandler was in great form, and the entire supporting cast made the movie work like a well oiled machine (pun intended). I didn't find the characters played by Adam Sandler offensive or distasteful, and there were some real laugh out loud moments. Of course, there were plenty of moments full of genuine sentiment, with lots of lessons to be learned. This is the kind of movie I want in my permanent collection, and if there is going to be a sequel, I can't wait to see it.",positive
Unfinished Business,Honestly I don't know why this movie didn't get what it deserved. It's really hilarious and heartwarming.,negative
Unfinished Business,"I was drawn to Unfinished Business from the first trailer, and the negative reviews didn't do much for my confidence. However, I gave it a go and whilst its not great, its a lot better than the critics are making it out to be. I watched this on a plane, so it was heavily censored so I missed a lot of jokes. I think this cancels out the fact that I didn't have to see certain scenes that would probably have made me hate the film, so as far as I'm concerned its a tie.Vince Vaughn hasn't had a good 10 years, but he looks more alive here than he has in other rubbish. Dave Franco and Tom Wilkinson are quite funny as his dual sidekicks, even if they got a bit inconsistent sometimes or stale at others. Franco's bringing a box of personal belongings to a job interview ""to seem confident"" evoked genuine amusement in me. Sienna Miller plays a smug villain surprisingly well - the fact that I hated her is probably a good indicator that she's doing a good job. James Marsden also does a great job in key scenes. I imagine the largest complaint with this film is the lack of laughs, which is true and worth knocking off a few stars in and of itself. But I was pleasantly surprised with the family angle that Ken Scott took here, and whilst it was underdeveloped, it showed that there were some nice intentions here. The line that Vaughn's daughter writes at the end probably ended up being the nicest piece of writing in the entire film.So to conclude, Unfinished Business suffers on laughs and a conventional story, but there's enough good moments here to stop it being a total waste of time.",positive
The Lady in the Van,"Dame Maggie Smith and Alec Jennings are perfectly cast and directed in this amusing, moving portrayal of an irascible old lady's relationship with the timid writer who kindly offered her temporary refuge in his drive - but where she stayed for 15 years. It is a breathtakingly stunning performance from Smith and a brilliant performance by Jennings. The script is warm, insightful and witty, with the clever device of having two Alans - the writer who observes and the man who lives and interacts with the world outside. All the supporting cast are wonderful too. It's a must see movie, particularly for anyone who has cared for an elderly parent, or watched a parent care for their grandparent. Funny, moving and brilliant, it is a joy.",negative
The Lady in the Van,"The most notable features of Alan Bennett's writing are his honesty and wry, gentle humour. Despite some plot embellishments the authenticity of his ambivalence towards his mother and Miss Shepherd and the mixture of guilt, exasperation and pity which governed his relationships with these very different women, is beautifully conveyed. Maggie Smith's brilliance lies in her ability to suggest the mental illness which destroyed Margaret/Mary's life and still clouds her mind combined with her shrewd determination to survive while retaining some shreds of dignity and independence. She senses Alan's inability to turn her away and he, in turn, seems to recognise a sensitive, traumatised soul in the stinking, obstinate vagrant. Alex Jennings captures the essence of Alan Bennett, his fastidiousness, his high moral standards and his relentless pursuit of truth in his writing. The superb script and talented cast give a vivid portrayal of this period of the writer's life and the charm of his Camden neighborhood.",positive
Bad Words,"With a premise and character right in his wheelhouse, first time director and star Jason Bateman takes a script that could've been undermined by its clichés in the hands of a lesser talent and delivers an almost-winner with 'Bad Words'.On paper, Guy Trilby is one of the most unlikeable protagonists in recent film history, but Bateman is so skillful at these kinds of characters that you find yourself liking him despite your self. Talented co-star Kathryn Hahn provides a nice foil, and newcomer Rohan Chand is a dazzling breath of unpretentious fresh air as Guy's rival and eventual protégé.Though it never quite gels into something special, 'Bad Words' is a solid directorial debut for Bateman, and I look forward to seeing what he does next.",negative
Bad Words,"I was blown away by the surprisingly low ""6.7"" current rating on IMDb. My theory: The easily offended were easily offended (perhaps the movie should have been called ""Bad Words"").(Some of my favorite comedies: Dumb & Dumber, Super Troopers, and Tommy Boy).Jason Bateman stared in, and directed, this ""tightly"" constructed DARK adult comedy. There was not a wasted second or single ""slow"" moment in the entire 89 minutes.Everything was dead-on: The originality of the storyline, the casting, the acting, the timing, the tone, and THE KID!... I've never been a big fan of the ""cute, heart-strings-pulling, kid"" cliché, but you don't have to be to appreciate this kid - he takes NOTHING away from the dark humor, and only adds substantially to the film in every way. His authenticity and interaction with Bateman's character is as good as it gets (Roeper compared Bateman's spot-on apathy to Bill Murray's, and I couldn't agree more - you could just as easily picture Murray working his magic with the same degree of unflappability, esp. opposite such a contrastingly upbeat kid).Bateman is an unassuming Rock Star that let's his talents do the talking, and I'm looking forward to the next film he directs and leads.",positive
Zombeavers,"Zombeavers follows the story of five friends on a nice weekend out on the lake when suddenly malicious beavers come into the mix, that's where things start to turn horrific. I haven't enjoyed as much absurdity in film in such a long time. I mean by first glance of this poster, you're probably thinking ""This looks like such a dumb movie"" and my god, you don't even know how right you are. This was a pretty bizarre film but for some odd reason, I actually really enjoyed it. Don't worry this was a pretty stupid movie but I really came across to having a enjoyable time. For starters, the film did have a pretty commonplace plot that was pretty inevitable to see happen. The design for the Beavers were so laughable for the design in general and for the film that made them more appealing to see be played out but it was kinda silly to make them be puppets. One thing that I found absurd and uncanny was whenever someone got bit from one of the Beavers, they would start to turn into this human like beaver with a giant, claws and even the buck teeth, I was really a sight for sore eyes but it was pretty obscure and very bizarre. The acting was a minimal risk for this type of film but I guess you could say it was pretty fair with some of it was a bit exaggerated at some parts. My favorite portion out of the whole film would have to be the John Mayer and Bill Burr cameos, even though their characters were a bit foolish, they still managed to bring in some ample humor to their characters. I think the makers of this film really knew what they were getting their selves into and basically knew it was going to be a absurd film. Overall, this was mainly a stupid film with the stupidity being on point with this type of campy horror film but you can mainly get a kick out of it for the most part. Some of you may hate this film, some of you may appreciate and have fun with it like I did. Either way, give these Beavers a chance.",negative
Zombeavers,My friend and I were legit totes having a bad day until we found this movie... It looked pretty interesting so we thought we would give it a go. We have never seen something so well put together in our entire lives! This is officially the best movie I have ever seen. I laughed so hard and also cried. It was a mix of both scary and funny. It was so funny when the girl screamed on the hood of the car oh my gosh I cried. But it was a good cry. My friend screamed so loud. It was hysterical. I recommend this to the rest of my sorority sisters for when they are having a bad day and just need to laugh it out. Also this girl teaches you how to give 2 good slaps to a cheatin' ex-no-good-hot boyfriend.,positive
Toc Toc,"Whoever said this movie is horrible because it ""makes fun of people who suffer from OCD"" does not know the difference between comedy and insult. Of course , the pc police needs to learn outside tur US (it's a Spanish movie) people still enjoy a good laugh without being worried about which snowflake segment will be hurt.",negative
Toc Toc,As the majority of Spanish comedies it was a very light and life-like movie. You can sense the simplicity of the characters but that does not make the movie less valuable. It has a great message and I definetely saw myself in these characters.,positive
Sierra Burgess Is a Loser,"That is the real message of this movie. Absolutely terrible storyline, they want you to feel for the protagonist but in reality she's a terrible person.. seriously how is this trying to be spun in a positive light?",negative
Sierra Burgess Is a Loser,"After seeing 'To all the boys I loved before' I had a lot of hope for this movie. But, not even Noah Centineo can save it. The idea of the movie to show ""it's not about what's on the outside"" standpoint-but- the way they tried to prove it was just straight up weird. 
1) it was literally catfishing a guy to the fullest extent. They have a tv show for this specifically to show how gross and weird it is. Imagine going in to kiss a girl and *spoiler* her closing your eyes and then some other person you've never met before kisses you instead??? I would freak out but idk about you 
2) the only good part of this movie was seeing Veronica turn into a good person. Even though she helped carry on the weird catfishing, she turned into the nice girl that ended up saving the movie 
3) Jamey ended up taking her to the dance??? Like okay did she not just catfish you?? Like what if she was a 50 year old balding man, would you still have taken him to the dance?? Overall this movie was so weird and romanticized catfishing. Spoiler alert to life most catfishes are fat old men behind a screen in their moms basement and don't actually like you.",positive
Mr. Church,"""The wise son seeketh the father's instruction, but the scorner heareth not rebuke. I don't give a sh*t.""The quote above is, believe it or not, pronounced at a given moment by Mr. Church (Eddie Murphy) while he was drunk. Apparently alcohol has such an impact on him that he starts to use a vocabulary in such a way, an ordinary mortal can only guess the ultimate significance of what he's saying. This was also the first time I totally didn't understand what Eddie Murphy was talking about at that very moment (maybe it's due to my limited knowledge of English). In ""Mr. Church""you'll see a totally different Murphy at work. No smooth talking and witty one-liners. Don't expect to hear that catchy, infamous laugh from him. Not once it'll echo through the living room. Nope, here he puts himself in the shoes of a gentle, helpful and warmhearted cook who tries to accomplish a given task with conviction and empathy.This task was entrusted to him by Richard Cannon. He was once the lover of Marie Brody (Natascha McElhone) who left him after discovering that he was already married. However, he promised that he would always take care of her. Even after his death. If it turns out that Marie is terminally ill and only has six months to live, her daughter Charlie (Natalie Coughlin) discovers one morning there's a ""black man"" making breakfast in their kitchen. And from that day on Mr. Chruch conjures delicious dishes out of his culinary magic hat. So, you can expect a whole series of hunger-arousing images. It's almost similar to a Jamie Oliver TV show. Afterwards we come to know that Marie is still fighting her terminal illness after six years. Church's role as family cook slowly disappears into the background and over time he becomes the paterfamilias and acts as a father figure to Charlotte (Britt Robertson).Here, where I live, the remark after watching this movie would be ""Wow, what a lovely film this was!"". Granted, it's packed with cliché elements as used in any melodramatic coming of age film. The course is extremely predictable. Not much imagination is needed to realize that the roles will be reversed at any given time and how it's going to end. Both at the beginning and at the end they used the same text fragment ""Henry Joseph Church could have been anything he wanted. He chose to cook."". A subtle clue pointing at the cyclical nature of the film. But despite being a typical tearjerker, this film was able to captivate and fascinate me. Maybe because from time to time I need to watch a more positive film. Most films are about the evil side of a person. This film is about loyalty, affection, offering some help during hard times and the importance of family ties. You can start whining again about the possible racist tone and thus seeing Mr. Church as the happy, cheerful house negro who serves a white family. A kind of modern ""Uncle Tom"" in other words. It didn't feel like that for me. And I'm convinced you missed the essence of the story.But what's Mr.Church's big secret, anyway? He loves jazz. That's clear from the first moment. He's probably a jazz pianist. I noticed that he was pretending to play a piano on his knees while smoking a cigarette outside and listening to a jazz song in the background. He also mentioned it in a subtle way to Marie. And his visits to the nightclub Jelly (Charlie discovered this by accident when she was driving around the city with Poppy), a neon-lit bar you instantly have feelings about that it's a jazz club, seemed to me the appropriate place to find an audience for his talent. He paints, reads literature and uses secret ingredients while cooking. But are these really such big secrets that one should remain silent about it? Hearing what Mr. Church said when he came home drunk (""Yeah, that's right! I'm a sinner! Who's a fagot? You the goddamn fagot. ""), I have a feeling it's more about his sexual orientation. It stays a secret all the way. Nothing but praise for Eddie Murphy who attempts to get rid of his stand-up comedian label. And he succeeds perfectly. It's a pleasure to see him playing the two opposing Mr. Churches. On the one hand a dutiful and human figure. On the other a tormented person who still hasn't come to terms with his past. Also the acting of both Natascha McElhone as Britt Robertson can be called excellent. Especially the moments with Murphy and McElhone are sublime. Maybe it all feels a bit corny and old-fashioned. But it still remains a lovely film. More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",negative
Mr. Church,"I am so sad that this movie hasn't been advertised like other movies. I happen to find it on a whim. In this crazy world, this movie helps you remember that there are still good people who truly care, who are selfless. Eddie Murphy deserves an Oscar and so does the movie. I wasn't familiar with the young lady who acted with him. The character Charlotteshowed acceptance, love, hope and friendship. What a true friend really is and should be. This movie sees past racial lines and shows love. Best movie I have seen this year. It pulls at your heart strings. It is a must see.",positive
Strange Magic,"If you look at the statistics of IMDb votes, you will find that Strange Magic unfortunately falls into the category of ""either you love it or hate it"" - very few in-betweeners.From a graphical animation viewpoint it is superb, with well thought out details backed by a lot of hard work. For adult viewers who like animations (like me of course!) the plot, musicality and characters are significantly above the average animation, with a well-balanced socially and politically conscious theme.The immense flake it has got in the media and the ""hate it"" viewers are totally unwarranted. Its main problem is the strong disconnect between its actual adult theme and characterization, vs the way it is portrayed and marketed as a family animation - a sort of fairy tale mummy bring kiddies to - and you can see many of the complainers fall directly into this category.In other words, it 'looks like' animation for kids, but the plot and dialogue is totally way too adult.... which is exactly what keeps it interesting for me! Kudos to Mr Lucas for doing this - just too bad the real target market segment of ""adults who like fairy tale animation"" is just too small for it to make any commercial impact. But... thanks all the same!",negative
Strange Magic,"I absolutely love this film, but I'll admit it may not be everyone's cup of tea. Pretty much non-stop singing through the first half and some odd song placement can be a bit jarring to some people. Overall though, it's a very cute and BEAUTIFULLY animated film with some great humor, on point voice acting, and top notch singing. Off beat in the best of ways with very memorable characters that really make the movie. I LOOOOVE Bog King and Marianne and their interactions with each other. Just weird enough to be a cult classic, in my opinion. Definitely worth a shot, if you have an hour and a half to spare some day. You may just love it!",positive
Goon: Last of the Enforcers,I didn't go in watching this with high expectations but i did expect it to be good. Boy was I wrong. It seems every character from the first film lost major braincells and all act completely retarded going for cheap laughs. Potty humor at its worst. Every scene seems over the top outrageous and nothing seems genuine. The acting seemed very forced. My lady and I cringed at how horrible some scenes were and plot is incredibly predictable. The only good thing about this movie was the trailer. Even the fight scenes are overly dramatic this time around. Save your time and money. Don't be a victim like me.,negative
Goon: Last of the Enforcers,"Some will say that a sequel can never live up to the first film. Goon: Last Of The Enforcers begs to disagree. I was impressed with the writer's ability to squeeze another story out of Doug Glatt and the Highlanders. The story was very well done, and I enjoyed the fact that it managed to incorporate Liev Schreiber's character once again, in an enjoyable way that you may not be expecting. I enjoyed the inclusion of adult life, Doug having to balance hockey and an incoming child. The dramatic bits are very well done, and make you care for the character that much more. Jay Baruchel's direction is also top notch, especially from a first time filmmaker. The fight scenes are gripping and bone-crunching, as are the hockey games themselves. Paul Sarossy's cinematography is very versatile and impressive, making the hockey and fight scenes a joy to look at. Of course, there's the comedy. Seann William Scott is hilarious as lovable but dopey Doug Glatt. Jay Baruchel reprises his character from the first film and is just as hilarious as he was the first time around. The locker room antics of the team are also just as gut-busting as ever. This film is humorous, touching and moving, and is on par with the first in terms of quality. If you enjoyed the first Goon, then you'll love this one. I highly recommend this one. 9/10",positive
Unicorn Store,"Watching this film was a waste of time. Having to endure it's desperate attempts to poke into junior was torture and anticipating a plot was frustrating. The ending, was the rotten cherry on top to this garbage.It was like watching a children's fairy tale story desperately trying to tap into millenials.",negative
Unicorn Store,"I started watching this thinking it was more of a funny, bull crap fantasy concept, but found myself moved to tears by the end of it. Maybe it's just because I'm different, just like Kit, and I don't wanna grow up. Society feels like the depressing, gray and beige setting of her office - rigid and colourless. Individuals that stand out are pushed away instead of embraced. This movie might not be for everyone, and not everyone might get it, but for those of us feeling like we can't fit into the norm it really hits home.Brie Larson does an amazing job at both acting and directing, and Jackson is simply outstanding as the colourful salesman.",positive
Once Upon a Time in Venice,"The other reviewer gave a horrible score calling it ""average,"" but compared to all the other garbage coming out lately it is a gem. I can't remember the last movie that kept me wondering what's going to happen next. Also, being a surfer bum from S. Cali, the scenery and personas of the ""locals"" was nostalgic and spot on. If I wasn't laughing, I was at least grinning throughout the movie. Great casting with a surprising number of (old) A-listers throughout. A breath of fresh air from the &^$@ coming out of Hollywood these days.",negative
Once Upon a Time in Venice,I eventually turned this off. (hence the 1 out of 10) I gave it over an hour to actually captivate me but it failed so dramatically that I turned off in anger.This movie tries so hard and fails so hard. It tries hard to be funny and you end up feeling like you're watching a 5 year old making jokes. It tries too hard to be smart but it takes a smart person to make a smart script and not look like they're a Mr smartypants wannabee. This person is a Mr smartypants wannabee. It tries too hard to be sexy and just looks Chauvinistic.There was some potential here but completely lost.,positive
The Overnight,"What might be an average French film, makes a spectacular American tale about love and friendship, and the lines that blur them -- that abstract thing we all seek, which is human connection and understanding, in a place free from judgment. Any open-minded and free- thinking person, who has experienced a lot, or maybe not lived quite enough but yearns for something more, should enjoy the emotional awakening experienced among these four thinking and deeply feeling humans. This is at the same time a story about the comforts of stability and the drawl of temptation; it is a seduction more of the mind, than the body, that drives these characters. Don't be fooled, sex has very little to do with what any of these people really are after deep down inside. They are not so different from the rest of us.",negative
The Overnight,"Being a big fan of Tailor Schilling I really wanted to watch The Overnight, but four years after the movie's release I found it really hard to find a viewing platform. Unlike other Schilling appearances this was not on Netflix or Amazon. So in the end a friend gave me her copy to watch.
I thought this was a brilliant film, because it was so different from the mainstream blockbuster. With no big budget, ($200,000) and no famous actors it still gripped me from start to finish. I only recognised Schilling on the cast list but the other three actors were really good too.
I loved the intimacy of the location and short twelve hour timeline of the script which I felt made empathy with the characters more intense; the way the night gradually became stranger and darker really held me in an emotional spin to the end. Personally I made sure the first time I viewed The Overnight I had no previous siting of the trailer or reviews, and I would highly recommend this approach.
I didn't find the film offensive in any way. The pool scenes a bit daft maybe and the scenes at the end of the film although erotic due to great acting were not in the slightest pornographic and may have ended too soon.
Isn't it strange how in the Western world making films depicting graphic violence, huge body counts and attacks on women are taken as being quite normal and hardly worth a comment but introduce a little bit of sex and nudity causes many people (including reviewers of this film) to reach for the smelling salts. That is perverse.
Great film, highly recommended for the open minded amongst us.Graham UK.",positive
Philomena,"As several critics have observed, this wonderful film, just shown at TIFF, is destined to become this year's King's Speech (which began its Oscar run in Toronto too, though Philomena has already picked up accolades in Venice). Both British films have strongly emotional undercurrents leavened by wry humour, feature outstanding performances from the leads and are based on true stories.Judi Dench, as the Irish woman whose out-of-wedlock son is taken from her by Catholic nuns and sold to a rich American couple in the 1950's, has never been better. She imbues the role with a mix of wisdom (after all, as she reminds us repeatedly, she was nurse for 30 years) and naiveté that would seem to be impossible were it not so deftly handled. While the cynical atheist portrayed by Steve Coogan rarely misses an opportunity to poke fun at her, more often than not she enjoys the last laugh.Despite the consummate acting, and Frears' slick directing, the greatest treat of the film is Steve Coogan's screenplay. Given its subject matter, the story could easily have veered into melodrama, but just when it is on the verge of doing so Coogan pulls us back from the edge. Thankfully, Coogan himself is there to convey precisely the proper blend of sarcasm and compassion.",negative
Philomena,"My wife talked me into going, I wanted to see Captain Philips but she was adamant this time. We both grew up in Ireland and I didn't want to see another one of those movies focused on stereotypes, the marketing blob types like the Quiet Man and Ryan's Daughter...stereotypical nonsense that lampoon our history and our culture. Steve Coogan and Judy Dench, especially Judy got it just right from the very start. They were smart, witty, serious and most of all, Judy was 'Irish' They really got the spirit of an Irish mom, that cocktail of guilt, generosity, inferiority and a heart to care for the entire world spot on. Dench in the hotel thanking everybody for being 'so nice' and getting who her son was as a child as others were today trying to 'break the news' to her...she wasn't just a step ahead, she was years ahead. Really excellent, really well done. Beautiful!",positive
Magic in the Moonlight,"I kind of knew what I was getting into with a Woody Allen flick, but this movie was shockingly boring. I was actually startled by it. The actors totally phoned it in. Can't blame them, since the writing was so bad. After the King's Speech, not to mention Woody Allen's recent various exploits, I can only imagine that Colin Firth was offered an embarrassingly large pile of money to play this part. The central idea of the movie was shallow, lazily conceived and poorly explored. The dialogue meant to convey that idea was wooden and utterly unconvincing. These were some of the least engaging characters in a movie that I can think of. I absolutely did not care about them, what happened to them, or whether they would get together in the end. Just awful.",negative
Magic in the Moonlight,"I guess everyone of us had that moment in life when we realized that life isn't as magical as we had pictured it. That sometimes you can't talk yourself into believing something supernatural, something magical, but deep down you want to believe. What if you were finally convinced that there is more to the world than meets the eye? That is what happens to another at heart typical Woody Allen character Stanley, this time played by Colin Firth and he brings his English cynicism into the role. Known as debunker of myths and psychics he is enlisted by an friend to the French Riviera to prove a woman, that everyone is believing is a clairvoyant, to be fraud. As more time he spends with this woman Stanley starts to believe that she might be the real deal. and with that he is also turning into a nice person all of a sudden. Now that he's got something to believe in.Colin Firth is as usual cool as a cucumber but this he is actually likable and quite funny thanks to the always funny dialogue penned by Allen. Emma Stone is cute and funny as always. But what is real beautiful is the scenery of the French Riviera and the cinematography of Darius Khondji who has managed to capture the essence of Paris, Rome and now the south of France.The usual Wody Allen themes are quite prominent but still wrapped in this pleasant summer fare. Allen does get to tackle religion, belief, magic, the vast size of the universe and of course the unpredictability of love. Woody Allen is of the opinion that most of his films aren't perfect, that he never got to make the film he wanted. He has stated that only three of his films are as he envisioned them. In my opinion most of his films are perfect and flawless.",positive
Alex Strangelove,"The film seems hopeful during the first 10 minutes. After that the characters remain stagnant and one dimensional. Alex seems constantly alert and high strung (understandibly due to his dilemma), Clair is constantly disappointed, although it's hard to sympathise with her as her character doesn't evolve enough. Elliot character is unrealistic. The writers portray him initially as shy and mysterious, then he becomes extremely forward when trying to pursue alex, such behaviour is slightly intolerable.
he invites alex to a concert because ""Gretchen can't make it""he mysteriously appears at the same place as alex he offers to give alex a ride home he forcefully states ""you definitely need to come to my house"" when Alex doesn't know the song playing on the radio he summons alex to his bed knowing full well alex is in a relationshipand what erked me the most wad his sing along yo B-52s Dance this mess around. It was cringeworthy and just plain bizzare?? The movie finishes with, of course, the prom. Where Clair ""passes the torch"" (meaning passing Elliot to Alex) to show her support of their relationship, and is seemingly unaffected by what would likely be a devastating and heart breaking experience for anyone in the real world. Alex has one more hesitation prior to accepting his true self. Which means a quick run to the bathroom and hyperventilating. All hope seems lost when Elliot tries to leave right before.... Alex runs back and they embrace in a passionate kiss with everyone at prom speculating and being supportive. (I wish it were like that in the real world, unfortunately it's not)The only saving grace was the character of Dell who provided the main comic relief. However, some of his comments to Alex were slightly offensive and homophobic. The kids are great actors I'm sure, the script may have let them down.",negative
Alex Strangelove,"I just wanted to watch another stupid movie to keep myself distracted. I had no idea that this movie would touch me so deeply.

I Give It a Year,"I Give It a YearI really wanted to like this film but as I watched I became more and more irritated by it. Dan Mazer tried far too hard to deliver what I'm sure he thought were amusing British comedy one liners but it was overdone, lacked originality and was frankly boring. Any acting skill was dwarfed by poor overburdened script writing which made authenticity difficult to execute.The scenes, characters, story line and plot have all been done far better in other British classics like Notting Hill and Four Weddings where everything gels beautifully. Here however is a mish-mash of nonsense that fails to deliver. I was tempted to switch off 10 minutes through but thought I may as well give it a shot. What a disappointment!This movie demonstrates a new non-comic genre of British film making which is too overdone to be funny, too unrealistic to be engaging and too irritating to be entertaining. I give it the thumbs down",negative
I Give It a Year,"This movie is a great laugh, sure it's not the Godfather but Rafe Spall and Rose Byrne are brilliant. Minnie Driver is so funny",positive
A Haunted House,"No, really. A Haunted House is basically another one of those unnecessary horror comedies that aims to make fun of the popularity of the first Paranormal Activity and The Devil Inside, which were done by making the movie look like found footage. With this film, I think it should have been rated NC-17 with its overload of sex scenes, as it has so many, it gets old real fast. Also, the film contains the usual toilet humor (which by now, is overkill), and even relies on using other bad jokes that sound like they were thrown in there to get some cheap laughs, as they are horribly written. This is a complete wastes of the talents of those involved (especially Cedrid The Entertainer) and I do not recommend this unless you are one of those people who find such content enjoyable.",negative
A Haunted House,"I loved this movie, I could go back to see it again. I laughed so hard. The comedy was refreshing, It's been a while since I can recall a movie that left me laughing like this movie did. It was a change from most recent movies based on drama (killings, kidnapping and etc...). I would tell anyone who likes to laugh this is the movie to see. It was nice to see Marlon Wayans independent from his family. I loved each and every character, Marlon Wayans, Essence Atkins and Cedric The Entertainer were fantastic in the movie, but if I have a favorite it would have to be ""Chip the Psychic"". Just sitting here writing this is making me laugh and think about the movie. Don't just take my word for it GO SEE IT!",positive
Brad's Status,"Poor Ben Stiller, he's not as rich as his friends. Boohoo he's not sleeping with 20somethings. Yawn-inducing middle class, middle-aged angst. Terrible.",negative
Brad's Status,"I hadn't seen a Ben Stiller movie in a while and this one kind of came out of nowhere. Very little marketing and promotion meant that when I saw it was released I was surprised, but it is reflected in its low budget. The movie follows Brad (Ben Stiller) who is disappointed with his life, since all of his friends became very rich and successful in life. The plot revolves around him going to Harvard with his son, who is trying to get into the university. The rest of the plot if filled in with learning more about Brad and his successful friends, whilst his son is really only there to move the main plot forward. It all felt a bit slow, which was not helped by the sweeping camera shots with no speaking and Brad's narration that is a bit too frequent. However, when things eventually happen in the plot it is good. It made me feel sad for Brad at times, yet happy when he realised what was truly important in life. The key message, of course, is that money does not equate to success and this movie certainly delivers that well. What I also enjoyed was that although this message has been littered in numerous movies, Brad's Status delivers it in a refreshing format.Although Brad's Status will not wow you, it is certainly a good movie. The plot is nothing new and it may feel slow at times, but it will bring a smile to your face in the end. Regardless of whether you like Ben Stiller's previous performances or not, this will be a worthy addition to your watchlist, especially at this time of year when it can be chilly!",positive
A Hologram for the King,"Being a Saudi woman studying in the US, I was prepared for a movie full of stereotypes that I usually encounter in my daily life. However, it was even worse than my imaginations! Aside from the exaggerations and lies, there was no plot. I couldn't tell what the purpose of the movie wasAlso, the Arabic language spoken wasn't even close to the Saudi accent! And mentioning things like it's rare to have Saudi female doctors, seriously?!!!!It was a waste of time watching a poorly researched and written movie.Tom Hanks' acting didn't live up to the expectations either.",negative
A Hologram for the King,"A good film about being 60, being alone, being abroad and being open-minded.Tom Hanks is a troubled man sent to KSA to sell something on behalf of a big American Corporate. And there he clashes with Arabic Culture in his usual thoughtful and suspended-judgment way.I won't tell you what happens, of course, but after a quick look to the other reviews (someone even claims to have fallen asleep) I understood that not everyone have liked it. And I'm surprised but I won't comment. I would just say, for those who could possibly share my feelings, that this was a good film: interesting, clever and not slow at all. Just, maybe, a little different. Images are great and the story depicts nicely our difficult times. Besides: is there a such thing as a bad Tom Hanks' film?",positive
He Never Died,Netflix is a crazy breed but they nailed this movie. Rollins has always in every way paved the way for all. If you don't know Henry Rollins then please explore.,negative
He Never Died,"Wife and I were cruising NetFlix for a B-Movie to watch and ended up turning on this sleeper. I mean sleeper in a good way.Honest, if you like a movie that mixes up comedy, horror and drama with an expert casting of characters, you need to watch this one.The casting of Henry Rollins is only second to his performance. With perfect timing, Henry delivers line after line without breaking character even to blink. He just went up several notches in my ""fav""actor category because of this movie.Add to it a well picked supporting cast, well thought out the script, great pacing and just the right touch of effects, we have a winner that should have been in the theaters. Honest, it could have been well received by a mature audience looking for something with more than just empty violence and snarky comebacks.Want something to watch that will make you think, wonder, then nod when the reveal comes up? Watch this movie. It will not disappoint.",positive
Please Stand By,The movie seems good. It's a classic story where the main character is autistic and struggles through life. The character presentation has been done excellent. Cast fits the characters perfectly. Dakota Fanning does an excellent job portraying an autistic woman in a young age. A feel good movie to watch and enjoy in free time.,negative
Please Stand By,"A very nice take on an autistic person life, dreams, difficulties. I watched with pleasure and every scene was so convincing. I simply cannot understand why this movie does not have higher scores. The Star Trek stuff was cleverly inserted into context and as a fan of science and space fiction that could not be better. Go watch it, if, as a Vulcan, you don't mind shedding some tears!",positive
Handsome Devil,"Quite an illustrative tale of conforming, this film. It is gay themed, but could equally apply to anyone new to an environment and who struggles to fit in. Here, two classmates who share a room form an unlikely bond; one a star sportsman and the other a bit of a pariah. It has two redeeming features of note - the use of sport as a positive conduit, albeit via a pretty circuitous route; and by allowing initially hostile characters to reprioritise their beliefs and accept a relationship that would otherwise attract their derision (as, indeed, it does initially). Fionn O'Shea and Nicholas Galitzine - with a bit of help from their teacher Andrew Scott - contribute well, with a strong, plausible, script to make for a decent drama.",negative
Handsome Devil,"I picked this off Netflix on a boring Saturday afternoon. Boy I wish I had seen it sooner.I was totally shocked at how good it is - the story line is something we can all relate to - a world that often isolates those who don't ""fit in"".Fionn (Ned) and Nicholas (Connor) are absolutely relatable in their roles, and I loved the cameo by the English Teacher. While some may critique the ending as ""predictable"", but IMO any other type ending would destroy this movie. After the emotional roller-coaster of the film, we NEEDED that ending. Thoroughly recommend it for all - especially for those who think that anyone who is different is a lesser individual.",positive
The Young Offenders,"Having watched the TV Series first and fallen in love with Conor and Jock's escapades, I finally got around to watching the film. While it is still still fun, outrageous and cringeworthy (in a good way), the film isn't as good as the series. The characters feel slightly more 2 dimensional . If I had seen the film first, I doubt I would have wanted to watch the TV series.
It's still an OK film and a good length, at less than 90 minutes and you can see the green shoots of what the TV show was to become.",negative
The Young Offenders,"Being from Cork myself, this film ticks all the boxes. There was a lot of talk about it, so going into see it I was feeling it might fall short, as normally films this hyped turn out shite. From the moment this film starts it is just so funny right till the end. I'm not sure will many people outside of Ireland get the humor, but this is one of the funniest films I've seen in a very long time, as I can relate the two lads to so many people I grew up with and PJ Gallagher was brilliant as the crippled dealer. Some brilliant characters in it and every joke was right on the money. I really do hope we get a sequel!",positive
Barely Lethal,"Desperate to experience the 'normal' adolescence of teen movies such as 'Bring It On' and 'Clueless', a teenage assassin flees the institution that trained her and enrolls in a local high school in this action comedy starring Hailee Steinfeld of 'True Grit' fame. The premise is ripe with potential and the film gets one of its best lines early on as Steinfeld tells a group of genuinely friendly cheerleaders ""I've seen 'Mean Girls'... twice!"", however, not enough is made from the notion of Steinfeld navigating her way through the high school experience based on movie clichés. Most perplexingly, she fails to pick up on the 'love is closer than you think' cliché with Thomas Mann doing the best he can in a thankless turn as the kind-hearted tech geek who has to wait the whole movie before Steinfeld realises that she wants him. The film also never quite maximises the potential of all her assassin training with the bits where she inadvertently hurts others few and far between. The fake slang that the teenagers use in the film is incredibly irksome too. There is a great running gag though with young Jason Drucker constantly finding weapons and gadgetry that Steinfeld has stashed. There is also a very funny bit in which Steinfeld and a friend discuss killing just like two normal teens discussing sex; ""the first time should be special""! As for Steinfeld herself, she is engaging throughout. The best performance though comes from Rob Huebel channeling Eugene Levy in 'American Pie' as Mann's wannabe hip father who keeps trying to discuss girls with him in detail.",negative
Barely Lethal,"Candy coated, sure, but not without poignancy. Above-par acting and a great cast elevate this slightly formulaic farce. Close your cold hard eye and have fun with this one. Some laugh-out-loud moments and great fight choreography. Hope to see the talented lead actress in more films.",positive
Laggies,"We are talking a script that is not merely bad, but bad on a level of magnitude which makes other bad scripts look like Oscar material.There are too many examples to list here. But let us just say that the scene where Sam Rockwell suddenly and out of nowhere declares his love for Knightly -- after barely getting to know her from a few conversations while she is staying over with his teenage daughter, a declaration of love uttered while he is acting as her lawyer in a police station trying to deal with drunk driving charges -- rings as true as a statement from the Federal Reserve as to why the problems in the economy are not THEIR fault.Once you factor in the bad script, you realize it becomes hard if not impossible for any of the actors to rise to the occasion. It is like hobbling a race horse and then expecting it to show or place.That said, Knightly tries but never, not once, connects with her character. CSM rides to the finish on charm alone and I believe one day the right role will arrive for her and she will go A-List. Rockwell puts in the closest thing to a credible performance.And the turtle unburdened by dialog also does a nice job,",negative
Laggies,There is a winning quality to this romantic comedy about a girl in her 20s (Knightley) in a bit of a mid 20s crisis after being proposed to by her boyfriend. She befriends a teenage girl (Moretz) and her divorced father (Rockwell). It starts off a bit slow but then you realize gradually the characters are all quite likable even when they are doing something wrong. This understated treatment of the more serious moments makes it more effective especially the visit to the mother (Mol). Avoids melodrama which would have spoilt the tone of the movie.Keira Knightley makes her 20s finding herself girl surprisingly sympathetic and identifiable. Throughout her mistakes you still root for her. Chloe Grace Moretz is a standout as always. She gives a sensitive performance and doesn't overact. Amidst all the recent movies a likable teenager character on film is kind of rare. Sam Rockwell plays the father quite charmingly.Overall one the better indie rom coms of late and worth a watch.,positive
Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip,"I loved this movie. Let me tell you personally, it is a thousand times better than Star Wars: TFA. Of course, TFA is a great movie; however it does not live up to the standards set by this masterpiece of a movie.Brilliant story, brilliant performance, brilliant music.If I could score this an 11/10, I would very happily do so.Take a chance and see this movie, don't listen to the other reviews.No spoilers from me because this is a story you wont want to have spoil-ed, trust me on this.Great movie.10/10",negative
Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip,"Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip cast includes;Jason Lee as David ""Dave"" Seville, Tony Hale as Agent James Suggs, Kimberly Williams-Paisley as Samantha, Josh Green as Miles, Bella Thorne as Ashley Grey, Laura Marano (cameo) as Hotel Babysitter.All of whom add their own unique flavor to the bubbling stew that is the movie Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip. The work these actors and actresses put int to this pile of cinematic awesomeness brings an old, stale, peace of nostalgia back to life for a new generation to enjoy. Not only does it keep an old 80s bit of history alive but, it helps build bridges between children and their parents as they can share a part of their childhood with each other that will last a life time.This movie is a 10/10 because I Hate Everything. Now you know or you don't",positive
They Came Together,"I am a huge fan of comedy and satire and I'm even okay with the occasional absence of plot for the sake of laughs... Cheap laughs. The type of film that may be void of intellect but still provides entertainment and gets me laughing. But this movie has foregone the plot for the sake of nothing. The comedy found here isn't even good enough to be labeled juvenile or sophomoric. It is down-right stupid. I was not entertained. I was disappointed. Especially since several of the cast members are people whose movies and shows I have enjoyed on numerous occasions. I thought I might find something comparable in this film. Boy, was I wrong. In fact, I hated seeing these people in such a low-level production. The writing is horrid, and yes, that is taking into account the fact that it is ""supposed to be cheesy"" as the movie's intro explains. It just failed to do so in a way that worked and so it fell flat. Very, very flat. I do not recommend this film.",negative
They Came Together,"They Came Together is the first great film satire in years. It skewers everyone, from the most renowned romantic comedies to the most idiotic chick flicks. Paul Rudd and Amy Poehler are perfect, parodying the roles they could very conceivably be cast in (and I believe Paul Rudd has done a few times). Not every joke lands, and most of them go by so quickly it could all be a 30 Rock cutaway, but nevertheless this movie is a delight for anyone who has noticed how brainless and predictable most romantic comedies end up being. Cheers to everyone involved in this movie, and to everyone who gets the joke. Watch it; I hope you find yourself laughing as hard as I did (all three times I watched it).",positive
Love & Friendship,"I can't agree with the enthusiastic reviews of this film nor wholly agree with those that absolutely hate it. Put me right in the middle. The film captured my attention well enough but was ultimately unsatisfying.First of all, Chloe Sevigny seems out of place and while supplying the ""Friendship"" part of the title, has little to do except be a sounding board for Lady Susan. And Stephen Fry is WOEFULLY underutilized.Second of all, watching the film through the Austen lens will be disappointing (perhaps the Stillman lens works better). There are certainly funny bits (James Fleet reading a letter, Tom Bennett's idiocy, and Lady Susan's clever rationales for abhorrent behavior) but these are Stillman funny not Austen funny. And a Brit who doesn't know what peas are!? Yes, the scene is definitely hilarious but nonsensical.Finally, it's a superficial film. Even the poorest adaptations of Austen's significant works can't help but have some gravitas simply due to the ideas present in the novels. The source material here is weak (and Stillman doesn't seem to have added much heft to it). Having read the novella, I can assure you that, while having some clever lines, it is not too memorable. And the film, like the novella, presents few ideas about ""Love"" or ""Friendship."" (In addition, it's an epistolary novella which might explain why so much of the action seems to be reported rather than viewed.)The cast (with the exception of Sevigny) is charming and the film is well-acted. Beckinsale deserves the accolades she is receiving for her performance but ultimately deserves a better film in which to display her talents.",negative
Love & Friendship,"This is one of the few films I have seen where I was left wanting more. There were non stop laughs, funny sight gags and wonderful actors. It was wonderful to see Kate Beckinsale and Chloe Sevigny back together as well. Tom Bennett is truly a joy to watch and steals all of the scenes he is in. The costumes, sets, and acting are all top rate. The script, pacing and direction all make the movie flow at a fast pace. I was never bored and at the end of the film, I was left wanting more. This is one of the greatest compliments I can give to a film. Time does fly when you watch this film and feel free to laugh out loud when you watch it. Everyone else will be.Ten out of ten",positive
Cooties,"I can honestly say I hated 'Cooties'' within the first five minutes.When you make a horror/comedy, and the comedy falls flat on every level, you're in for a very long 90 minutes. I can imagine people walking out of this one around the 15 minute mark, because that's when my limit of stupidity had reach it's maximum capacity. There just isn't enough horror to make up for the rest of the film. The acting is some of the worst I've seen all year. Maybe the worst. Alison Pill and Jack McBrayer are worthy of a Razzie nomination, at the very least. They give hands down the worst performances you're going to see in any film this year. Elijah Wood is terribly miscast, as he's inserted into a role that would be best played by Adam Sandler. That's right, Elijah Wood, you get a pass on this one. Words cannot describe how bad the dialogue is, so I won't even try. You'll just have to experience it for yourself. My apologies.The best way to describe this awful film, is that it's something you'd expect from Adam Sandler - and I'm curious how and why he missed the boat here. Maybe he was busy with 'Pixels?' I am just baffled how a film this bad can get any type of positive feedback, as it is complete and utter trash. Do yourself a favor and check out 'Bloodsucking Bastards' instead. Random Ramblings of a Madman: Out of all my reviews, this is the only review where I'm curious to see how many down votes I receive. Because it tells me that somewhere out there is a person or persons who actually enjoyed 'Cooties.' And that will be funnier than anything I experienced in the film itself. Thank you.",negative
Cooties,"Clint (Elijah Wood) goes to his old school, Fort Chicken elementary school, Illinois (GO FIGHTING ROOSTERS!) as a substitute teacher. He meets Lucy (Alison Pill) an old friend who has trouble with normal conversations. Her boyfriend is the PE teacher Wade (Rainn Wilson) who owns a truck with duo rear wheels. The film introduces us to a number of quirky characters and kids that are not that adorable. Due to a viral breakout caused by processed chicken nuggets (I tossed mine out after seeing how nuggets are made from pink paste) the children turn into blood thirsty zombies who attack in hordes with some limited mental capacities.The film spoofs formula writing: dress up montage; guy who is way too smart; self-sacrifice individual; climbing through the vent duct; and a reference to a previous film...""Sneak around like a little Hobbit.""This is a funny zombie style cult film.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",positive
The Grand Seduction,"As the title suggests the movie might seduce you. It might sort of trick you into liking it. Why trick you? Because you could easily depict the movie and the story it tries to tell you. It would be very easy in fact. But it's not only the actors (Brendan Gleeson heading the group as ""leader""), but also the way the story is portrayed.You will know where this is going, so if you don't like predictable movies, you might want to stay away from this. But you'd be missing on a feel good movie, that really has a lot of heart. Taylor Kitsch might have done some movies that weren't successful and you might not think of him much, but he's doing a good job in this. He's convincing and carries the movie with the others through the finish line ... or whatever equivalent there is in the game he likes ...",negative
The Grand Seduction,"This film is brilliant. If you're tired of the same old fare that the American Comedy giants make then see a movie that doesn't resort to shock value or follow the one-up trend. See a movie with heart and substance that has a point and makes you feel good about the world. In ""The Grand Seduction"", The jokes range from brilliantly subtle to absurdly silly and are designed to poke fun at everyday life in a small coastal town. It really is a shame that this film wasn't given more of a chance in theatres, and it's shocking that people can find something bad to say about it. I, however found this film refreshing and I hope more Canadian style comedies are made, even if they need to be stolen from the French Canadians!",positive
Hector and the Search for Happiness,"I'm not sure which movie the other people on this review board have been watching, because when I went to see this (in Canada), even total strangers were compelled to connect afterwards about how painful it was, while leaving the cinema to meet their other friends who had walked out earlier.. I normally love Simon Pegg, love what you might call ""existential"" or ""whimsical"" stories such as Amelie, Walter Mitty, About Schmidt, anything along that broad spectrum between Love Actually and Ingmar Bergman. But, THIS..Paradoxically, one of the life-rules it thrusts down your gullet with all the subtlety of feeding a foie gras goose, is that you should be true to yourself, and genuine....exactly like this movie isn't.It's told from a distinctly lazy, privileged, patronising and comfortable point of view, and even offensively stereotypical and superficial about non-western cultures:In China it's all big dinners and sleazy old white dudes with high-class Asian hookers and migrant workers everywhere..Africa is all about dangerous and primitive conditions with a few casual lines of dialogue thrown in about how foreign aid doesn't get to the people who need it.Simon Pegg, after being pistol-whipped repeatedly in the face, defecating in a bucket and left to rot by kidnappers, then being dumped by the roadside and narrowly escaping death...is miraculously and instantly in the mood to party. Cue: Reams of colourfully dressed Africans, apparently with nothing better to do than to than dance around as if straight out of a Kenyan tourist board commercial, make everything OK again in, like, two minutes flat. Any human would be traumatised and need recovery in hospital after that ordeal but there is no time to be authentic in this movie, we've got synthetic emotions to ooze and platitudes to preach. ""The audience won't notice..""Oh, and then there is a revelation of an interracial gay couple, which is meant to be poignant and meaningful, except we really don't know these guys and therefore don't care whatsoever. It's as if the filmmakers assume that the audience are brain dead peasants who have been locked in a room their whole lives: ""Gay interracial couples exist folks, it's true"" Wow...really?Sometimes a bad movie is just a bad movie for whatever reasons and that is a shame, but what really got me so incensed with this was the flippant way it dealt with huge important concepts such as: Happiness, relationships, race, sexuality, culture etc.etc.It's like a casual holiday travelogue with a thin veneer of paint on top, promising: ""If you, as a human, sometimes think about your place in the universe and what happiness is, then you will want to watch this and be rewarded by learning a thing or two."" To which I responded: ""Great, here's my $15, can't wait!"" But underneath the paint there is just...more paint. Maybe, just maybe, they could make fortune cookies with the messages in this movie, that might fit the maturity level of the wisdom it literally RAMS down your throat.And don't get me started on the jolly Tibetan Monks...the Dalai Lama would cringe.",negative
Hector and the Search for Happiness,"This is for the first time I am writing a review for a movie despite the fact that i have been a big time movie buff for 20 years.

Most.... but not all,,, for some people are so inured into the vagaries of life that they might lose patience with a somewhat slow pace of the movie. Well, losers....have patience...it will pay. If you are someone who values time....YOUR TIME...ON THIS PLANET...you've gotta watch this.

Its not a true story or a documentary, just a wicked good time.
All performances were spot on
And, Katherine Heigl is not hard on the eyes.
8.5 rounded up to 9",negative
Home Sweet Hell,"Home Sweet Hell is basically a dark comedy.It's not a comedy per se because it has jokes or funny situations. It's comed-ish because of the very efficient performances of the 2 leads, Heigl and Wilson. That's what makes this movie tick in my opinion. The performances are exaggerated but they never become ridiculous. Even some weird and cartoon-ish grimaces delivered form Wilson.The music helps the movie a lot. It gives the proper tone especially when the movie take its dark turn.The direction is OK I guess but nothing to write home about it.The plot soon becomes evident, but there are some twists even after the final credits start to roll.Jim (not James!) Belushi is here too. Gives a professional performance in a rather small part.Overall: A low budget violent dark comedy that will keep you entertain because of the performances and the chemistry of the 2 leads. Good but nothing spectacular.",positive
What We Did on Our Holiday,"What makes this movie a hoot? Three adorable children who comprehend the world with their own little brains, see relationships with their own beady innocent eyes, and act on their reckless instincts and innocent unbloomed knowledge. What We Did on Our Holiday is a delightful perspective into the abyss of the broken that skims its aftermath gorgeously.David Tennant looks the right kind of perplexed in the comedy trying to figure out his children and marriage whilst Rosamund Pike complements him beautifully with her engaged acting. Ben Miller as Gavin is brilliant as well. Billy Connolly ices the funny storyline with his pizazz and brilliant comic timing.The screenplay is witty, subtle and snappy. The good thing about its humour is that the entire film, unlike other comedies, is not build on a slapstick foundation. The theme of the movie sometimes goes really thoughtful from sheer comedy which further furbishes the rhythm. The plot will make you giggle per se without any extra addition to the story.If you look at the downsides, sometimes you do hope the drama to be a little bit more grave. It lacks profundity, but considering it a Comedy, this fact can be overlooked.A brilliant comedy that is compelled to traverse the 'outstanding category' by the mere cuteness rush of Harriet Turnbull and Bobby Smalldridge. This Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin project is a definite go go!",negative
What We Did on Our Holiday,"Absolutely loved this film. I laughed, I smiled and I cried. The script is quirky and wonderfully imaginative. In an hour and a half 'What we did on our Holiday' manages to dissect family life and reconstruct it to embrace every aspect of the complete gamut of the generations and their interactions. And it does so with both sympathy and hilarity. Of all films ever, it's the one that has made me feel best about being human. Flawed is fine in each and every generation, but the beginnings and endings are infinitely easier than the muddle in the middle. The acting throughout is exceptional but the child actors deserve a sky-fall of medals. Great stuff!",positive

Everyone involved in the making of this movie has raised d bar so high low minded individuals will low ball this merely because they share opaque mindsets N don't understand!!!!!

Frank,"I don't actually have any way to start about this. The cinematography, the acting, the jokes (or lack there of) and the overall feeling are done quite well. The problem is, I didn't hear a chord of music worth listening or a verse that made any sense whatsoever. Then I realized that the movie is not about music at all, and that the whole thing serves as some kind of therapy, after you see that the keyboard player wanted to commit suicide, and a whole lot other crap happening with the members of the band. The first part of the movie looked like a mock to all the nowadays music and the musicians, showing the lack of talent and the ignorance in all of it. Afterwards, you realize that they're all mental patients and that it's not about the music at all. Now, after we digested this fact alone, what is left is still not satisfying or artistic. It might as well been a story about autistic children making charity gifts. There is nothing there to look at, honestly. As much as I wanted to have something learned and felt from the film, I only actually felt sorry for the characters, which is well not worth the money or the time. Sorry, Fassbender, this is a low for you.",negative
Frank,"I happened to see the trailer for a movie I had never heard of, called Frank, at 8:45AM this Saturday morning. Within five minutes of seeing the preview, I found that the Angelika Theater at Mockingbird Station was the only place in Dallas showing this wonderfully bizarre looking movie, and by 10:20AM, I was sitting in a dark room with about twelve other people, waiting to see just what this giant paper-mache head had in store for us.Maybe I should step back to explain that last part. Frank revolves around an avant-garde musician names Frank, who is never seen without an oversized paper-mache mask on. The trailer promised quirky indie escapism, possibly some decent music, and some references to SXSW – ahhh, there is such beauty in under-promising and over-delivering.For a brief moment, it feels like Frank will be little more than a stylized fictional Behind The Music type of movie because the central narrative is observed and reported from the viewpoint of an involved outsider, the new guy in the band. The outsider point of view is a perfect choice, however, because the audience then has the same questions as the narrator so we're all in it together. Is the end product of music/art as important as the process of creating it or who you create it with? Frank captures the ambition and compulsion of creating art and very harshly slaps away any generalizations of how or why an artist is the way he is. The paper- mache head isn't a gimmick for the movie or the music.On the topic of music, Frank and his band The Soronprfbs, are easily ranked in the top five fictional bands – The Wonders(That Thing You Do), Stillwater(Almost Famous), Eddie & The Cruisers(Eddie & The Crusiers), Wylde Ratttz(Velvet Goldmine), and The Soronprfbs(Frank). The music falls somewhere between The Flaming Lips, Jim Morrison, and an extremely catchy coffee shop rambler.The band is absolutely mesmerizing every single second they are on the screen and much of that credit has to go to Michael Fassbender. Because we can't see his face, every bit of emotion must be poured out elsewhere. Fassbender delivers an extremely physical performance. From the combination of his hands and voice, to the way he shuffles when uncomfortable, to the way he loses control when he sings, the small crowd that happens to see Frank this year will be seeing one of the best performances of 2014.It has been almost two days since I saw Frank and I still can't get it out of my mind. Maybe it's the music or maybe it's the acting but I think the bigger reason is that it asks the questions I thought only I had. How does someone create something both abstract and powerful? What part of my brain should I be tapping into? Why can't I? Frank is a photograph of the special brand of artistic jealousy that wants to be or at least be part of something bigger and better than ourselves, all while realizing the privilege of simply getting to be witness to that greatness.",positive
She's Funny That Way,"Within 10 minutes it becomes apparent that this is a sub-Woody Allen heavily referenced 1930s screwball influenced - copied - movie.As the product of a young man's devotion to that era and genre it might stand up, and, if interpreted to contemporary styling, be of some merit. That this is the work from a veteran is really quite sad.It is boring, tedious, wordy and obvious with its various types, its psycho-farce plotting, which hinges on a comically exaggerated accented Poots doing her schtick as she explains the entire story.This ought to be classified as a home movie and so only the team that made it should made to suffer it, say at Thanksgiving or Christmas. Then, they can snooze while it plays and utter platitudes to grandpa for making this pastiche of an old memory from his younger days.",negative
She's Funny That Way,"I loved this movie. It had definitely had a Woody Allen feel to it. The opening with the music of the 1930's... the neurotic characters getting entangled in ever more complex situations leading to many laughs... Others have compared the movie to ""screwball comedies of old"". Either way, it really works. A great cast of actors doing excellent comedy. Even Jennifer Aniston made me laugh quite a few times! Imogen Poots was amazing! Perfect comedy timing and quirkiness. Wonderful. Owen Wilson was sort of reprising his ""Midnight in Paris"" character a bit but he was great too! I loved it from beginning to end. It's a lighthearted movie with lots of laughs that will leave you feeling good. Highly recommended.",positive
Yoga Hosers,"In the 90's, Kevin Smith became an icon with ""Clerks"", ""Malllrats"" ""Chasing Amy"" and ""Dogma"". Unfortunately along his next works, he has never reached the same success again.""Yoga Hosers"" is probably the bottom of his career, with an unfunny and annoying story. His daughter and Johnny Depp's daughter acting are terrible and they only had this chance because of the influence of their fathers with the producers. The name of Johnny Depp is embarrassing and used to lure the viewers. In the end, ""Yoga Haters"" is a means to spend 88 minutes of your life watching a comedy without laughing. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): Not available",negative
Yoga Hosers,I love Kevin Smith!!! I saw Yoga Hosers in the theatre and sometimes it's nice to see a movie that requires NO brain power! Johnny Depp did it for me! I love the Guy LaPointe character! I just laugh hearing him talk! I thought it was awesome!,positive
Stockholm,"There's something so amazing about a film that can keep you on your toes with it's fast-paced action and consistently funny antics as ""Stockholm"" does. Despite being a known true story of the origin of Stockholm Syndrome, the film was able to make me excited to see what happened next as it captivated me through well-written dialogue and incredible characterization of the few main characters. After watching this film and mediating on it for a while, I was struck by the fact that director Robert Budreau was able to perfectly capture the essence of the syndrome, even making me root for the captor, Lars Nystrom (Ethan Hawke), as the film progressed. I found it so interesting that the Budreau was able to do this with every detail, right down to the music. The music was easy to listen to being upbeat and chill, completely counteractive to the action on the screen but perfectly fitting to the character of Nystrom. The cinematography used in the film also helped develop this reaction as each scene was filmed to masterfully capture the emotion meant to be felt using dark versus light lighting and muted versus bright colors as they developed throughout the film, paralleling the unfolding character of Nystrom. This film was interesting and all in all wonderful to watch; I highly suggest you take the time to see it.",negative
Stockholm,"Stockholm can be described as a fun and comedic film, covering a dark subject matter in order to show its audience how human beings cope with stressful, life threatening situations. The film is based on the Swedish bank heist, and hostage situation, that would later inspire the coining of the phrase ""Stockholm syndrome,"" which describes the phenomenon of a hostage forming a bond with their captor. Of the many things the film does well, what stands above the rest is the films ability to make the audience realize how someone might actually succumb to Stockholm syndrome. The main anti-hero of the story, Lars (Ethan Hawke), shows early on that all he really wants is to get his buddy, Gunnar (Mark Strong), out of jail. You the audience member even find yourself sympathizing with him as over the course of the film he goes out of his way to care for his hostages including letting one of them, Bianca (Noomi Rapace), use the telephone to call her family. The comedy in the film comes across quite well, at some points I found myself audibly laughing, and allows the audience to establish a better connection with Lars. Apart from the story, the 70's aesthetics were executed perfectly with a very pleasing color pallet focusing on shades of orange and teal, wonderful b-roll of a 70's Stockholm, and a few Bob Dylan songs thrown in for good measure. It was very enjoyable to watch and had my interest peaked right from the get-go.",positive
Rapture-Palooza,"OK let me start off with a disclaimer. Being a raunchy comedy fan from Chicago, i am an unabashed Craig Robinson supporter. Dude paid his dues and routinely stole the show in bit parts in various Judd Apatow movies of the last decade. With that in mind, its nice to see Hollywood start to realize the mans considerable talents and start giving him some star vehicles that put them to use. never mind the god awful ""Peeples"", which was a failure more due to a horrific, unfunny script than Robinsons performance, Rapturepalooza is the movie that allows Robinsons irreverent, thoroughly raunchy comedic style to truly shine. I had tears in my eyes laughing out loud watching this movie. Granted the plot and premise serve as nothing more than a means to allow Robinson to go ape-sh#t with the material, its still not that bad. Anyone vaguely familiar with Revelations will recognize the subversive take on it and the pot addicted wraiths were pretty funny. That being said the main reason to see this movie is Craig Robinson. Hell change your view of what we were taught about the Antichrist..but in a rolling on the floor, tears in your eyes way... See this if your a fan of Pineapple express, Knocked Up and 40 year old virgin..",negative
Rapture-Palooza,"Just like the predicted Rapture of 2012 (as prophesied by Ronald Weinland of the apocalypticist COG-PKG), end of the world comedy Rapture Palooza proves to be something of a non-event.Despite a potentially very funny premise, and a promising start (the slo-mo credits sequence is surprisingly stylish), the film is extremely hit and miss, with the majority of gags being misses. Much of the humour relies on smut and profanity, which I have no problem with, but when I fail to find a vagina joke funny, we definitely have a problem!To make matters worse, the whole production has an air of cheapness about it, particularly the special effects scenes which look like someone knocked them out quickly in After Effects on their iMac (I suspect this may not be far from the truth).Overall, this is very much like that other terrible rapture themed comedy of 2013, This Is The End, only none of its stars are anywhere near as obnoxious as Seth Rogen.3/10, plus an extra point for getting Anna Kendrick into that white dress (which distracted me slightly from the dire comedy).",positive
The Smurfs 2,"The Smurfs 2 Zero Stars I Remember a long time ago when I Saw the smurfs cartoon, it was funny, charming, amazingly and whimsical, it had tiny blue creatures who battle gargamel and much more, but sadly the smurfs movie was a disaster and it made a big amount of movie at the box office and this one could be even worse, this is one of the most pathetic sequels ever made and one of the worst movies of the year so far, what a joke. this takes place 2 years after the events of the first film when the smurfs time traveled to new york, when in the case smurfette gets kidnapped by the naughties (one of the them played by a truly wasted Christina ricci in a what is she doing in the film like this) and the smurfs go to Paris to save her from gargamel and the naughties, Neil Patrick Harris is wasted yet again as the person who is trying to help the smurfs along with his wife, gargmel played by an embarrassed Hank Azaria of the simpsons fame who is completely lost.The CGI is impressive but so what?, the screenplay is simply a waste of absolute time, the story goes nowhere, the writing is pathetic and a editing is a complete disaster, sadly this is Jonathan winters last film and a pathetic one if that. this is a truly dreadful film that is even worse then the first, MUCH worseWait for avatar sequels in 2016 if that.",negative
The Smurfs 2,"Having already seen Despicable me 2 And Monsters University, these summer hols, I took my two kids to see Smurfs 2. I have to say, despite any toffee nosed film critics who have panned this film, we thoroughly enjoyed it. It was equally good, if not better than the two previously mentioned films. The animation, especially the interaction between real life and CGI was impressive. It was funny, fast-moving, and at times emotional. Gargamel's performance was wonderful. Some of the visual effects, such as the ""Roue de Paris"" coming of it's axle and rolling through the streets of Paris were amazing. Ignore the film critics, go there with your kids, and try and watch it through the eyes of a child and enjoy. Great in 3D. We thought it was better than the previous Smurfs movie.",positive
True Memoirs of an International Assassin,"This film tells the story of a man who struggles to write his first novel, which is about an assassin. When his book is released, his agent promoted his novel as a true story. Venezuelans abduct him and hence he gets involved in coups and assassination plans involving multiple fractions of the country.This is the first film I watched in 4K on my TV, and the picture quality is crystal clear. Yet, the mesmerising picture quality does not make up for the silly story. What happens in the story is very unrealistic and at times downright silly. However, there are a few moments when it is funny, such as the two CIA agents chatting in their office about the author. ""True Memoirs of an International Assassin"" is made to be a genuine brain-off entertainment.",negative
True Memoirs of an International Assassin,"I give this movie a perfect rating and here is why. I think movies should be judged in terms of what they set out to succeed. Movies should be judged within their own genres. There are few movies that exist that incorporate every genre and viewers should not expect a movie to be all things at once.That being said...this movie incorporates two genres, those genres being action and comedy. Withing the action-comedy genre this movie is completely without fault. This movie tries to succeed at being an action comedy and it does succeed, brilliantly. Hilarious male lead with his usual brand of slapstick humor but this time in a less self depreciating way, I like his brand of humor in an action setting, no fat jokes and more stylish action choreography. Good chemistry with the believably badass female lead. I do not know if she used a body double for the fight scenes but it was impressive either way. There are multiple villains and you never know which one is truly bad or good so there are some nice little twists there.I grew up in the 80s and lived on action flicks so this movie was awesome! Also I am not a fan of endless sex jokes and crude humor and this movie had non of it, just hilarious situations and slapstick action comedy at its best! I will not give away to much of the story because it is pretty simple to follow. Go watch it!",positive
Fist Fight,"this is by far on the top 3 'worst movies i've ever seen'. i don't usually write a review but i have to because i feel like someone grabbed me money & time.listen. first of all, i don't put comedy movies in the same 'judging eye' as other genres. sometimes you want to laugh, just enjoy the cinema with friend so don't think I'm comparing it to pulp fiction.this movie is so bizarre and not funny i think anyone with dignity to the movie making and not ""we want money no matter what"" should fire anyone connected to this one.script- no one in the WORLD talks like that, act like that, and those unrealistic moments so cringy i was embarrassed. ""plot"" - error 404 funny - didn't laugh even one time and all the theater was quiet 99% of the time.",negative
Fist Fight,"Movie keeps the entertaining throughout the entire movie, constantly wondering what's going to happen next. Ice Cube definitely played a good role in the movie Recommend to any friends Good Comedy for entire family. THe back and forth between ice cube and Charlie day is suspense full and enjoyable",positive
Smurfs: The Lost Village,"Four years after the second smurfs movie which didn't do well domestically but gets a reboot in this version, I will admit that I miss hearing the smurfs gags like the happy song and mentioning the word smurf but it should be enjoyable for fans of the cartoons. The film also has a new cast in which Demi lovsto takes over the smurfette role. Mandy pantankin takes over from the late Johnathan winters as papa smurf. Jack mcbayer takes over the clumsy role from the late Anton yelchin who was great in the role.",negative
Smurfs: The Lost Village,"This movie was a masterpiece in its own element! It was how I remembered my favorite cartoon as they ran through a forest, on an adventure, with that true Smurfs charm which really made me blush like crazy! Don't get me wrong, but the Smurfs and Smurfs 2 was pretty good and they were unique; but, this movie was the right way to do a Smurfs movie! This movie is such a treat! The family will love it! I am sure of it! And seeing it in 3D was even better! So I highly recommend seeing in 3D, it's worth the extra bucks!",positive
Like Father,"It's a shame Royal Caribbean didn't pay as much for a director and screen writer as they must have paid for the actors to sell their souls in this awful, cheesy, predictable movie. It was a nice nostalgic look at a Royal Caribbean cruise ship as we've just stepped off one. I'd watch it if you want to see Harmony but not if you want to see a decent movie.",negative
Like Father,"Finally we have a movie that's not about a non realistic love story, but one that does happen in real life and therefore, connects more people with the plot. Loved it!",positive
Cult of Chucky,"Cult of Chucky (2017) ** (out of 4) After the events from the previous film, Nica (Fiona Dourif) is now in a low-risk mental hospital where her doctor decides to really cure her by bringing in a Good Guy doll. This here sets off some strange events and elsewhere Andy (Alex Vincent) is trying to find a plan to defeat Chucky once and for all.There's no question that the first CHILD'S PLAY was a very good and entertaining horror film. The sequels that followed were all of mixed quality but the last film, CURSE OF CHUCKY, was in my opinion the best of the bunch and it gave me real hope for this one. Sadly, CULT OF CHUCKY comes as a major disappointment as there's really not too much entertainment to be had. They might have added more Chucky dolls but they didn't add much else.The film started off fairly good as we catch up with Alex and see how Chucky is still having an impact on his life. All is well when we're re-introduced to the Nica character and we see her trying to move on from her ""crimes"" of the previous film. Once we hit the mental hospital we get a ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST joke and it's pretty much downhill from here. It seems the screenplay was trying to tie too many things together and in the end none of it worked too well. You got the continuation of CURSE OF CHUCKY as well as the connection to the Alex character and the first three films. You've also got Jennifer Tilly showing back up so you've got the connection to BRIDE OF CHUCKY and SEED OF CHUCKY.You've got all of these connections to previous films but it just makes for a mess of a film. The movie really doesn't know if it wants to be a straight horror film or if it wants to take Chucky back to his comedian days. There are a lot of really lame jokes here that aren't funny and there are also a lot of pop culture references and these here are really lame. The film does go for some extreme gore during its death scenes and if you're watching the unrated version then you'll see some pretty graphic stuff.I thought Dourif, Vincent, Tilly and Adan Hurtig are all good in their roles. Brad Dourif returns to the role of Chucky's voice and he too is quite good. I'm not going to spoil the ending but it makes me interesting to see where future installments go but lets hope the screenplays are a tad bit more clear and not trying to do so much.",negative
Cult of Chucky,"It's a Chucky Flick, What did you expect? Chucky to give an Oscar winning performance! it's a horror flick & above everything else it's entertainment. if you going to dive deep into the plot, the acting , the message of the film, go watch the NOTEBOOK or something. this is Horror! Blood, Guts, & a few laughs is all that's needed! Hats off to Don Mancini, Jennifer Tilly, Brad Dourif, Fiona Dourif!!!!! I Don't care what anyone thinks, it's a good movie in my eyes!!",positive
The Longest Week,"This film tells the story of a man with ultra rich parents, who is suddenly broke after his parents cut off his allowance. He puts on a cover up and wins a woman's heart, yet he discovers there is something more to life.The interaction between Conrad and Dylan is realistic, thigh they both live in a world beyond most people's reach. Their intense competition between each other and yet almost accomplishing nothing is ironic, but I like the joke about the Volvo going back and forth. The romance subplot is very sweet and convincing, I enjoyed watching it.This is a romantic comedy with a journey of self discovery. It's a pity that the main characters Conrad and Dylan are portrayed to be rather unlikable and arrogant characters who have no clue about the real world. That's because the film is actually enjoyable and rather warm, and if the characters are a bit more likable, people would probably like it more.",negative
The Longest Week,"The first thought that came to my mind watching this charming comedy was- this is a witty homage to the great Claude Lelouch and his 1966 classic "" A Man and a Woman"" (""Un homme et une femme"" original title).Jay Israelson's music is simply beautiful. The repetitive critics on several portals of how this is a copy of Wes Anderson or Woody Allen, are incredibly narrow minded and surprisingly coming from big name news sources. Also, Django Reinhardt is fabulous on any occasion and does not need to be reduced to just association with specific filmmakers even if they are as brilliant as Mr. Allen. Those thoughts didn't even get to compete with the homage notion. Loved the writing and directing of Peter Glanz.Jason Bateman is just incredibly amusing in his quaint portrayal of Conrad Valmont, detached trust fund kid - man, or Billy Crudup's ever eccentric ways, both in dead on performances. All of the cast is just wonderful. Usually, the constant narration can be annoying, but in this case it is marvelously delivered by Mr. Bateman, in his unique matter of fact way. I highly recommend this movie.",positive
