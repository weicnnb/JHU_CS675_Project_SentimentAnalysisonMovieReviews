MSG: The Messenger of God,"MSG: ------------------ If you're planning to boost your confidence, & trying to come out of depression then you must watch this movie --> MSG: Messenger Because after watching this there won't be any bad thing left to worry about in life(as this will be the worst of all of them).The 5% of the movie is about the Holyman: Sant Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh ji Insaan etc etc, his enemies & how they are trying to kill him in different ways.. rest of the movie is about what all the powers the baba has & what all the great stuffs he has done for the society. Some powers are mentioned as follows: >Generating electricity with a tip of index finger. >Converting firing bullets to flowers >Snatching Guns, melting in air, then making a crown out of it >Hypnotizing 500s of goons & making them followers instantly >Killing terrorists with playing mouth organ >Breaking an entire tree into pieces with a single punch >Punching 1 car and making fly 7 other cars >Producing water from drought land >Flying the bike, landing to the air balloon with a powerful bomb, making it blast, then jumping it back to the exact same position & many more... Some Actions baba is doing: >running blood donation camp >running free food for poor program >drug addicts rehabilitation centers >prostitutes rehabilitation centers >orphanage free homes >Clean India mission >Rock nights for youth & basically everything what Govt suppose to do...The movie is a long non-ending commercial of Dera Sachcha Sauda.. Where it is claimed that baba has total 5 crores of followers worldwide.Music: If you like the noise of running generator, then you'll definitely fall in love with all songs of this movie, which baba only has sang. The only difficulties is to understand the language in which all songs has been recorded, definitely not Hindi or English. The songs can start at any time, you can not even predict it. It comes liked unwanted mosquitoes who comes uninvited in your room, produce noise, bites you, then left you with their irritating marks all over.When you expect the great story has been ended, it start all over again with a new 'thrilling' baba's adventure. One thing is for sure, whatever you dress in life, whats so ever designer dress you buy for yourself, you can never ever ever ever ever beat the baba's style & fashion senses... he is just too good for any Earth resident.Overall its a movie you must watch before die, to set it as a benchmark for the hardest thing you've ever done in your life.So Go watch now.. before its too late.... because PART2 is coming soon.... [**i am going on a mental break for few weeks now***]",negative
MSG: The Messenger of God,"MSG-The Messenger emerged as a social reforming movie in the film industry. The movie has raised various issues of improving the society by tree plantation, cleanliness campaign and ban on drug. The movie is explanatory that how drug mafia targets a country. Each and every song of the movie is dedicated to love with God. The song 'desh k liye 'is fully energetic. The acting of Suspense and other action scenes is beautifully played by all the actors.the last dialogue of the movie leaves its great impact on the viewer and give the true message about humanity and human beings. The direction of all the real happenings in the form of story is beautifully shown. Thus the movie is not as one has thought like pravachans but all the humanitarian service activities are beautifully pearled in the garland of MSG",positive
Vivegam,"This is another typical one man taking on hundreds of goons kind of movie. Do not waste your time and money on this piece of waste. Kajal is just a side character with no real importance at all and is just a filler. expected much after the success of Vedalam, but this is a plain mockery ! watch at your own risk",negative
Vivegam,"The reason for saying it is a must watch is because, at least after seeing this movie, the impression on Indian Action movies among the audiences will change. This is one hell of an action ride.The movie revolves around a SPY agent 'AK' and his quest to stop the people who wants to create artificial earthquakes using Plutonium weapons.I like this movie not because the genre is new to Indian Cinema. It is because the way they executed it. Apart from some cliché heroism like evading hundreds of bullets, the movie is executed upon a beautiful emotional quotient.The stunt sequences are too brilliant and the way it was conceived by the writer and executed by him. Coming to the story part, the writer(and director) Siva has come up with the usual spy story. But instead of exploring the story, he made it a cat and mouse game kinda screenplay. It itches a little bit when we see something that could've been explored better was left to be a thin plot instead.Pros : 1. Jet Speed Screenplay, 2. Action Sequences,3. Ajith's Screen Presence4. Siva's Direction5. No smoking, drinking, glamour scenes or vulgar dialogues.6. Screenplay talking about self motivation and positivity.Cons :1. CG could've been better.2. Climax is tooooooo f*****g dramatic.3. Predictable interval twist.I came by some reviewers saying it is not logical in some scenes (like the dam scene). I would say, ""Folks! This is how spy movies are made. This is how action movies are made. Period!!!"" If you can accept people falling from planes with their cars, why would this disturb you? Just because it is an Indian movie?? or because it is not directed by Shankar or Rajamouli?? Change your view people. Take pride when it happens.Overall: This movie is a treat for Action Movie lovers. It is a WORTHY PopCorn Flick. Go for it!!!",positive
Boss,The usual story with usual action sequences. The major disappointment in this film was they show the hero of the movie Akshay 30 mins after the movie starts. A commercial films must show the main character first.,negative
Boss,"the movie has lots of action scene which are excellent only and acting by all characters are amazing specially ronit roy and akshay kumar.when you see ronit roy you actually found that you hate ronit in this movie great job by him.when you see the movie you see lots of turning point and corners which are amazing. the movie show the loves for father which is very good point. when you see the when you never think for story in your mind it did not give time for it as the right song comes at right time which makes the movie more enjoyable, its the best dramatic action movie of the year. when i comes out i m only saying that it is the paisa vasool movie because it is,so never think about the movie go and watch it you love the movie.",positive
Recep Ivedik 4,"Recep Ivedik is an example of cinematic parasitism. It is a product created solely to profit from as many people as possible by providing as little content as possible.Outliving the sympathy generated by its humble beginnings, the series has become stale, endlessly recycling the same subject matter of a (once) lovable crude protagonist against the elite intelligentsia of the country. A mixture of slapstick and juvenile scat humor, it accomplishes nothing in the realm of comedy.A crude, cheaply filmed waste of time which is a shame considering the brave and creative strides Turkish filmmaking has taken in recent years.Technically embarrassing, this is one of those rare films which actually take an entire cinema industry backwards in progress. 2/10",negative
Recep Ivedik 4,It's not a waste of time. I recommend you to watch this movie. This is not the best of Recep Ivedik series but good movie.,positive
Srimanthudu,"How in the world did this movie get 7.9 rating in IMDb? Makes one really wonder about the credibility of these ratings.Predictable from beginning till the end.Clichés after clichés following a pathetic story line.Basically the same old story of every other commercial Telugu movie, different plot and cast nothing else.Nothing new,Nothing to entertain nothing other than the same old, same old.The hero kills like 20 people and walks away in spite of one of the dead being an ex minister. Really tests the amount of bullshit one can handle.I guess the people who gave this movie a rating higher than 3 have a really high tolerance for bullshit or you get the drift. Speaking of acting the hero barely has any comprehensible emotion on his face,same bland macho expression all the time.And to think shruti hassan was nominated for best ""actress"" for this film,Actors by definition should act not only look good on screen.But i guess whoever nominated her for the award doesn't even understand.No wonder shitty movies like this gets 7.9 rating....",negative
Srimanthudu,"Director Koratala Siva comes out with an unique subject and presents truly more than what he wrote. His screenplay makes you sit for around 3 hours without complaining about a single scene. As they said in the interviews every scene is connected to another and you never feel that a particular scene is wasted. Mahesh Babu is outstanding as usual and nobody can do well than him if this kind of script comes to them. Mahesh is stylish as usual and looking more glamorous too. Definitely he is going to surprise the fans and others with his stunning performance, which is his best so far. Shruti Hassan does a key role in the film, not only as a lead lady, but also forms the limb for the power packed screenplay. Jagapathi Babu and Rajendra Prasad along with other huge star cast plays every character perfectly and one cannot imagine someone else playing those characters on screen. Not even a single character got wasted and not even a single frame went useless. DeviSriPrasad comes out with a energetic performance again as said by many. Background score and songs are as usual rocking and Madhie is the man to talk about. He is the one who presented the vision of director Siva in an extraordinary way. Editing, Choreography and all other departments are flawless.Simply - Mahesh did another film which nobody can do and Srimanthudu turns another blockbuster in his career and Srimanthudu is truly a classic in Telugu film industry. You cannot compare this kind of films with any other films and you cannot imagine these kind of films in the future. Lets hope for the best.",positive
Kabali,"Let's be honest here, if this movie didn't have Rajinikanth, nobody would've given two f*cks about it because it's that awful and cringeworthy. It has to be one of the most lacklustre movies I've ever watched and comes as a huge disappointment after all the hype and media coverage it got. It's got an extremely banal plot of a Malaysian Tamil gangster Kabali, portrayed by Rajini, involved in a gang war with a local don. There's another storyline that runs parallel, that of his personal life which is even more insipid and overplayed. Radhika Apte as Kabali's wife has done a decent job but one cannot expect her to save a plot so weak that even the great superstar Rajini couldn't infuse life into. There's no humour, no punch lines, no message to take from the movie. In fact, the only time I laughed during the entire movie was when my friend walked into the door during the interval. The film went on in a monotonous manner until the end and the best moment was when the end credits rolled on, bringing an end to the viewer's suffering. Of course, a lot of Rajini fans loved the movie and said it was the best movie in the history of mankind but 5 minutes into the movie, any guy with a functional brain will know that it's all rubbish. Overall, I'd recommend not wasting your time on this lousy excuse of a movie made with the sole intention of cashing in on Rajini's reputation and raking up money.",negative
Kabali,"It is a very nice movie with limited songs and almost zero dance, Which is something special about this movie.Rajini lovers please watch the movie and please notice his dressing style. Its Awesome!!!Makeup Artist has done a great job.Dunno why people said its draggy, which I totally dint feel.Watch the movie and come to a conclusion, don't listen to what people say( Includes my opinion too).Please do not read reviews and go with the same expectation because people have different tastes.I personally liked every bit of it.Overall a nice move. Will not disappoint fans.",positive
Dügün Dernek,"One of the worst movies I have ever have seen. Deserved a zero rating but minimum was 1 so i gave it a 1, but in all honestly even a 1 rating is to much for this movie!",negative
Dügün Dernek,"The actors of this film are really funny.I really like Ahmet Kural and Murat Cemcir. But this film is like Recep İvedik. In their TV series , ""İşler Güçler"" the jokes are so funny. But In this film they are swearing too much. This film is OK. But isn't the best. I like the character ""Tüpçü Fikret"". He is swearing too , but his jokes are very funny. For example , If you want to see this film with your family , I don't recommend this , never do that. The wedding scene is very funny. I laughed , laughed loudly in this film. But the only problem , this film is like Recep İvedik. I think everybody should see it. But don't forget! Never watch this film with your family :)",positive
Celal and Ceren,"Well I don't know how to state this without sounding like a pessimist, but it was clearly the worst $10 I have ever spent. I had high expectations for this movie, the name suggests that it has a completely different setting than the actor/producer's previous movies (Recep Ivedik series), which were a complete disaster in my opinion, but unfortunately it was complete rubbish and I had to leave after 80 minutes. If you are fine with paying for a movie in which the most important element is people farting, then by all means, go ahead and watch it. If you are looking for your money's worth, buy some grass and watch it grow. It's way more fun and enjoyable than this movie. If you are really curious about why this movie got so many bad reviews, just wait until it's being sold in the $0.99 bin at your local grocery store. If you do, make sure to have a neurological check later on because it could really mess you up.",negative

Nothing to Lose,"This is a movie trying to pass itself as a biopic, but is just a fairy tale. It's trying to rewrite history to try pass an image of Edir Macedo, the guy who financed the movie, as a humble honest man of god.Besides all of this... the movie is placated with problem such as pacing, acting, directing, cinematography. In of itself it would be a bad movie... but since it's obviously just a propagandas piece just makes it worse.And lastly... If you pay attention. The movie was brigaded by bots, (or just lots of people with spare time) to give it 10 starts. The same has happened with every user review site... including specially Brazilians ones, where professional reviewed average score is 1 point.something... while user review is always 4 point something... almost 5 (out of 5).",negative
Nothing to Lose,"It was a speechless movie to watch. It's starts out with the main character being a different kid. Have you been that different kid that stood out in your childhood?
Than it goes on for him finding his real purpose in life. He becomes a recognizable leader that even made the catholic leader of Brazil a little shakey.",positive
RangiTaranga,I was very much excited to watch rangitaaranga after its rating on IMDb 9.1 but all my expectation failed. Expect for the song and cinematography the entire movie is overrated i don't understand why kannada people have lost there mind there is nothing new in the movie just by giving 2 twist doesn't mean the movie is the best in the history of KFI there far better movies done in kannada... and not to mention the acting of lead actors totally worst acting by both hero and heroine except for saikumar. it don't even deserve a udaya film award nomination.. wasted my 900 rupees. none of my friends liked the movie a total waste of time.it is better to skip or watch it in TV,negative
RangiTaranga,"There are horror movies which offer mainly jumpscares and there are some which will be haunting even after the movie. And then there's this new wave called RangiTaranga – which offers brilliant jump-scares and leaves you haunting even after you come out of the theatre. Not many movies can do that. RangiTaranga doesn't stick to one genre. Director Anup bhandari has played with the genres according to the neatly written and twisted but brilliant screenplay.The good news is Rangitaranga satisfies all kinds of audience be it frolic seeking janata or experience seeking world cinema followers. While normal audience can soak in the brilliant BGM and the creepy scares with frequent twists, the latter who can appreciate the technicality and the writing of the movie! There are actually more than one story to this movie. The main plot is about the haunted house 'Kamaruttu' and the theories and mysteries surrounding it! Like other movies even this had a similar format but interesting thing about this is the premise. It's surely something new to our audience and there's a lot of detail involved. And the director establishes some really good things and characters in the premise that keeps you thinking. Another story is about Gautham(Nirup bhandari) and Indu(Radhika Chetan) who come to Kamaruttu for a different purpose. And they have their own dark past to worry about. And the final arc is about Sandhya(Avanthika Shetty) looking for a writer called Anashku, who also heads to the same place.The purposes of these main characters, the mystery surrounding the place, their dark past and how these arcs connect together forms the main crux of the plot. Anup Bhandari has cautiously tried to narrate all these stories with a gripping screenplay and he has pulled it off brilliantly. Right from the first scene, the movie starts to cast its spell on the audience.The first half is mainly about introducing the characters,establishing the premise, providing clues and ending with a great twist while the Second half caters to revelations and connecting all the loose ends! Frequent twists keep the viewers intriguing till the end.Some scenes are really spine chilling, thanks to the amazing BGM by Ajaneesh Loknath who is definitely the third hero to this movie.Technically the movie is just perfect and they have not compromised anywhere. Cinematographers Lance Kaplan and David Williams should take a bow. The light setting, the camera angles are different and it uplifts the movie to a whole new level. People often confuse rich visuals with richly spent visuals but this movie defines what rich visuals and cinematography is. And the scares wouldn't have been this extremely effective if it wasn't for the editing! It is perfectly done most of the time! The pure Kannada lyrics for all the songs by Anup Bhandari is one more plus point to this movie. They are mostly situational.Coming to the performances, Nirup Bhandari looks good and for a debut he does a good job but should have done better in a few sequences. The two lead actresses are another great find after Nabha(Vajrakaya) & Priyanka(Ganapa). Avanthika gets to shine more than Radhika and they were great in their roles. Ananth Rao plays a good intimidating cop and other supporting actors do their job well. And there's another important character called KaaLinga Bhat played by Sai Kumar. After Kalpana he comes back with a brilliant role to play. His dialogue delivery, his presentation and his variation in acting is exceptional. There are minor negatives – Some dialogues lacked the feel and punch while a few questions are left unanswered, maybe they weren't relevant to the main plot nevertheless it's easily one of the strongest content dependent movie to come in the recent times after Krishna Leela.",positive
Recep Ivedik 5,"shame of the Turkish cinema. i can not understand how this film could be the most watched movie of all time in turkey. ""If you want to get an idea for a country, look at the most watched film in that country."" Sahan Gokbakar has nothing to criticize.

Bharath Ane Nenu,"Koratala Siva has directed a film that appeals to both class and mass groups. Learning from his mistakes in his previous films, especially from his weak and unsettlingly quick climaxes, he has drastically improved. As for the performances, Mahesh Babu has delivered one of the best performances of his career. Not only him, but all supporting cast members have also delivered aptly.What to expect: Political Drama with Commercial Indian Cinema ElementsPros: Storyline, Production, Cinematography, Direction, Performances, Dialogues, Background ScoreCons: Some Lagging Moments (Necessary for Character Development; Excusable)Final Rating: 10/10",positive
Waar,"I watched the movie with a great expectations after rave reviews and praise from friends! I heard a great things about its action sequences and storyline! But, watching movie resulted into sheer disappointment. Yes, this movie had great production value and great performances, the storyline is totally compromised and totally away from reality. The movie very well captures the emotions of common Pakistanis, but it totally misguides us. As always, the movie shows that India is behind all our problems and we are totally innocent. All the problems have been imported from outside. I believe that unless we will live in such ignorance and do not take full responsibility, we would not be able to address the actual problem our nation faces. Coming back to the movie, the performances, screenplay, camera-work and direction is one of the best I have seen in Lollywood for long time. But, the story is totally fictional and gives wrong message to nation.",negative
Waar,"Before i start,i want to clarify that I'm not a reviewer but merely a movie fanatic,so please excuse my poor language.Watch this movie for Spectacular edge-of-the-seat Action Sequences,A Strong Plot,Some Top-Notch Acting and the Best Music Score ever in a Pakistani movie,It totally delivers what was promised in the trailer.For a Pakistani movie,this is extremely good and an Average Pakistani will surely enjoy it.Great job by the whole team,especially Mr.Bilal Lashari,you sir have proved that Pakistan can come out of watching dumb downed action movies.I'm looking forward to your next project.Extremely well job for someone so young and talented.It was worth the wait.Detalied Review:-Visually Spectacular,eye candy scenes,Top-Notch Action Sequences and Cinematography.The Action Sequences are gripping and on par with level of Hollywood movies,and the Screenplay is handled perfectly,except for a few scenes,the movie doesn't lag throughout it's length,which I think is the best trait of an action thriller.Extremely well job by the whole Editing team for bringing us this great cinematic experience.-Direction is fresh and beautifully handled.Bilal Lashari delivered what he promised,and should be called a true perfectionist.His talent and enthusiasm reflects in each and every scene.The scene with the blend of Meesha and Shamoon's Waltz with Terrorist attack on police academy was an experiment done well.-Plot wise,the movie is a bit biased against India,but that's pretty much the truth we face today,it's RAW vs PAK throughout the movie,a few plot holes here and there but it won't disappoint.It is very solid and true to a great extent,shows us the facts that caused our current scenario.Thumbs up to Mr.Hassan Rana,who did a fine job.What i loved about it was that it doesn't offend the intelligence of the viewer.The whole movie was handled perfectly except the ending,which i think was was poorly executed and hurried.The melodrama should have been avoided.That's the reason I rate it 8/10-Acting wise,everyone did justice to their roles,particular mentions to Ayesha Khan and Hamza Abbasi for the brilliant chemistry,and Shaan was exceptional in his role of course,you give him a justified role,he can prove that he's so much more than an undead village superhero like his previous movies,with Khuda Ke Liye and Waar,he proves he is the best,and not in any way,less than any great actor you see in Bollywood or Hollywood.He is slowly evolving to perfection with each movie. thumbs up to Ali Azmat and Meesha Shafi who played their parts extremely well and made a great debut.Shamoon Abbasi fit perfectly in his role as a villain,he is evil and a perfect opposite match for Shaan.-Character Roles were a bit poorly developed and should have been given more thought.Dialogues were perfect,enjoyable and a wave of clapping pursued whenever Shaan came on-screen with his witty remarks.The Decision to shoot 90% of this movie in English can be justified,majority can understand the movie but i saw a guy sitting there who was being translated each and every scene in Urdu by his friend so he can understand what's happening,although Urdu Subtitles were available.-The Music Score of the movie is something worth particular mention,extremely great job by Amir Munawar and the whole team,the score is what that makes the scenes feel interesting and enthusiastic.The songs were emotional and energetic.On the whole,it was an enjoyable experience and we are proud to see Pakistanis coming forward and making great cinema.Don't miss it! It's a MUST-WATCH!",positive
Iftarlik Gazoz,"As you can read in other reviews and critics about the movie, it is not one of the typical Cem Yilmaz movies which are usually full of humor and sarcasm. The atmosphere and the characters, especially who speak the local accent, have made the film more realistic and hearty.The story is well written in the sense of unity and continuity. It holds the attention and curiosity of the audience on the story. But the plot is spread with the themes which are apart from each other. At first you feel like it is a movie showing the cruel times of Turkey in 1980s when the military took control of the country with a putsch and killed, tortured and imprisoned many people. But then you are confused because of the religious teachings and advice are being given by different characters in the whole movie.For example; the conservation between the ant and Adem about pilgrimage in his daydream. And the revolutionary conversations and sayings of Hasan make you think that it is a movie about the revolution or anti-capitalism. You can't get the gist of the movie because of these different and irrelevant themes mixed together. If you watch the movie from this perspective you catch lots of scenes like that. My interpretation about those superfluous religious scenes is that it is an effort to adapt the movie to conservative atmosphere of Turkey, which means not to disturb the community which is in charge with a conservative vision and also to expand the variety of audience. Except for the issues mentioned above, it is an enjoyable and at the same time heart burning movie.",negative
Iftarlik Gazoz,"I was born in 1993. I did not live in 70's-80's but i heard, read and watched so many stories about it. I'm not from Aegean Region.

It is an attempt to explain few things before you watch this film, so that anyone without a proper knowledge of what exactly the ""story"" wants to express to viewers will at least get an idea of what the film is all about.This film is about a boy and a girl who falls in love - a boy is from one caste and a girl from another caste. Problem rises between them because the fusion of different castes is not allowed in India. What exactly caste is? It is nothing but fabricated way of dividing a population into a ""caste"". The fusion of different castes as I said is not allowed and it is the religion that supports this notion.To the people who have no idea of how caste system works - be it people who live in India or live outside of India have to remember this only - It is this - Caste System works in two forms – In its preserving form, it makes intermarriage i.e. exogamy impossible and when caste switches to its religious form, it makes Untouchability prevailing in modern times.Rest, the film will do the talking!",positive
Manjhi: The Mountain Man,"With due respect to Nawaz's acting and the man 'Dashrath Manjhi' who did such an insurmountable task, I would like to say that this shouldn't be classified as a movie, neither should it be classified as a documentary. It is not even a one-time watch.In the worst case scenario, it is a one-time watch, but only till intermission. People making such movies should consider on tweaking the storyline so that the movie emerges out as a good experience for viewer. I don't know what people found interesting in this movie but I will try to summarize my experience in following points :1. Entertainment - 4/10 This is only because of the first half of the movie, which is decent in terms of providing entertainment value to the viewers. The second half will almost literally compel you to sleep in theatre. 2. Determination - 5/10 People are confusing psychotic fad shown in the movie with words like 'determination' and 'willpower'. 3. Romance - 7/10This is not even a complete story. It is just a 2 hour long fact that a man carved out a path out of mountain in memory (psychotic fad) of his wife who passed away in an accident on mountain.4. Action - 2/10 Almost nil. There is a lot of time devoted in the movie to show misdeeds by highbrow goons. Even till the end, the dots for their punishment doesn't get connected despite of the fact that they are involved till end in the plot with Nawaz's character. All we get is just an 'out of nowhere' loose scene.5. Adventure - 2/10 Except for the maniac mountain crushing there is nothing at all. 15 minutes of futile scenes showcase Nawaz's travel from Bihar to Delhi by foot just to make the premise of a useless 2 minute scene in Delhi. It may have happened in real as it is based on a real story but from a movie perspective it was absolute rubbish in order to portray determination of the character.",negative
Manjhi: The Mountain Man,"Expect no grandeur and very un-Bollywood-like. The plot of the movie unfolds quite slowly like a classic movie should be, building up gradually in the first half and then you are so engrossed into the movie, that you hardly realize how quickly the second half passed by. Nawazuddin Siddiqui could have been the only actor at of today who could do justice to this role. Ketan Mehta has made sure that the real touch in this movie sticks as close to the actual incidences and he has succeeded thoroughly. Many filmmakers attempt to use or portray the themes from this part of India (like Amir Khan's PK or Salman Khan's Dabang). One can easily find that genuineness of Bihari culture is so hollow that it brings down the impact of the movie, rather than uplift it. The way all the actors have delivered their dialogues or put on their costumes is phenomenal. Siddiqui's performance is a stand-out and without doubt, it'll a benchmark in Bollywood, IMHO. Craziness of Manjhi is a legacy for Indians and Siddiquit has succeeded in bringing that out on the silver screen.",positive
Knife,"I was encouraged to watch the movie and many friends recommended it on the lines that if you liked Ramana, you will like this movie. But for some reason, I found the script totally lacking common sense and showed the lack of depth in knowledge of the writers of the plot. The plot is centered around the struggles of villagers versus MNC(Corporate). The word MNC and corporate are overused in the movie, that it left such a bad taste to me. Maybe it would have been nice if someone explained Economics 101 to the writers of this movie. My distaste for the movie stems from the simplicity with which commercial Tamil movie makers want to handle the script - black versus white. Heroes versus villains. A lot of movies these days have transcended such stereotyping showing all possible greys, but this movie should have been made like 40 years ago, and then possibly it would have deserved all the praise. In fact a basic fact check would disprove the premise of the whole movie. Farmers earn more when they sell their land to acquiring corporates. It is simple market mechanism. If a beverage company dries out a river, it just means, we people are lazy and like to indulge in carbonated drinks. As long as there is demand, you cannot villify the firms for it. On a sidenote, both Pepsi and Coke follow sustainable practices for most part, and I would encourage the writers to check about it. And the farmers are none the poorer for selling their land to acquiring firms. See all the farmers driving BMWs in Gurgaon. And please for Godsake, companies do not collude as shown in the movie. If you want to switch off the real world and enjoy a masala cum emotional movie, then you will probably like this one. But please please do not come from the movie hall thinking the plot is real or even close to reality.",negative
Knife,"One of the best script and dialog's in recent Tamil movies. Vijay performed very well. Hats off to ARM sir and BGM is mass.Samantha is cute as usual.Neil Nitin Mukesh was perfect for his role.The message which was spoken in the movie is well conveyed and it will reach every corner of India. The dialog in the climax is class, Vijay delivered it in a very good manner. Dialogues in many scenes were too good.Only negative thing i feel that is the song placement.You can't compare Thuppakki with Kaththi, Thuppakki is an action thriller movie and Kaththi is an emotional social message movie. Overall the film is a blockbuster and a must watch movie.",positive
Go Goa Gone,"Go Goa Gone is truly one of the most hilarious Hindi films since Delhi Belly. It's a zombie comedy, with lots of blood and gore, so it's in no way for the squeamish, and the humor is quite mature, so it's NOT a child-friendly watch, but, hey, it's the subject matter itself which isn't really kid-suitable.Nevertheless, Go Goa Gone sets out to bring a new genre into Indian cinema with great gusto, and it fails to fail. With rib-tickling lines, great comic acting by Kunal Khemu, Vir Das, Anand Tiwari, and even Saif Ali Khan as the quirky, macho Boris (soon to be one of the greatest cult characters of all of Hindi cinema), Go Goa Gone FORCES you to laugh effortlessly.Yes, the plot gets a little dragging at the second half, and Puja Gupta's acting isn't very novel (although she looks great), but mostly, Go Goa Gone just always makes you laugh at one point or the other. I was chuckling at every other moment. The zombies are well-made, for a first in Bollywood, and nothing looks cheap. The action is pretty nice, and the songs are quirky and trippy.I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to have a good laugh-fest. Except the kids, of course...",negative
Go Goa Gone,"It's a rarity for Indian movies to step beyond the conventional(and convenient) love stories and venture into the unknown.'Go Goa Gone' tries that and does a commendable job.You have heard of romcoms,now there is a new genre and it's called 'ZomCom!'.The movie stars Saif Ali Khan,Kunal Khemu,Vir Das and many many zombies.There is good chemistry between the friendly trio of Luv,Hardik and Bunny.There's lot of slapstick humor,plenty of boisterous moments.The trio attend a rave party in Goa where all goes wrong.Thanks to a drug,suddenly zombies are spawning out of the blue and they are hungry for any human they can find.The trio find themselves stranded on an island with zombies all around and no way out.Enter Saif Ali Khan as a Russian mafia Boris.Off late Saif's acting has really transcended to a new level of confidence and this role is an example of that.His character is just so amazing.His dialog delivery with that Russian accent,his intimidating yet adorable looks,his intriguing persona-are all things you will love about him.You get a kick within when he says with that Russian accent- 'I kill dead people'.The rest of the cast has acted pretty good as well and i liked Kunal Khemu's(Hardik) performance.There are plenty of genuinely funny moments.Don't try applying your mind too much or connecting the dots,this one is just meant for fun.Watch it and enjoy!",positive
The Ghazi Attack,"As a veteran of the U.S Navy and the son-in-law of a retired LCDR in the Indian Navy, I was appalled by this movie.The technical aspects of submarine life as portrayed in this move are simply ludicrous. The list is endless, but here are four examples. 1) When a submarine employs active sonar (pinging), it immediately broadcasts its position to any and all who are listening. The proposition that an alert enemy would be unaware of the location of an active sonar source is absurd. 2) Torpedoes, even of that era, were not thunderous beasts, crashing through the water. They are streamlined, high-speed, killing machines that are as stealthy as the manufacturers can make them. 3) Seawater reaching the batteries, as shown in the move, would have released large amounts of poisonous chlorine gas and/or created an explosion sufficient to breech the hull and sink the boat. 4) During an active combat drill, members of the crew are shown at ease in the crew quarters. In a combat drill, every sailor has a combat station, and nobody would be idling about in their quarters.Even worse, is the unprofessional and incompetent behavior imputed to members of the INS. The assignment of a psychologically unstable officer to command a submarine is unthinkable. Verbally bullying his subordinates, brandishing a pistol, drinking alcohol with his subordinates while on duty (and he was a Sikh!) - these are not qualities associated with anyone who would even be considered for submarine command. To state otherwise maligns the integrity of the admirals who commanded the INS in general and the submarine forces in particular. Undoubtedly, there is a very interesting story to be told about the sinking of the Pakistani submarine, quite possibly involving bravery and heroism on the part of INS forces, but this movie is not that story. The lengthy disclaimer displayed on the screen and read aloud, in full, prior to the start of the movie, does not justify or excuse this collection of junk technology and transparent appeals to blind, unthinking patriotism.",negative

1 - Nenokkadine,I should say 1 nenokkadine is a kind of experiment in tollywood as we experience them very low especially from a star.The story is simple and the screenplay plays the magic role and it still needs to be tightened.The plot used to narrate it is quite unusual for telugu audience.Editing is average and music provides great strength.coming to performances mahesh babu who never fails as an actor is main strength of the movie.His look was a feast to his fans and his expressions in emotional scenes were top notch.kriti sanon played her part well.I should really appreciate director for choosing a different subject to provide audience a different experience in Hollywood style.But the main problem in the movie is it lacks sufficient suspense to hold the audience to their seat.The psychological problems of the main character creates problems for the common man to understand it.This movie is understood by each person in their own way.Some hate it to hell and some love to coreCinematography should be mentioned specially as it is heart of the movie.Stunts are good and twists make you stick to the story between some loose scenes.Overall it reaches high mark on Hollywood movie lovers and common telugu audience must see it in different way but not by routine telugu film formula,negative
1 - Nenokkadine,if you are a regular telugu movie fan....u will never develop yourself......It is a complete different movie and just rocking... mahesh performance was awesome and overall movie was a top class......those who want to watch a different telugu film apart from regular films....1- NENOKKADINE is the best choice i recommend.....Frankly speaking i enjoyed the film a lot .. Kriti sanon plays the role of journalist who was perfectly apt for the character The movie contains a lot of twists which makes the film more interesting.... Mahesh babu dances are the best so far.... songs are upto d mark....,positive
Theri,"The only appreciation I can provide for the Theri team is the dialogues between characters which is something different in a vijay movie which usually filled with 'punch' lines and other various 'hero' lines. This is where my 1 star comes from.Otherwise, this movie is utter rubbish. I have written the main events in this movie below. As you read, you can clearly see how stupid it is. The main character in this movie is a cop shown as both honest and intelligent in the earlier scenes. However, he quickly becomes brash and thick-headed. Hero kills a politician's son and boldy declares that he did it to the politician itself (how clever). As a result, politician attempts to kill him by sending mercenary, but hero beats them up and goes back to the politician asking him to stop. Enemy waits for the right moment and attacks. Hero loses his wife and mother while he barely escapes with his daughter and goes into hiding from his enemy. Expectedly, enemy finds out that he is alive and comes after him. The hero decides that enough is enough and goes after the enemy and destroy the enemy. I have lost hope in Tamil movies. It is rare to find movies with a good story nowadays. I am dumbfounded by the 7.5/10 rating this is movie.",negative
Theri,"For me, This is one of the Top 3 best Vijay movies ever. Perfect Mass Entertainer with a good message. It's all about how good parenting can destroy the evil in the society. Ilayathalapathy Vijay's & Samantha's Best Performance till date <3 The Outstanding feature was its Cinematography/Visuals by George Williams - Class :D GVP's Songs/Music/BGM - Awesome work and Goosebumps along with Vijay's Extraordinary screen Presence :) It has all the elements to satisfy the fans and the neutral audience. I didn't get bored even for a nano second and it was worth every penny you spend. The Technical side of the movie was astounding and ATLEE proved he is Shankar's best assistant director. The Three getups of Vijay was really cool.The movie ends like THERI 2 is on the way. All the credit goes to the Director - Atlee, He waited 2 years for this film and he is one of the youngest director in India to work with a superstar in the second movie itself and to gross 100 crores which will happen very very soon. He has told before itself the story will be very simple with a fantastic racy screenplay, credits to Editor Anthony L Ruben for that. Overall it will be very satisfying for all the audience and won't disappoint anyone. SUPERB ENTERTAINER. One of the best Action/Thrillers in recent times. Totally Loved it <3 Rating - 4/5",positive

GOLD,"When one have a story more precious than gold, then one needs to make sure that it's not always about making money.
By taking an actor like Akshay, whose slapstick comedy films r simply making money, then it shows that the producers were jus greedy to cash in on the success of the star value.
Rather than paying attention on the screenplay n direction, it all became melodramatic with Akshay's repeated overacting.
All the other good actors were sidelined.
Unnecessary romantic story, with unnecessary songs.
I was wondering did I pay to c the biopic on the historical win or a coach's story fabricated with too much melodrama n overacting.",negative

Ali Baba ve 7 Cüceler,"Before I start of how i think about the picture, I would like to emphasize that I am a big fan of Mr. Yilmaz's stand-up comedies as many millions of people in Turkey. However if one must talk about the movies Yilmaz personally wrote and directed, then we come up with a conclusion that he is not as successful as he is as a comedian on the stage. The term of being successful is also too generous for someone to mention that kind of works. What are the requirements for a work to be called as a movie? That must be the first question for a person whose claim is to write the screenplay and direct a picture. And these requirements are not that simply to obtain as we can already observe form Cem Yilmaz's works. He has a great potential but have not gone many step forward since he started filming career. In every work he plays, his character acts identical with the character from the previous work. It is much the same person although their names differ from each other. The main and the biggest problem lies on the screenplay and directing. That are point where Mr. Yilmaz should be criticized. When we watch him as an actor in movies which he only acts and got no effects on directing and screenplay he is much more better. What he should be doing for his next work and what he is gonna make will be so different i am one hundred percent sure of that. Because he is not such kind of a person who evaluates the commentaries in a positive way.",negative
Ali Baba ve 7 Cüceler,"I didn't have the opportunity to watch the movie yet. But who cares, it is a Cem Yilmaz movie so it doesn't have any other chance than being a great work. I'll come and edit/rewrite my comment here after watching the movie. And if you ask why i am writing this, the answer is that i want to show you guys, to rate and review a movie you don't have to watch it. Knowing about the previous works of the writer/producer/starring actor would give you enough information about a movie. Here it takes us to the question what is watching a movie is? Is it seeing the every little detail in the movie and watching each frames the movie has? I watched the poster for 114 minutes and i consider myself as i watched it. Yes maybe I'm giving an extreme example but that is only because i want to take your time and stop you and make you think on the definition of ""watching a movie"". What makes a movie, a movie is everything about that movie. From the poster to the advertisement, every material and literature about that movie. So here i am reviewing it according to all other things except from the movie itself.Note:For those who are going to read this review and decide to post it or not, do not be deal breakers and let people read this review and smile.

Perhaps there's a bit too much a bit silly music in it (NOT the songs - those are brilliant), maybe the climax scene is a little too long. But believe me, those are minor flaws; what you remember when leaving the cinema is a delightful mixture of a classic whodunnit, a funny (sometimes very funny) comedy and a modern look on Muslim religion illustrated by very well thought over photography (the Turks have been getting us used to it lately) and flawlessly performed (see the last comment).

I,"I, directed and written by Shankar whom claims that he has delivered/conveyed a ""Masterpiece"" which was starred by Vikram, Amy Jackson in lead roles in ""I"". The soundtrack and the BGM were composed by the two-times academy award winner A.R.Rahman who has done a prodigious job.Now, let us bounce to the plot and the direction. The plot was very predictable, I would like to emphasize the word ""very"". I watched ""I"" with my family and friends and they predicted the whole story after 30 minutes of watching the movie. The plot is like the whole sum of ""Cliché"" The direction was a ""so-so"" or ""run-of-the-mill"" job done by Shankar.The action sequence should be seriously highlighted. As I've read all the other reviews, the action sequence in the bodybuilding competition were praised continuously. In my view, I just realized that a light bodybuilder just lift two heavy bodybuilders at the same time which is beyond the capabilities of human beings. Can Arnold Schwarzenegger do that?Moreover,Director Shankar spent to much on the 5 minute video song sequences. Director Shankar keeps saying that ""I"" is a different movie and it would make an impact globally, I disagree. ""I"" is a typical Indian Tamil musical romantic thriller that has a very weak and predictable plot but Vikram's hard-work is noteworthy and praiseworthy.The CGI is placed erroneously in the movie. Honestly, the CGI is only placed in the song sequences and it is very bad for a big budget movie. I guess ""Avatar"" is way more better than this garbage and it has a lower budget than ""I"".In a nutshell, ""I"" did not hit the spot; dreadful.",negative
I,"I usually do not write reviews on IMDb. But i have to make an exception to this movie. This is the one hell of a epic movie i have watched till date.

He proved once again that he is not just a great actor, but also a hard worker too.AR Rehman music is a real treat. Trust me, you will loose yourself listening to music. Apart from vikram, every other co actors did their job well.Overall this movie is best one to watch this weekend.

Fack ju Göhte 2,"The fact that this movie was big here in Germany explains perfectly why there are so few good ones coming from here. I love silly humor, but this movie's humor is so low-level, wow... the story is not only foreseeable (which you'd expect from a movie like that), it's also completely bananas, full of stereotypes and flat as hell. The characters are hardly describable as one-dimensional, because I don't know if you can call one single character treat per part a dimension. Don't watch it, you're gonna be very unsatisfied.",negative
Fack ju Göhte 2,"Somebody please give director Bora Dagtekin carte blanche to shoot in Thailand! This is already the second time that he has taken a successful franchise out of Germany to an exotic paradise island in the sun. This worked very well with ""Türkisch für Anfänger"". In Fack ju Göhte 2 it's more a chance for the cast and crew to work on their tans than anything. In order to give the expensive location at least some justification, there is a bizarre subplot of orphans of the 2004 tsunami catastrophe who are destitute, have access to jetskis and are lead by an Austrian waif. Zeki, the coolest teacher ever since Robin Williams climbed onto a table, induces them to dive for diamonds with free McDonald's vouchers, and yes, there is a general abundance of inane script writing as well as product placement. Luckily, there is also an abundance of witty exchanges between Zeki and his chav wards. I didn't care about the location, and, although I didn't expect Doctor Shivago, I would have liked to see a better, more grounded plot. The running time of almost two hours is excessive and the story runs paper thin at times. But I have to admit that I had myself a laugh.PS: I just watched it for a second time. Basically, a fun movie until the gang of Tsunami orphans comes into play. Also, a lot of the scenes are copy-pasted from Hangover II.",positive

Brothers,"The Karan Malhotra Directed Movie is a Brilliant Mixture of Emotions and Action. Akshay Kumar-Sidharth Malhotra's Flick has the ability to grip your mind for the whole 156 Minutes. Karan Malhotra has directed it Brilliantly and the Duo(Akshay-Sid) has executed marvelously. According to me, Everything in the movie is perfect. From the Love of David for Monty to the Hate Monty Develops for the Elder Brother. The Tournament R2F is a revolutionary idea in the field of Street Fighting. The Villains and goons of the street become the hero of the country. For Me, The Fights of Monty were the best parts of the movie. Like how he knocks out the champion with just one punch and the next fighter within the first round. The Attitude of Monty was perfect too. Like How he Quits the ring even before the decision of the referee. Also David proves to be the most cleverest fighter of the tournament. He defends himself in the first and second round and then attacks in the third round when the opponent is tired. The Love of Jenny for David and the Affection of David for her daughter was remarkable. The guilt of Gary Fernendez, the hate-and-then-love of David for His Father, the Item Number of Katrina Kaif, The Choice of Fighters, the inspiration of the two brothers, the upsets of the tournament and everything was perfect and I would recommend this Movie as a must watch for everyone. I guess this is another 100-cror movie from Sidharth Malhotra after Ek Villain.",positive
Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran,"I had a very high expectation for this movie as it was based on one of the best success stories of India. However, the way the movie has been portrayed left me completely disappointed. This was supposed to be a serious movie, but to the extent the commercial flavour that has been added to it completely ruins the experience. I was expecting more of Madras Cafe kind of vibe from this movie. THIS MOVIE DEMANDED THAT!I hate when my experience during climaxes of a film is spoiled. Even if a film couldn't do well throughout but handles the climax perfectly, I tend to ignore everything else and like that movie. But in this movie, the climax happened to be the most terribly executed part of the entire movie. The tension build-up was too cold I would say.Some long dialogue deliveries really felt like he/she is DELIVERING A DIALOGUE. Good camera work could have hidden it. I found necessity of no songs in this movie. But they did it, because commercialism had to be done!Ashwat Raina's (i.e. John Abraham) family who has been emphasized so much at the first quarter of the film has been completely ignored towards the end. Just a phone call wasn't enough.The background score in some parts were terrible, giving me the feel of daily soaps. I expected that when I saw it was a production of Zee Studios.All-in-all the the style adopted for this movie was completely unsuited.I understand we are having our nationalism sentiments associated with this event and hence we are feeling good about this movie. But the way this movie was made, I couldn't resist myself from disliking it. Pokhran was one of the best stories India could have made movie on, but definitely not like Parmanu.I wasn't able to recollect any of those proud feelings that I felt when I first read about this India's proudful Pokhran Test success story, by watching this film.
Just two things I liked about this movie I want to mention:
1. The round trolley shot of Abraham at the beginning where he explains about India's need to become a nuclear state,and
2. Boman Irani (he did his best, but still poorly directed)",negative
Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran,"It's a shame that I really had almost no idea about the event it's based on. That very event changed the world's perspective towards our nation and it was indeed a proud moment for us all. PARMANU: THE STORY OF POKHRAN is a mindblowing film. It not only stays true to the event but also makes sure that those who didn't know about it would be able to experience it in a stylish way.PARMANU is a very tightly scripted film. There are thrills, drama and some cool action. Everything is balanced so perfectly that I felt it couldn't get any better than this. There's almost no flaw to find and the lack of musical numbers ensures that a wider audience embraces the film. There are no commercial compromises, and the director has mixed all the elements perfectly to give you a touching patriotic story which proves that unsung heroes can be remembered and honoured on any day. John Abraham is fabulous in this film. He plays a different kind of role and impresses totally, especially in the climax and an action sequence in the second half. Well, I didn't really need to say that since we all know that he's an action hero. This time, he doesn't really play one, but still reminds us of the excellence with which he has mastered this genre. Boman Irani is extraordinary: give him any role and he's gonna play it his way, the perfect way. Diana Penty is impressive and her character is neatly written. Rest of the cast does a splendid job.The review would be incomplete without praising the film's director, Abhishek Sharma whose skilful direction has helped the film become what it became: A perfect entertainer and thought-provoking historical action drama/thriller which also allows for some natural humour to breathe in.Enough of the bashing by critics. This film is awesome and is capable to entertain all ages. PARMANU: THE STORY OF POKHRAN is much more than just a history lesson: it's a phenomenal historical saga which realizes its strengths and thus chooses to remain totally realistic. If you like action dramas/thrillers based on real events, then I would like to congratulate you, since you're definitely in for a treat.",positive
Vishwaroopam,"After reading all the ""awesome"" reviews here I decided to give this movie a go. The movie starts off well but as soon as they start showing Kamaal Hassans past it becomes completely dull. There is no connection between the scenes from his past and future. The plot makes no sense at all. I had to fast forward to see the ending but was disappointed there too. In order to find out what happens next you need to wait for its sequel which I'm sure will be as pathetic as the first. Kamaal Hassan just wanted to show his audience that he too can do a spy role. Please refrain from watching this film. It will save 3 hours of your precious time. My verdict 1/10",negative
Vishwaroopam,"Brilliant story of a spy that is often seen in Hollywood movies. Characterization of Kamal and Rahul Bose as people from same religion (Islam) and fighting for a cause from different perspectives, say it good and bad. The thrilling screenplay that gives surprise every second, while revealing the past of Kamal Haasan. Technical brilliance in action scenes which really takes Indian cinema to next level. Kamal Haasan once again makes sure that his creativity is beyond the imagination of Indian audiences and surprises you every moment.There is nothing controversial in the film as it just shows the two sides of coin. Like a Jamesbond film highlights Britain, Spielberg film highlights America, this Kamal's movie has highlighted Indian spy system. Besides that, this legendary actor commands huge respect for his technical brilliance.However, the movie might appeal only to urban and A-center audiences, as there is no entertainment factor. And, adding entertainment in a movie like 'Viswaroopam' is like degrading the very meaning of creative intelligence. But the enormous budget mounted on this flick, is surely a risk, if Kamal aims only at Indian market.",positive

Varalakshmi Sarathkumar's character had a great villain potential, but screen time was really less and the character went under utilised. Keerthi Suresh and Yogi Babu didn't have much role to play. The first song felt unnecessary.Overall a decent one time watch.",positive

The simplicity of the the time yet the attention to detail in every scene adds visual appeal that is so palpable, yet blends with the movie without distracting from the theme and characters! I loved it. You should too! Movies such as Lootera is the reason I continue to come back to Bollywood for more! Contrary to common opinion, I found the movie to flow at a perfectly normal pace. There is a major event, twist or turn every couple minutes to keep the story moving along. Any faster and the movie would seem rushed. We all had our jaws dropped at the intermission. The first half was simply superb!",negative
Lootera,"Neither ""Pakhi""(Sonakshi) nor ""Varun""(Ranveer) are the main character of this film. Now if you think that i am joking then you should watch it. For me the main character of this movie is SILENCE and it is something awkward for a Hindi movie nowadays but that's true. The whole movie is show through silence , eyes , facial expression , visuals, surroundings and last but most important background score. This movie is not going to create the kind of magic that ""Udaan"" did but its a different genre movie and very real.

You expect a very high production quality when you think of how easy to fund this movie with government sources but the director fails again. Obviously he has problems with modern art and contemporary story telling. Acting was also not satisfactory but it was the least disastrous part of the movie.

Aruvi,"The film is overly dramatic, gross at times, and awful! The movie sends a message that living with HIV is equivalent to death sentence. HIV is a manageable chronic disease and it is not the end of the world.The director does not have his facts straight about HIV. HIV does not progress to AIDS (which is now called stage 3 instead of AIDS) for 5-10 years after the person is first infected. So, how come the lead character experiences weight loss and AIDS related symptoms in such a short span of time?Also modern day HIV medications do not cause hair loss as a side effect and hair loss is generally not a symptom of HIV. The weight loss accompanied with it would have made sense 15 years ago when HIV medications were not technically advanced. It is highly misleading to portray HIV as a ""death sentence"" while the reality is far from it. This movie will scare any sexually active person into thinking that HIV could kill them.",negative

Organize Isler: Sazan Sarmali,"This movie is 10/10 because it had a brightening and optimistic comedy side to it. Since we were getting used to all the ""cheesy"" and ""bad quality"" sarcasms for so long in the Turkish film industry.. I have not been into a quality comedy movie in so long, I had to leave the theatre one time. Looking at it from this perspective; the movie was very very good. The script was well-written, each character was distinctive and the visuals were great. It showed a different side of Istanbul. The first movie was filmed in 2005 which sounds surprising, however, the movie was still original. The jokes were original and the movie synthesized other issues aswell, such as dad-daughter relationships which made us laugh but think at the same time. Kivanc Tatlitug was very successful with his acting. Well-done, Yilmaz Erdogan, you did not let us down once again! This is the quality we have been missing for so long.",positive

And that for many reasons: it's a great movie per si! It's original, dense, poetic, emotional.

Truman,"Winner of five Goya Awards (the Spanish equivalent of the Oscars), this bittersweet comedy/drama about two men and a dog screened during the recent Spanish Film Festival earlier in the year. It was one of the more popular films in the festival and now it gets a cinema release. This amusing and deeply affecting film deals with universal themes of friendship, mortality, coming to terms with death, and it is sure to appeal to audiences. Julian (played by Argentinian actor Ricardo Darin, from Wild Tales, etc) is an Argentinian actor who has relocated to Madrid where he performs regularly on stage and television. He has been diagnosed with cancer, and after undergoing chemotherapy for a year he has decided to stop the treatment. He is resigned to his fate and sets about setting his affairs in order. Most importantly though he is trying to find someone to care for his beloved pet bull mastiff Truman, and has approached neighbours and strangers. His childhood friend Tomas (played by Spanish actor Javier Camera, from Living Is Easy With Eyes Closed, etc) relocated to Montreal but arrives in Madrid for a surprise visit. he hopes to change Julian's mind and convince him to go back to treatment. Tomas is sensible and restrained whereas Julian is more volatile and emotional in nature. Over the course of the next four days the two men reconnect as they wander the streets of Madrid, talking about their lives, loves, regrets and the future. There is also a side trip to Amsterdam where Julian briefly visits his son, whom he hasn't told about his decision. Truman is largely a two hander as it follows the two friends, although there are a few secondary characters with whom they briefly interact, including Julian's concerned and embittered sister Paula (Dolores Fonzi). The film has been directed by Cesc Gay (A Gun In Each Hand, etc), who handles the material in understated and sympathetic fashion. A droll vein of humour permeates the material. Gay, who co-scripted the film with Tomas Aragay, avoids becoming too sentimental, although the ending is effectively moving. The pacing is leisurely and gives audiences plenty of time to identify with Julian and Tomas. Camera and Darin are two of the most popular stars in their respective countries and they develop an easy going rapport here that seems natural. Gay's warm, honest and humorous script gives the two actors plenty to sink their teeth into and they reveal different layers to their characters. Darin is reunited with Gay, who directed him in A Gun In Each Hand, and he delivers a soulful and subtle performance here. Camera's low key and sympathetic performance here as the stoic Tomas offers a nice contrast. And the dog who plays the titular Truman is also superb; with its sad eyes and hangdog expression it has a warm and humorous presence. Gay and his cinematographer Andreu Rebes (A Gun In Each Hand, etc) make the most of the scenic Madrid locations, which add to the film's winning flavour. Truman is a winning, low key and moving variation on the familiar buddy comedy sub genre.",negative

Mulk,"It's not about targetting a certain religion.What should people understand is the fact that it's streeses more on ""how to be a better human'.A film like Mulk is something that was needed in the present era.Powerful performances from Taapsee Pannu and Rishi Kapoor,and not to forget Ashutosh Rana(deserves a special mention) takes the film to a whole new level.It's really sad to see that when a film like Mulk,having some real good content,is created,some people try to give 1/10 even without seeing the film,just for the sake of giving it some religious and political colour.Give this one a try.I bet you won't be disappointed at all.",negative

An absolutely fantastic film, with a message that could not be more relevant to the times that we live in, is being deliberately given low ratings just so that people don't watch it.

Just to add, even by cinematic standards, this is a great movie. Sure there are some flaws here and there, however the message that the movie tries to convey, outshines every single one of them.

The Bride of Humpty Sharma,"Humpty Sharma ki Dulhania, Shashank Khaitan's film, is an attempt to relive the magic of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, but definitely in its own way. DDLJ was one of the major blockbusters that Bollywood industry has seen and it gave a new attitude to the youngsters. Humpty Sharma ki Dulhania may not be the DDLJ of this decade, but yes, it is a movie in a true filmi style and it would bring smile to your face for sure. It does not ride high as far as logic is concerned. The movie definitely has some warm and emotional moments. The story is definitely predictable - girl meets the boy, both fall in love in spite of girl's engaged status, and then the pursuit for marriage by taking efforts to get the approval of family. The movie sticks to its core purpose – entertainment in filmy style, romance, comedy  This movie is for that segment of audience who just wants to watch movie for sheer entertainment and can't tolerate rona-dhona.Attitudes of the lead protagonists Rakesh 'Humpty' Sharma and Kavya Pratap Singh (Alia Bhatt) are shown initially itself in almost parallel frames, one being a carefree 'cool' Delhi guy, who flirts, always ready with witty one-liners and the later one a feisty Ambala girl. Humpty has friends Shonty (Gaurav Pandey) and Poplu (Sahil Vaid) who are always there for him. Humpty is shown to share great friendly relationship with his father (Kenny Desai). Humpty is a hard-core DDLJ movie fan, who still weeps towards the end of the movie. Kavya wears her attitude through the tattoo 'Pataka' on back side of her neck. According to her - ""Main to paida hi hot hui thi"". She is part of a rich family who is engaged to a NRI. She negotiates with her father Pratap Singh (Ashutosh Rana) to get her designer Lahanga worth 5 Lakhs. The logic is she did not get a chance to choose the guy, so at least she should get the right to choose her lehanga. Also, her friend Gurpreet of Delhi has bought a Lehanga of 2.5 Lakhs, so she should go for a lehanga of at least double the price. Kavya makes all these scenes very very enjoyable with her innocence. When Pratap Singh sweetly says no to her lehanga demand, she informs the family that she is going to Delhi (her uncle stays there), would earn and buy herself designer Lehanga and return after attending her friend Gurpreet's (Guncha Narula) marriage. Kavya meets Humpty in Delhi in a hilarious situation. Let me not reveal the same. Humpty and Kavya hit off instantly. They do fight, enjoy parties, competes over guzzling beer. Banter between the two is fun, natural, lovable. Both move ahead without any serious ties. They collectively help Gurpreet get out of a messy situation. And then the moment comes, when Kavya has to come back to Ambala. Shashank Khaitan has not redone Raj-Simran here, when Humpty and Kavya bump into bed soon after they feel for each other. Both of them try to move on lives in their respective cities without each other, but unable to do so. Humpty comes to Ambala along with Shonty and Paplu. Yes, a series of physical assault happens once family learns of Humpty's love for Kavya, but the tone of the violence is mellowed down. Humpty manages to get some time from Pratap Singh to prove him that he is the right choice for Kavya, better than the NRI Angad Bedi (Sidharth Shukla). Humpty's challenges increase when Angad does the entry into the scene as Mr. Perfect.How is Angad as a guy? We know that Humpty and Kavya would unite at the end, but how? The treatment to the plot is done in a very light-hearted manner. How does Pratap Singh yield? How does Humpty win Kavya's family's hearts?Cast is just superb. Ashutosh Rana as Kavya's father is very good. What a wonderful actor he is. He pours his intensity as well as sense of humour into the character. Varun Dhawan has done complete justice to his character. Alia is also wonderful. Her face has the right combination of innocence, chirpiness, traditional, bindass attitude. She makes Kavya so much lovable. Sidharth as Angad Bedi has great screen presence. I just wish, Sidharth's role could have been a bit longer and his vanishing from the last frames could have been given different treatment. Both Sahil Vaid and Gaurav Pandey as Humpty's friends and Kenny Desai as Humpty's father are all adorable, excellent performances from them. Rest of the cast are also good. Music could have been better. The song 'Samjhawan' composed by Toshi- Sharib and sung by Shreya-Arijit is very good.",negative
The Bride of Humpty Sharma,I just created an account now in IMDb just to write a review about this crap that I watched few hours ago. I cannot believe people are rating up to 3 stars out of 5 and 6.1 rating!!! I just wish there was zero or negative in the vote!If you are a big DDLJ-SRK fan please stay away! I think these people have lost their mind and they think people who watch movies are stupid and mean enough to like an awful story like this. Have this director ever watched DDLJ??? I personally feel that this is perfectly crafted to mock and insult the lovely performance of SRK and Kajol in DDLJ!!! Boy I wish they would never watch this pathetic movie. I have no idea why Karan Johar would agree upon something like this. The way modern Indian culture depicted in this movie is so condemnable. Please don't watch this movie guys or you will want to slap the director and the actors for choosing this script. 'Normal Human beings' will definitely hate this movie. May be they should try showing this movie to Zombies so that they could eat these peoples brains and just kill them right away!,positive
Jai Ho,"Another year, another aam admi focused movie (in 2013 it was Singh Saab). It is difficult to talk about a Salman movie because lately he has been pretty much formulaic. All his movies are essentially Salaman playing himself along with improbable action, and stupid comedy- the audience though has been lapping it up, prompting a whole generation of solid actors go the Sallu way.Salman plays Jai, essentially a do go-oder, a mathematical genius who can multiply up-to 3*3*3*3, (after that he needs help), an ex army-man with a heart of gold who likes to give bad guys an earful before ending their thankless existence. In today's times, think Somnath Bharti on steroids. Like a good old cowboy he strides around dishing punishments, cracking skulls, breaking bones and occasionally killing anyone who does not adhere to his definition of good, but reserves exceptional ferocity to goons who lays eyes on his family. Jai's eureka is to start a people's movement based on the concept of paying it forward when you do a good deed. But then Salman Khan is anything but aam, and there is very little of a people's movement in Jai Ho. It is a one man mission after all. Jai Ho.Jai takes quite a lot of damage it seems- stabbed, shot, bloodied, beaten black and blue, but then in a matter of seconds he proves that he is Salman Khan after all, when he tears off his shirt, and along with it disappears a knife that was apparently plunged deep in his back. The ludicrity reaches a whole new level when Sunil Shetty rolls in on a tank as Salman's wingman. Towards the end, all that Salman doesn't do is to don the chief minister's cap on his head. But that right belongs to another aam aadmi leader, right?The dialogs are straight off a b grade TV serial, and the music jarring. Tabu and Danny lend a touch of class to an otherwise special appearance filled proceedings. Either the khans were flush with funds, or appearing in a Sallu movie is a major draw- anyone and everyone of Bollywood, including out of work actors such as Aditya Pancholi, Mohnish Bahl, Nauheed Cyrusi, Vatsal Seth, Ashmit Patel, Varun Badola, Yash Tonk appear in bit roles. Daisy Shah may be a Rani Mukherjee look alike but is the inconsequential sallu heroine. Even though she is in the pink of health (pun intended), and puts and dances as well as any, with zero screen presence, and screechy acting skills, we may have seen the last of her. Nukkad's Khopdi features here too, probably playing Khopdi- the drunk. Talk about stereotypes .Can one person make a difference? The original plot is based on Mimi Ledger's excellent 2000 flick, Pay it Forward. Released on the eve of Republic Day, Jai Ho had the potential to be inspiring, pity though in the hands of a myopic director, it descends into a standard mas-ala movie with song, dance, cheap comedy and action.",negative
Jai Ho,"""Jai Ho"" is a Remake of Telugu Film STALIN .. Before this Salman has done successful Remakes as Wanted, Ready And Bodyguard which were exceptional Blockbusters in Bollywood.. Jai Ho is a complete Bonus Bonanza for Salman Fans because till now only the Fans witnessed a Heroic and ""A Larger than Life"" Image of their superstar but ""Jai HO"" is an amalgamation of a great Story with - Drama, Comedy , Action and moreover, A Noble Message, ""If you'd like to Thank someone don't just say thanks, instead Help 3 People and ask those 3 people to Help more 3 People... Genuinely when u'll come out of Theatres after Watching this Movie this message would have been created an Impact in your Minds.. Not only Salman is seen as a Action Hero but also as a Sensible Person who Helps People suffering in Pain.. Sometimes he'll make you Emotional through his touching performance .. The Story revolves around Jai (Salman)an ex Army officer who believes in honest living and not giving in to injustice. Helping those in trouble eventually lands Jai and his family in trouble when he takes on the might of a powerful Minister (Danny Denzongpa). While on one hand, Jai is engrossed in fighting the evil force, on the other, he conceives a novel idea that could have the potential to stir a revolution – help three people and ask them to help three people in return.How that simple idea changes everything for Jai is what the rest of the film is about. The film is a family entertainer which gives us hope for a better future. For those who have a lot of love for Bollywood and cinema in their bosom, should not miss out on this one. The film opens and closes with a moral – ""Thank you mat kahiye instead teen logo ki madad ki jiye aap"". Let's hope this film initiates a ""Thank You Chain"" and creates a history!",positive

Found a Treasure Called Love,"I almost didn't watch this movie due to the repetitive negative reviews here on IMDb. Usually I find reviews here fairly spot-on. But in this case I am convinced we are living in a generation of viewers who have been raised on so much schlock, sex, violence, blood and foul language that they wouldn't recognize a prime movie if it whacked them with a hammer. Either that or we have a set of the most bogus witch-hunt reviews ever. I could count the number of films I would give 10 stars and still have some toes left. This film has everything-- terrific cinematography, good acting (yes, a little hokey in places: intentionally so), a script that if one has a heart at all should bring tears to the eyes repeatedly, humorous moments, fun moments, bad decisions, sacrifice, redemption, hundreds of supporting actors, the most incredibly huge set I have ever seen in any film (they built an entire palace!) -- as well as the full gamut of drama mixed with comedy, music and dance.Many others have discussed the merits of the movie itself; they have done well enough that I don't have to re-hash. What I will focus on is the incredible number of negative reviews present here. We notice a large number of the reviews are similar or identical in writing style. That stands out very clearly-- which is highly suspect. Secondly, a large number of those reviews claim to be written from differing cities in India, yet are all in perfect, pristine English. ""Most boring movie I've ever seen."" We see this phrase repeatedly, in almost identical words. There are too many people giving this 7+ stars and even 10 stars (unusual to see on IMDb) to believe the legitimacy of the number of 1-star ""worst movie ever"" reviews. Such paradox is simply difficult to accept as valid. All I know is I'm in the U.S., I and my sister watched the movie together, and we both loved it. I can be very critical of films and for sure I have seen some real stinkers in my day-- but this movie definitely is not one of them. This has song, dance, a delightful story... and touches the heart more than once. Have your hanky ready. Please, feel free to consider the negative reviews as suspect (at the very least)-- and give this film a try. The best and most valid review is your own.",positive
Hasee Toh Phasee,Though i get what style this film was going for but the director lost sight of the theme. Though I get the rules he was trying to break...he wasn't consistently breaking them. Also the whole manic pixie dream character was so irritating and poorly directed. She had no real depth to her character and every time she bit her lip to display her quirkyness or whatever I straight up wanted to punch her in the face. I can't believe how annoying her character was and straight up not believable but a caricature. This seems like a big budget film so frikin do better.,negative
Hasee Toh Phasee,"Before I get on with the review, let me tell you I'm not a hardcore Parineeti fan. Just like I'm not Kareena's fan even though Jab We Met is in my top 5 list. I went in to watch Hasee to Phasee casually without any expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised. I found the movie to be superb! From a critics point of view, this movie has nothing new to offer. In fact, you can complain about many things. But this is one movie, where I beg to differ with the critics. Even though I have seen such movies plenty of times, I couldn't help myself from loving Parineeti's character. And needless to say, nobody but Parineeti could have brought the character to life.Aggressive, Submissive and Whacky! Parineeti's character Meeta has so many shades, you couldn't tell what she'd do next. The only thing I didn't like was : hero falling head over heals for a girl he met just a week back. Maybe they could have given more time for their relation to mature. But that doesn't stop me from LOVING each and every bit of the movie. Like the sequence where the heroine casually asks her sister's fiancé to marry her. Or, the ""locked in the room"" sequence where Parineeti gives an excellent performance.I couldn't give much credit to Adah Sharma for acting. Having said that, she is also extremely gorgeous. I'd definitely like to see her in more movies. Chemistry between the lead actors is quite sparkling, and I was quite satisfied with how the things turned out.I'll be heading to the theater soon to watch this movie again. This movie is definitely going to be in my Top 10 list.",positive
Thani Oruvan,"A well enacted thriller with a racy screen play portrays the war between the good and the bad (evil). Jayam Ravi's brother Director M.Raja has given so many hits but most of them would be remakes of success films in Telugu. This time he has took quite time to pen his story and screenplay after his last venture Velayudham starting Vijay which has worked quite well even though the basic concept is the same cat and mouse game. Corruption, Corporate mafia, underworld, Pharmaceutical Company's illegal research, Goons, Strict and straight forward IAS, IPS officers working with anti corruption motto, realistic fight with corporate Dons, A Solo Hero with a vision and a supportive lead lady some of the keywords that can describe this movie's plot. The ultimate show stopper of the movie was the performance of the antagonist played by none other than the yester year's charming hero Aravind Samy. He plays Siddharth Abimanyu a suave middle aged notorious scientist and has lifted the role to a different level with his charisma in a sophisticated set up. His comeback as a good hearted priest didn't work out in Kadal but sure this negative role will be a break through character in his career. Mithran (essayed by Jayam ravi ) is the best cop ever who shadows his aim case and moves exactly with his supporting team of friends. Mahima (played by the beautiful dusky Nayantara) who is head over heels with Mithran supports him with her skills. The overall love sequences seemed sensible and mature didn't bore us with instant dream sequences except the one and only song which was bearable. Other than these leads we have Nasser, Thambi Rammaiah (don't know how many movies he will play the same innocent character with the same tone), Vamsi Krishna, Ganesh Venkat Ram, Jay Prakash, Mugdha Godse (of the Hindi movie Fashion fame). On the technical bit like cinematography, editing, BGM, Arts was in place and gave what was needed for a script like this. Except a bit on editing would have made it look perfect. At times it would make you feel and compare portions with Kakha kakha and similar cop movie series, plus Ramana, Nimirndhu nil, E, Thupakki etc Verdict: A good thriller with an over shadowed antagonist which is the current trend where villain takes over easily.",negative
Thani Oruvan,"The movie title itself gave me goose bumps. A thriller is expected after all the promotions. But a thriller with a true meaning and less illogicalstuffs is Thani oruvan. The twist in the beginning scene itself will make you understand what you will watch for the next 2 hours. More than Ravi his brother deserves the applause for scripting something original and keeping the audience thrilled till the end. That's something very rare. But he managed to do that in this flick. But the next main person who should be saluted,awarded,appreciated,loved,and of course all the other synonyms is Aravind Swamy. Can a villain be so loved by everyone?. I think that has happened now. Performance to a next level. Ravi has done a commendable job in first choosing such a script which has more importance to the villain than the hero. And of course at the end everyone will appreciate the only performance which stands out that is Sidharth Abimanyu. An enjoyable ride. I am sure all will love it...",positive

In its satiric way, the movie is full of rich characters and plausible situations even if sometimes you can spot the cliché around the corner. Sometimes satire works as a magnifying glass to expose and better criticize something. Arshad unquestionably steals the movie with another over-the-top performance as the lawyer willing to risk everything. Superb performances by all. Special mention has to go to Boman n Saurabh Shukla. If u like court/lawyer movie, give this one a chance. This movie is an expose of the corruption, politics, and general crookedness of the legal profession. The movie does a good job of portraying both the human and systemic flaws of the legal system. Moreover, the movie balances between comedy n drama. Was highly anticipating a sequel. But lost all the zest once I read that Arshad is not part of the sequel. That is y I felt the need to write a review of this good movie even if it's very late. The only drawback was the romance angle n songs. But nonetheless, an awesome film.",positive
Pek Yakinda,"actually this movie really disappointed me because i wasn't expecting worst but now i can easily say for cem yilmaz he has to stop making a movie and he has to focus on doing a stand-up. he is not a good actor or director, basically he can not do couple of different job like you can not be a doctor, lawyer or police at the same time! if you can not handle it then stop doing it. DO NOT BE MONEY HUNGRY. just came from istanbul to new york and i couldn't stop my self to writing a review for this movie. i wish it's was better then what i saw but it s not.i watched this movie because of cast thats all i can say hopefully all crew and cast they will read this review and stop working with him but end of the day they have to earn money as well this is not an art anymore this is about money.",negative
Pek Yakinda,"Let me start by saying this movie is pretty darn good. Good acting, amazing cast, and the best of all are those tiny details that make you chuckle. This movie is by no means is just a run off the mill cheap comedy or a stand-up show.Watch it and pay attention to details.. You will at least like it if not truly enjoy it. Especially if you grew up in Turkey and know the ""Yesilcam"" culture. I loved all the references made those movies we all watched and loved as kids. Some of the reviews I read on this site was really unfortunate. I couldn't help but notice most of the bad reviews was also written in not so good English. Not trying to be mean or anything but please; just stop!!! (Not ""Green Pine"" like some idiot said. Seriously??? Do you call Hollywood ""Kutsal Odun""?) What's with you people? Anyway, bottom line is; I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend everyone to watch it. Keep up the good work Cem :)",positive
Rosewater,"This film is a disaster. The narrative is scrambled....sometimes schmaltzy, sometimes lost, sometimes both. Note to writers and director: humans don't talk like this. Characters are all either one- dimensional or no-dimensional. Camera-work...seriously? Every 5 minutes there's a shot out of focus, and another that focuses on something completely irrelevant. It's a real shame, because there's a wonderful story to be told here, but not by this cartoonish treatment. In the real world, people don't walk around with either a halo or a black cloud over them---in this 'video' they do. May as well have them actually wear black and white hats, does the filmmaker really think his audience is this stupid? (hey, maybe he's right). If submitted by a high school film student, this is a solid B-. Don't waste your money, wait for NetFlix then avoid it.",negative
Rosewater,"John Stewart does an outstanding job skillfully portraying an incredible journey by a western journalist caught in the Iranian post-election revolt. a must-see thriller. The acting is captivating, and the sets are truly realistic as they filmed in the middle east. Definitely a work that will not be forgotten. This movie is particularly relevant with the current prosecution of journalists in Ukraine and the middle east. The audience is thrown into the riot environment with the amazing work of the directors. Jon Stewart does a great job. The actor playing Maziar is truly captivating. It is great to see an original film that captures some of the problems of our generation. Will look forward to Stewart's future works.",positive
Saala Khadoos,"Sports film are a niche genre in India, and when we talk about boxing, then there is only a few films ever made on the sport. In recent times Mary Kom was a boxing film that made the cash registers ring, however I wasn't a huge fan of the film(while most of India was going gaga for the film). However with this weeks release Saala Khadoos, I can't say the same. Thats because Sale Khadoos is an endearing, heartwarming , and inspirational film. The film even promotes women boxing. Coming from the Raj Kumar Hirani stable (he produced it) one can also see the great social message a film like 3 Idiots, Munna Bhai gave in a film like Saala Khadoos, this Bi-Lingual (Hindi and Tamil) film is destined to win the hearts of its audience, but to a certain extent. While the former films mentioned were classics, Saala Khadoos is far from being in that league, as things such as predictability, being over melo dramatic bog the film down. However when watching the leads Madhavan and Ritika Singh perform one feels goosebumps from there awe inspiring acts. But more on that later.Story wise Adi Tomar had a dream to win the boxing gold for India. Instead, he languished in a nightmare for a decade after his gloves were spiked during a match by his own coach, blinding him in the arena and handing the match to his undeserving opponent. Shattered by his loss, Adi turned to a life of cynical self-destruction. Loyal friends somehow bring him back to boxing as the coach of the low-rated Indian women's boxing team. Adi continues to dream - this time for a fiery young woman. Adi spots in her a champion. So begins a partnership between a man who loves his sport and a girl who loves her freedom. It is the beginning of a beautiful friendship and a journey towards an impossible dream.Acting wise Madhavan gives his career best act as the crazy, angry boxing coach. One can feel his pain and anguish in the film, Maddy has lived the role, and this can be seen in the climax scene when he is fighting his way into the arena, and coaching Madhi from far away. When he says ""Merri Muhammad Ali"", its a tear jerking, great cinematic moment. Ritika Singh performance is a revelation, her raw energy makes her act so believable.She is a talent to lookout for, and she has the best debut awards already locked for next years awards. Nassar is good, and Zakir Hussain plays the clichéd villain but is still menacing. Saala Khadoos is everything a sports film should be the story is endearing, one feels for the characters, its inspirational because its a story of an underdog, its heartwarming because the girl is from a poor family, and the film has great social message of promoting women in boxing. The film even goes into the nitty gritty and talks about boxing and the politics, the sexual exploitation that come with the game. The director Sudha Kongara Prasad must be applauded for making a detailed, good movie on boxing in India, one can see the great effort. Even the films runtime at 1hr 50 min is perfect as the film never lags, its very fast paced and right to the point, however the film still has its negatives. Saala Khadoos is a very predictable film,from when the film starts till the end you knows going to happen, especially if you have seen the trailer. The film also is way too melo dramatic, and at any given moment someone is yelling, crying, and even falling in love. There is no normalcy at times.The whole love track was also not needed.Maybe the director tried to commercialize the film, which is not a good idea for a realistic boxing film. And for a film about a underdog in sports, the film has no novelty, the story gives a deja vu film because a story like this has been seen many times on screen.However all minuses withstanding, what makes one forget any negatives are the films leads chemistry which is absolutely lethal. The coach and boxer, act like fish to water together, together on screen the are just so entertaining to watch together. There bickering, and battering is hilarious, Like they said in the film one is mental, and one is full of anger lets see what happens.Amazing happens. The films action scenes are also to be applauded because they are very realistic, and well choreographed especially the climax action sequence which is a goosebumps inducing fight. Technical aspect wise the production values, the way the film is shot is all very average. The films music is good with the title track being the best.Overall Saala Khadoos is a good watch, and what makes the film a above average watch is Madhavan's and Ritika Singh's performance together they light the screen on fire. Its a honest attempt at highlighting and presenting a good story that should be told.3.25/5* or 6.5/10",negative
Saala Khadoos,"Complaint about this movie is that the story is predictable. Yes. Even Airlift movie's story is predictable. And in case of sports based film there's mostly the same story line. ""A coach/player will lose and eventually win themselves or make someone win at the end"". It's the screenplay which makes the difference here!! Screenplay - No-nonsense and straight to the point. It deals with the characters' screen time perfect. Nothing more. Nothing less. Direction - Narration by the director is really good. Not fast paced. But well paced. Director had brought the things required for the film very well . Be it the acting or the environment.Acting - Ritika Singh steals the show. There aren't words to describe her performance. Only when watching the film we realize. Madhavan as usual sticks to the character and performed just perfect!! A live example for versatile acting. Other supporting characters contribute their best. Only con is that some unknown faces don't make us feel emotional at times.Music - Soundtrack of the film as audio doesn't bring much. But when combined with the frames of the film creates magic!! Santhosh Narayanan has given one of his best works.There are many moments in the film where the wit of the director is highlighted - be it the jokes or the twists or social issue, they have been blended in the picture smooth.Watch it for Ritika Singh, Madhavan, Sudha, Santhosh Narayanan!!",positive
Mardaani,"Nowadays when the so-called superstars of bollywood (Salman, Akshay, SRK etc) make such mindless & nonsensical movies in the name of leave-your- brains-at-home comedies (like Kick & Ready & Dabang & Entertainment & what not), Mardaani is a refreshing change. I am not saying that it's a gem or the best movie out there but it is good. It has a good (although not many twists or turns) story, powerful acting by Rani and the supporting cast, no out-of-context songs and very nice ending.I see a trend that Bollywood heroines are trying to come up with good movies like Kangana in Queen, Revolver Rani; Priyanka in Mary Kom, Fashion; Vidya in Kahani, No one killed Jessica etc where as the 40+ year old ""heroes"" are still stuck in the 90s; churning out stupid movies where the girl is mainly for songs. I don't have a problem with those kind of movies too if they are decent; which many aren't. I love a good comedy or action movie as much as I enjoy a serious one. But the movies made by the male ""superstars"" are not even funny or entertaining; though surprisingly, those movies are in the 200 crore etc club.I hope we as an audience start to appreciate some diversity that movies like Mardaani portray.",negative
Mardaani,"Mardaani is a movie that despite an unimaginative plot and predictable narrative engrosses you in its fabric. Rani Mukerji is pitch perfect in the role of a super-cop that is rightly hued, far from the floss and swagger of Chulbul Pandey and Singham. She is real, gritty and every bit brilliant. Though the film's climax loses itself in melodrama, this is a film that has its heart in the right place and tells a pertinent story at a time when it must be heard.Rani Mukerji with no make up, stern face maintains her strong demeanor. The actress is non dramatic on purpose and that did the trick for me. She is far from the pomp and show of masala cop films and that subtlety blows your mind. I am ecstatic that the lady has returned in a role that does justice to her caliber.Tahir Bhasin is a revelation and quite interestingly lives up to Rani's stature. The chase between him and Rani is built brilliantly mostly because of his conviction in rendering such brilliance to his character. His diction and twang both blend in well drawing one's attention even further.",positive
The Trip to Italy,"Could only be called two idiots abroad. Calculated 'rambles' and cringe-inducing dialogue of nothingness. Full screen filled with their fairly boring faces while frustratingly, Italy, in all its green and aromatic glory is reduced to playing a background fleeting extra. Beautiful food is given a brisk token summary of a Benidorm-type review, while unbearable fractured Italian and pompous guide-book knowledge makes one wish their inflated boat would sink immediately with their over-inflated egos.An arrogant treatment of Italy, combined with the most pathetic belief that these two have anything interesting to say, will leave you searching for Italian for 'where is a Borgia when you need one?""",negative
The Trip to Italy,"Wonderful film that gets better every time I watch it. Touching, poignant and hilarious. Puzzled by spate of poor IMDb reviews but suspect that some Cougan fans might not be familiar with the persona he plays in this film: a self obsessed, angst ridden clinging to Hollywood star called Steve Cougan. Or maybe they just like Jason Statham movies, which this is not. I love the locations, the gentle but ridiculous plot twists around Brydon, the anecdotes of Byron and Shelley, chats on ageing, air of melancholia at the end of each episode and the hilarious attempts to out do each other on vocal imitations of stars of yesteryear. I loved The Trip and I love The Trip to Italy. Don't expect action, just sit back, indulge and enjoy.",positive
N.H 10,"Thrillers are like mathematics question, either you get maximum marks or you get zero, there is no scope of pass mark. Screenplay is very kiddies. When they want to add gun in plot, they shown that the male protagonist is very close to Delhi DIG, so he gets easily a gun license but when it comes to their rescue, even after informing the DIG, Police didn't even tried to find out, which is very easy if one has close of a DIG, state doesn't matter. A DIG have enough power to influence any other state Police. If DIG called back and the person couldn't pick the phone, it was enough to make him suspicious, he can easily find out the location and send the help. A person, who is clearly unaware of the village streets but chases the hard seasoned goons in a SUV where goons are aware of every corner of streets but they run for saving their life, Even they know that her only strength is SUV, she is not physically strong, then why did not they try to trap the vehicle in a narrow street!? This type of scene, only a person can conceive who have never visited a village. Fact, running a SUV freely in every corner of a village street is not possible and goons could have hide anywhere and trapped the person because reversing s SUV in streets is almost impossible. Even standing in a corner can save you from SUV and force that person to come out from the vehicle. There is musical program in village but after so much chasing and drama there is not a single person in village!? This musical program was stuffed for showing the village deserted. In introduction scene it's very clear that goons are ruthless but protagonist tried to chase them without any planning and that also just for threaten them with the help of gun!? Why did the person going for honor killing take along a mental retarded person, just for stuffing some thrill!? It is height of naiveness in screenplay. They show in a shot that it is full moon but took this fact for granted in lighting. Every frame is almost bright light. Performance wise Anushka Sharma is just for shouting and limping. Rest are just OK. One love track is melodious.",negative
N.H 10,"First, let me say I am NOT Indian, but I have watched Bollywood movies for over 10 years--a lot of them. Next, let me say that last year I saw 92 (yes, 92) movies in the cinema--that's not counting movies on DVD or on TV.NowNH10 is the BEST movie I have seen of all the movies I saw last year and so far this year.I think the comments about it being copied from Eden Lake (which I've not seen) or other movies in this genre might be true to some extent, but that's not fair. Shakespeare copied a lot of his plots from Boccaccio's Decameron. So what? So there have been a lot of other movies about a gang terrorizing a couple? So what? It's how you do it that counts. It's like a football play (American!)--you can have 100 teams run the same play, but one team does it best, and they win. NH10 wins.Yes, you knew something bad was going to happenbut when? How? To whom? And the false leads at the beginning of the film kept me in suspense. Of COURSE Arjun was an idiot-- that's the formula of these types of movies. If everyone were alert and smart, you wouldn't have a good horror movie! But I have to say I almost yelled at the screen, ""No, you idiot, don't leave your gun in the car!"" It's all in the execution.Anushka is one of my favorites, I have to admit. She always plays the strong woman, and Meera was certainly a strong woman. To be the center of the movie and on screen for almost every minute is quite an achievement, and she did it beautifully. It took a lot of skill to keep the suspense up throughout the movie, but it succeeded. There was really no way to tell until the last few minutes how it would all end--it could have gone several different directions.Also I have to applaud the director--and Anushka the producer--for leaving the studio and going out into real world. The Italians discovered this c. 1960, and Indian films would be much better if more of them did it. I know there are difficulties in filming in a crowded city, but there are ways",positive
Dum Laga Ke Haisha,"Prem (Ayushmann Khurrana) is persuaded by his family to marry for financial reasons to an overweight woman he doesn't find attractive. His new wife, Sandhya (Bhumi Pednekar ) is an educated woman who tries to make her marriage work, but Prem has no interest in so doing. They are persuaded to take part in the ""Dum Lagao"" contest, where the husband carries his wife on his back through an obstacle course, in so doing they reconcile.The premise of this movie is fantastic, but it just doesn't deliver. There is very little character development, less happiness, and an ending that is too sudden and not credible. Khurrana, who is too old for the role, wears a scowl the entire movie and plays his part one- dimensionally. Pednekar, in her first movie, is fantastic, giving depth to Sandhya, portraying believable emotions, and acting nearly flawlessly. Her performance is so good that she nearly saves the movie, but not quite.",negative
Dum Laga Ke Haisha,"DLKH brings the much needed freshness in Bollywood romance movies. And it comes with a very strong message woven around a very sweet love story. The direction is impeccable with moderated melodrama. Ayushmann Khurrana might never get the stardom like the Khans and the Kapoors but he is definitely one of those actors never afraid of doing path breaking movies and top them up with amazing natural acting - be it comedy or drama. But he gets a good competition from the new girl Bhumi Padnekar who delivers a very good performance, depicting a struggle of a fat girl in a white skin - size zero obsessed society of India. Sanjay Mishra, playing the role of Ayushmann's father, gives a memorable performance with really good dialog delivery topped up with brilliant comic timing. The length of the movie is unusually short for a Bollywood movie but then quality is always more important than quantity. Overall, for someone in a mood to watch a light romantic movie, your search ends at DLKH. This movie comes easily into the list of ""movies I can watch anytime"".",positive
Lucia,"Had planned to watch this multiple times, but finally was able to do so, along with 5 other audience members this morning in the sole multiplex this one's playing at, in the city of Bengaluru. 2 of them walked out a little after the interval. One of the people I met last night, on coming to know I planned to watch this, said it was too boring and confusing, and had to be re-watched 2-3 times in order to understand. He also mentioned that the entire movie was shot using a mobile phone camera.The reviews have been focusing on 2 aspects, 1 more than the other, which is the crowd funded nature of this endeavor. The other being the fact that this is very similar to various other movies in the mind&*^) genre, including Memento, Inception, Machinist, Donnie Darko et al.I had not seen this director's earlier work. All I had were the above intros. I was also worried that I'd have a problem understanding the movie, considering 2 things - 1, being I don't speak the language, and 2, I had a similar problem with a Malayalam movie last week, which did not have subtitles, but which I understood better, and which also had a significant portion of its narrative in other languages I understood like English, Hindi and Tamil.At various points while watching this one, esp. the spectacularly mind-bending and spell-binding climax, I was totally bowled over, and thought that everything that has been spoken of this magnificent piece of work has been cruelly unfair to the screenplay, and the finished product. Forget the fact that it was crowd-funded, forget the fact that there are @$$4013$ in the audience that walk out/find this boring (let them lap up the drudgery of Bollywood/Sandalwood/Tollywood/Mollywood. Let them dream of those lives. This is Not art-house cinema for the pretentious. This is pure commercial cinema (sample the 5 songs, that Do NOT clutter/interrupt the smooth narrative) with all the bells/whistles in place (the right place, that is). But, it is intelligent commercial cinema, that demands nothing but attention from the viewer. Most movies have made me cynical/jaded from appreciating the assembly- line output, but movies like this, and Shahid-Lunchbox-xxxx re-affirm my faith in making that trek to the multiplex, and doling out hard-earned money to watch masterpieces such as this. I'm absolutely gonna watch it again (it Has subtitles too, btw), purchase the Blu/DVD when that releases, and purchase the music CD of its songs (though I enjoyed the 1st one only). And oh, lest I forget, everything's just about perfect - the score, the casting and the performances (all), the cinematography, locations yada yada yada..... Pawan Kumar's voice has Got to be heard, and I'm all ears for keeps. Do Not Miss it on the big screen.",negative
Lucia,"#Lucia - People who have watched #Inception are saying that Lucia is India's own Inception but I say ' there is only one Lucia in the whole world and it is original '. Inception was about ' a dream within a dream ' but Lucia is about ' lucid dreaming ' so there is no way that these both EPIC movies can be weighed on the same scale because it would seem a stubborn act. #PawanKumar is a man who stands in a league where #ChristopherNolan #StevenSpielberg etc stand, for me. Even if you want to try finding flaws in this movie it is 'Mission Impossible', Pawan Kumar should be an inspiration to the whole industry, he has come out of the box of the age old Indian movie formulas and has done a film that stands unique in the whole world (at least what I know of). You reach out for the characters in the movie and that is something great. He makes the people think, 'what you think is a dream is actually a reality but what you think is reality is actually a dream'. You will be 'Mind Fu..ed'. Pawan Kumar, he with his film and his team need to be nominated to the #OSCARS (am not here to over exaggerate). No wonder it won an award at The London Indian film festival. Cinematography by #SiddharthNuni needs a special mention, shot in a 5d camera, he has made an already classic script into a masterpiece movie on screen. He captures every emotions in its own shade. #PoornaChandraTejaswi the music director is a true find and is a bright prospect to the Kannada industry. He delivers justice through songs and lifts the movie to another level through his BGM which is apt to each and every scene. #NeenasamSatish - now who would have ever thought he had such wide range of emotions hidden in him as an actor? The emotions that he portrays as a normal torch guy or the way he carries the attitude of a film star is mind blowing. #ShrutiHariharan the heroine is convincing and has delivered justice to her role. #AchyuthKumar as the owner of the theater which doesn't see audience or as the manager of a film star is flawless, a true actor. Editing - don't really know him it is but gives you the feel of a Hollywood film with his cut and paste work. It goes razor sharp transporting the movie at a brisk pace so that it doesn't bore you anywhere and yet keeps the suspense going along. Now all said and done about the movie, I am gonna talk as a Kannadiga now - Saw some page today posting watch Lucia at your own risk and I like to rephrase it saying ' miss Lucia at your own risk '. ' The movie is strictly not for fools '. People who hate Kannada movies take this..!.. Finally thanks to the audience who produced this movie. Lucia - an evergreen movie . . . Lucia isn't actually a person if you think it is but it is something else, if you wanna know it watch the movie at a theater . . . The only film where I saw people clap after it ended was #Avatar after that it is only Lucia . . .",positive

2 States,"As a person brought up in a family with 2 states culture IRL this is just a cheap mockery of exaggerated stereotypes in a loud nonsensical lengthy Bollywood movie. Could not even get through the book but was hopeful at least the movie would do justice to the best kind of love stories in India. The real life issues of reactions of different family members, difference in opinions, some compromises in traditional value, concerns of extended family and how they come about to achieve a middle ground none of which was depicted in a proper way. It was borderline racist sometimes without being apologetic even when there was absolutely no requirement for scenes like that. And no, that never increased the humor quotient of the movie which was already as low as their standards. To summarize, it was as if a Hollywood romcom was made about interracial marriages where the family of the whites gifts fired chicken to the blacks and the blacks would get them all some guns as gifts because they are from Texas.",negative
2 States,"We all are quite familiar with movies which are based on novels, real- life stories, autobiographies etc. but few films exist which strikes the right chord! Many movies (in Bollywood) like 3 Idiots (2009), Kai Po Che (2013) have been adapted from novels of one masterpiece: Chetan Bhagat! He is the main reason behind the success of these movies and many others and again for the latest release of his novel ""2 States"" adaptation in Bollywood!! This movie is so wonderful and doesn't require any action scenes, over-the-top dialogues, old-typical themes etc. but the makers have given a remarkable effort with some minor changes as compared to the book!! So here we go:Story: The story is beautifully crafted!! 2 people of different culture, different states fall in love with each other. But whether they know the consequences they would face when they would face the discomfort and the pressures when people talk of inter-caste liaison, the unyielding love and the resolve to win the parents' trust, each and every aspect with the emotions included! Will they succeed in convincing their parents to get married or will their relationship would get over is the main plot of this film.Cast: Arjun Kapoor as Krish Malhotra is delightful!! After films like Ishaqzaade (2012) and Gunday (2014) where he has a goofy character, he truly succeeds in playing a sweet, simple kind of a guy who gives importance to his relationships! He charms and gives a meticulous performance! One of his finest performance till date!Alia Bhatt as Ananya Subramanium is first-rate!! She is beautiful yet witty and gives a delightful performance as a Tamil-Brahmin girl!! Her chemistry with Arjun is electrifying! We can say that Alia has now became an evolved actress and she knows when to capture emotions at the right time!!Amrita Singh as Krish's Mother is a revelation! She truly is fantastic as the typical Punjabi mother-in-law who justifies her role!! She steals the show in most of the scenes!!Ronit Roy as Krish's Father is extraordinary!! He develops an antagonistic relationship with his son but he is remarkable!! Watch out for the twist that he would get in the 2nd half!Shiv Subramanium and Revathy as Ananya's Father and Mother gives decent performances!! They are quite efficient!!Direction: Director Abhishek Varman should deserve the Best Debut Director in next year's film awards! He truly strikes the right chord!! He gives an remarkable effort but capturing sweet melodramatic scenes and wonderful emotions which come during the course of the film!! Both he and Karan Johar (Producer) have wonderfully executed a delightful film!!Music: The music of the film is exceedingly well!! The songs truly move you and will put a smile in your face!! Songs like ""Locha-e-Ulfat"" and ""Offo"" are best numbers which will make you groove along with it! ""Mann Mast Magan"" is a wonderful and top-notch song that steals your heart!!On the whole, 2 States is one of those rare Hindi films which have came in a long time and had explored us the diverse cultures, melodramatic scenes, problems of inter-caste marriages but one thing knocks all of it: ""Love""! It really empowers on all of the dizzy situations!! Strongly recommended to people of all age-groups and also to those who fantasize about diverse people!!",positive
Rob the Mob,"I must say I liked the premise of the film and was intrigued that this was based on a true story. However, this movie failed for me because of a poorly written script. I agree with the reviewer who said the filmmakers really blew it when they didn't pivot the movie on the discovery of ""The List.""My Gripes Are As Follows:1) They had way too many make out scenes between Tommy and Rosie; 2) Every scene with the mafioso dragged on with terribly clichéd conversations; 3) Andy Garcia's scenes shouted ""I'm in this movie 'cuz I gotta pay for my son's college tuition.""; 4) Child actors should be banned from films-- Big Al's (Garcia's) grandson was jaw- droppingly pathetic; 5) Ray Romano has little gravitas as a dramatic actor; 6) I agree with the reviewer who said Andy Garcia looked more like a rabbi than a mob boss. That beard was downright distracting and totally out of character.I also agree with the reviewer who said that the film seriously lacked a musical score. Sadly, this has been a trend for many years in the filmmaking industry. There are just very few good musical scores out there.Did I mention this film had a lousy script?",negative

The arguments and points of view are quite interesting, with a caveat that in the end, perhaps who cares? There is a love story in the midst (and a friendship) that builds and begs to reach you emotionally with fine acting and directing. Character development arise seamlessly through three different age period and the pacing and editing are quite remarkably on cue.I don't want to reveal too much about this cerebral science fiction, but there are many clever surprises that awaits the engaged viewer both in the story twists and the underlying concepts explored.

Even though they know Hindi but accent is that of katrina kaif (lived throughout there life in India)A man catches fire but it is supposed to be funny.

I hope this film flops so that in future such shits are not made",negative
Tubelight,"""Worst movie ever..."", ""Don't waste your money..."", ""Salman Khan is not able to act...""... IMDb and more are filled with such reviews. Guys, what do you want to watch? Item numbers? Actress in skimpy outfits? Kissing scenes? Do you expect Action in a Drama movie? Tubelight is a beautiful drama/war movie. Its about strongly believing in what you want. And Salman Khan did a great job. My 5yo son, who was not so focused when watching Jungle Book, watched Tubelight from the start to the end. He had tears in the emotional part and agreed that he enjoyed. What else do we expect? Don't judge by online reviews. Watch the movie yourself!",positive

This movie is artistic, in terms of how clean shots are engaged with some classic background music, there are some scenes which comply with the BGM, so much so, it takes them to a completely different level. 3. It's all about ACTING, actors in this movie do pure justice to their roll , Specially Simhaa, he nailed the character , and definitely garners admiration from audience.

Holiday: A Soldier is Never Off Duty,"Holiday - A Solider Never Off Duty, an Akshay Kumar show all the way... On leave from the Indian Army, Virat Bakshi (Akshay Kumar) is bride hunting and meets Sahiba (Sonakshi Sinha). Along with his cop buddy (Sumeet Raghavan) he catches a terrorist who is part of a sleeper cell. From then on, he is engaged in a cat-and-mouse game with a terror mastermind (Freddy Daruwala).Firstly thank god Akshay Kumar has not done his stereotypical over the top comic act here. Akshay Kumar is probably one of the best action stars Bollywood has ever seen and he reminds us again why he is on the top of list. His character in Holiday is serious, smart, calm & composed. Somewhere in the film he reminded me of Special 26's Arjun. He steals each & every moment of the film. It's a treat to watch him in this avatar. It's difficult to imagine anyone else in the role. He sinks deep into the character of an army man. It feels like the role was tailor made for him. With this film he shows how versatile as an actor he is. I wish he chooses these types of roles over those so called ""entertaining"" & ""comic"" ones.Why on earth (read Bollywood) do we need a heroine in a film like this? Sonakshi Sinha is one big flaw in Holiday. She irritates the viewers at regular intervals just like Kajal Agarwal did in Special 26 or more than her. She is like those commercial breaks which come during a nail- bitting cricket match. The romantic track between her and Akshay Kumar & the songs could've easily been chopped off from the film. This would make Holiday more interesting to watch.Debutant Freddy Daruwala tries hard to be Vidyut Jamwal of Force but doesn't create much of an impact. Sumeet Raghavan plays his part perfectly. Govida's cameo was entertaining but was needless in the film. Despite there being several loopholes in the script director A.R. Murgadoss manages to keep the audiences glued to their seats throughout the movie excluding songs & the romantic angle. The film's story is nice especially the second hour. Also the film could've easily edited by 15- 20 minutes.The scene where Akshay Kumar rescues girl hostages is the highlight of the movie. A special mention for the action director Greg Powell for doing a wonderful job. I'll rate it 7/10. Holiday has flaws but is an enjoyable flick. Akshay Kumar takes the film to another level. Even non Akshay Kumar fans will love him in this avatar. Holiday A Soldier Never Off Duty is for both, classes & masses.",negative
Holiday: A Soldier is Never Off Duty,"Akshay Kumar is an amazing actor. His stunts are jaw breaking no doubt. But, the film hits the write notes. Sonakshi Sinha was wasted. Freddy Daruwala makes a god villain. This is an edge of the seat thrilled that will keep you hooked right till the end!It's just as hard to imagine ""Holiday"" without Akshay as it is to imagine last week's elegiac and thoughtful ""Citylights"" without Rajkummar Rao.They both breathe life into their characters from different respiratory systems.We often tend to think the grammar and language of mainstream cinema to be far easier to convey than the language of the so-called serious cinema.Wrong! A full-on massy product, which doesn't resort to outlandish inanities or outright vulgarity, is the most difficult form of filmmaking. In ""Holiday"", Murugadoss has some absolutely unflinching support from his writers and technicians, all out to create that increasingly elusive cinematic entity .The perfect entertainer.Not that ""Holiday"" is not without its flaws. What would life in the movies be without those?Sonakshi Sinha's role and presence in the plot can at best be termed as comic relief. She is less diva, more Mehmood. It is interesting to see how the director weaves the romantic element into what is predominantly a rugged man-to-man confrontation between an armyman on leave and a super-intelligent terrorist, who is seen to work out not from a dingy warehouse, but a normal home teeming with the scents and images of domestic harmony.",positive
The Clan,"I think Argentinians may enjoy this movie better than foreign audiences, judging from it's current score (7.0). Maybe it's because they're already familiar with the historical setting, story and characters. My guess is foreign audiences won't appreciate this movie so well -- I know I didn't. The plot is told in a very tedious way. We get to see kidnapping after kidnapping, with little to no emotion or conflict. Maybe it was the dull script, but no actor delivered good performances. Sure, some psychological conflict is hinted, but it never reaches the viewer in an honest or meaningful way. I also found it poorly directed, with a notable cringe-inducing and awkward scene paralleling one of the kidnappers having sex with his girlfriend and one of the victims being questioned. Skip this one and watch Nueve Reinas or El Secreto de sus Ojos instead.",negative
The Clan,"Few years after the dictatorship in Argentina by Rafael Videla is overthrown, the remaining members of that military order begin a life of crime, using as an excuse that the Argentinians sold the country and pushed the patriots into catastrophe. At this time in history, is where the story of Arquímides Puccio (Guillermo Franchella) and his family take place. Puccio is an old retired military who starts kidnapping rich youngsters not just for the money, but to satisfy an evil mind that wants suffering. However, his five children, Alejandro (Peter Lanzani), Maguila (Gastón Cocchiarale), Silvia (Giselle Motta), Adriana (Antonia Bengoechea) and Guillermo (Franco Masini), are the ones who end up with the biggest sorrow. This brilliant movie is not a conventional crime thriller, it also explores the psychological illness of all the members in this family caused by the oppressing voice of Puccio's patriarchy. Alejandro, the brilliant and successful eldest child, is the connection between us and the pain inside the characters. The narrative of the story begins by the end, and so it goes interchanging present and future, until they collide in a sublime climax when all the feelings and thoughts of the children explode. Each one of the characters, even though they were real, are so astoundingly designed that you can feel the hate of the father; the indifference of the mother; the rage, the fear and even the love of the children. Another remarkable aspect of this movie is the BSO, featuring an accurate selection between The Kinks, Credence Clearwater Revival, and Argentinian rock of the 80's like Seru Giran and Virus. This is also a portrait of the post-dictatorship era as a fictional interpretation of the feelings of an old retired military, his new war, and his new army: his family.",positive

Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2,"LoL the majority of average rating is coming from the feminist side i assume :D Well definitely the movie will give you a burst of laughter if you're a male and we were expecting exactly the same, the movie live to the hype of the PKPN1. In beginning i wasn't expecting it to stand any where near to its prequel but i'm glad that i was wrong.Though Thakur couldn't gel up as a replacement for Chaudhary, i personally feel the boys cast should be the same... missed the bonding of Rajjo, Liquid and Chaudhary but Chouka takes that place as a nice replacement package. Its a story that revolves around women's 1. the money minded.. 2. the best friend conscious.. and 3. girl concerned with family... the movie scenes were well shot and Anshul/Gogo monologue is longer, better and epic.I will agree to the fact that First half is more fun and dominant over the second but the story ends really well Talking to their mothers;)Don't listen to any1, if u r a fan of first PKPN you will definitely enjoy this movie without any disappointment, cheers!!",positive
Race 2,"There is no imagination, or rather stupid imagination all through the movie. The amount of money thrown around is obscene...for the first time a bollywood movie talks in billions of Euros. The special effects are childish, the premise and the so called twists are crazy. Its all about being glamorous, the script proves that no brains have been applied. I cant think of enough bad adjectives for this movie. I couldn't avoid watching it, but do yourselves a favor and stay away from it. I was feeling embarrassed watching it, the makers should have been ashamed. Lets take one example of the multitude in this movie. a car is fitted with a bomb that would burst if the speed is reduced. So Saif removes it while the car is doing 100+, but lo and behold, the bomb has no wiring connected to anything in the car. its just stuck there, he pulls it and throws it away. So how would it have tripped if the speed was reduced? Just one of the hundreds of examples of asinine non logics in this movie. Stay AWAY!!",negative
Race 2,"5 years ago , Abbas-Mustan directed Race set a new level in the thriller genre as far as bollywood is concerned....RACE-2 is no different...As a sequel to RACE i expected this movie to be highly suspenseful, twistful and action packed....which it indeed was.....but what it failed to do was distinguish itself from its prequel...the same kind of storyline, same twists, same type of characters and same scenes were cloned throughout the entire movie... the climax scene was very poorly and sadly executed....If u've watched RACE, you can easily predict certain part of the sequences and it makes you feel no different....But unlike RACE, apart from only planning and plotting, some action sequences have also been included and to my surprise, they have been executed to perfection....Along with action, cinematography and background score have been the most unique features of RACE-2...As far as the cast is concerned,there are average performances by JOHN, DEEPIKA and others, but its SAIF who steals all the way...JOHN would have done a far better in a negative role...but fails to impress much...Finally RACE-2 has all the contents to make it a good thriller film with unexpected twists, but it would have been much much better if the script would have different from its prequel....",positive
Premam,"Yes yes Nivin Pauly has acted well but more than that it was the director's vision which gave this movie its heart. The storyline is nothing new - a young carefree lad George falls in love for the first time and many times thereafter and how his outlook of the world changes with each lady love of his life. Alphonse Puthren gave a new life to the script with his impeccable cinematography and detailing. Each and every role is etched perfectly and acted with excellence. The roles played by the support actors as George's best friends tingle your heart because when their friend is heartbroken they cry with him too. After a very long time has a movie come where the emphasis is not on the family drama but on the adopted family that we get as our friends. The background score of the movie is excellent keeping up with the tempo of the movie frames. Though I felt there were a couple of unwanted scenes here and there but whole and whole it was a good entertainer. P.S.- Nivin Pauly looks stunning in that black shirt, mundu and those aviators..!! *sigh*",negative
Premam,"""What a way to refresh yourself.."" This is what came to my mind after watching this film. Being a great fan of the mastermind Alphonse Puthren and his debut film Neram, this didn't disappoint me. But it did impress me.It may not be a life-changing, mind-blowing film. But a clean romantic comedy that lies closer to reality than you think. Unintentional and situational comedy that shows up almost in every scene of the film, can clean your mind of any stress or anything of that sort that you have at the moment.The direction of the film as usual is exemplary. The edits (that too done by the director) certainly utilities the factor of directorial edited films. The film certainly lacks a story but that factor is hidden by the beautifully captured visuals thanks to the cinematographer, Anend. Screenplay is good. Production value and art was natural at it's level best as most of the places shown in the film originally exists.The film is divided into 3 acts that covers 3 stages of the life of George, a care-free living youngster - the first one covering the romantic relationship of George while studying in 12th grade is the shortest one of the film. The second covering his collage life is the longest and the most stylish\epic one among that, making it my favorite. The last act shows the life of George after his collage life, now a working class fellow. The film's main plot is based on 3 different women that George fell in love with during the 3 different stages.Simple and elegant plot which lags a bit in the last half hour is the only problem with the film that I saw.Positives :-1. Nivin Pauly himself is a great asset to the film. The film too should be a great asset to him as this film is the best work I saw from him. He has improved his weaknesses like acting out emotional scenes and dance. OMG, the wonderful dance choreographed by Sai Pallavi is amazing. And Nivin has danced it to perfection.2. All other male stars. When I say this I mainly mean none others that Krishna Sankar and Shabareesh Varma. Shabareesh does a kind of one man show which is my other favorite of the film. Being a lyricist and a singer, the actor have given all his level best performance at all areas. Vinay fort, Maniyanpilla Raju was also good. 3. All the three lead actresses were pretty good. Mostly Sai Pallavi who changed the entire course of the film with her cute performance as Malar miss smile emoticon4. Wonderful cameos. There are a lot of cameos throughout. First one being Jude Anthony as Jolly D' Cruz. Then there is Renji Panicker as David who did a stylish role with the superbly written dialogs from his own films. Finally there is the director himself as Ronnie who is a drug addict and the only or mainly the villain of the film.5. Superb stunt scenes. There is hardly 2 scenes of fights in the entire film and the main one in that being George's collage intro. I sure wished there was more of that frown emoticon6. Amazing cinematography and superb Edits.7. The best soundtrack I've ever heard along with Chandrettan Evideya and Neram.Negatives :-1. A little lag that happens the final half hour.Verdict - Premam is a surely must watch entertainer",positive
Tanu Weds Manu Returns,"Killed all the goodwill created by original Tanu weds Manu.Killed romance, killed innocence sweetness and respectful relationships.

Jassi turns from a gabru sardar to impotent wimp, payal from a sensible UP girl to evil housewife who hides from her husband that he is not really father of their baby.And wine and alcohol industries must have paid serious money to production house becoz they are promoting drinking like anything.

Rustom,"The film starts with introduction of Mumbai(was Bombay) in 1950's and then a Patriot and a naval Officer Commander Rustom Pavri. They show the love life of Rustom with his wife in the beginning. His life is drastically shook when Rustom comes to know that his wife has an affair with his close friend Vikram Makhija who is a Businessman and a Womanizer(Unknown to Rustom). He shots Vikram dead with 3 bullets in heart, in anger and himself surrenders to police. Vikram's sister cases against Rustom but when he is given benefit to live in Naval custody, he refuses. The media stands with Rustom as he was a honest solider and the public prosecutor and Vikram both were Sindhi while Rustom was Parsi. Then film slowly starts to take turn as offices from Navy search for some special documents in his house, and also by means of bribe. Then Rustom himself defends himself in the court, which is shown mind-blowing(Some comedy, some drama, etc.) After a span of witnesses, defenses, the affair description of Rustom's wife and finally Rustom's explanation to the jury that he shot Vikram in his self defense, when it is clear that he will win, the movie takes a BIG LEAP. The main investigating inspector comes with an audioclip where Rustom seems to be very angry on Vikram and wants to kill. But then the movie takes another turn when the inspector meets him personally. Then Rustom tells that there was a corruption going on in Indian Navy for an aircraft carrier deal, where classified Naval Officers, Vikram and even Defense Minister were involves. They wanted to buy an aircraft carrier that was a piece of junk where high profile corruption was going and Rustom was Inspection officer of that carrier. When Rustom refuses to take bribe from Vikram, his ego is hurt and decides to take revenge from him in the form of the affair. Rustom understands that when he is sent to 6 months assignment, then he bluffs about the documents of inspection of the carrier, and that's the reason he kills Vikram. But at the end he is released by the jury. THE FILM IS A MUST WATCH, ITS A GREAT MOVIE BUT 2 STARS LESS DUE TO SOME DIRECTION GLITCHES. DIRECTION IS GOOD BUT NOT UPTO THE MARK. THE INCIDENTS ARE SOME TIMES IRRELEVANT AND SOME JUMPS. EITHER AN EXCELLENT MOVIE TO WATCH.",negative
Rustom,"I watched Rustom when it aired on Zee TV last evening. I did not expect too much from it based on press reviews even though it had done well at the box office. Was I surprised!Even though everyone knows this movie is broadly based on the infamous Nanavaty incident, it was well made and riveting till the last scene.Everyone but everyone essayed their role so well, especially the bawaji newspaper walla :) Akshay could well pass off for aapro Russi!Rustom is one heck of a slick production, good plot, fabulous period sets, crisp dialogues, superb acting, cinematography par excellence.This movie holds the interest throughout and the climax keeps you on the edge of your chair even though you very well know what is coming.Well done Akshay, with Special 26, Holiday, Baby and now Rustom, you have really come well out of the Khiladi mould.

Chinese Puzzle,"The threequel to 'Pot Luck' and 'Russian Dolls', 'Chinese Puzzle' picks up the story of French writer Xavier (Romain Duris, engaging as ever). He's now married to Briton Wendy (Kelly Reilly), with whom he has two children. His Belgian lesbian chum Isabelle (Cécile De France) is obsessing about having children and Xavier agrees, against Wendy's wishes, to provide the sperm with which Isabelle will be artificially inseminated (who said romance was dead?) Meanwhile, Wendy meets an American and sets up home with him in New York, taking her and Xavier's children with her. Distraught at losing contact with the children, Xavier relocates to New York himself. But will he ever find lasting love?There are many things casually presented as acceptable here which some may take issue with (eg the self-indulgent, artificial creation of children in a time of over-population; visa-convenient marriages). But this film is so feel-good that even a grouch like me sat grinning - or laughing out loud - for much of it. Returning players Duris, De France and Audrey Tautou slip on their former roles with ease; Reilly's acting I found a bit too soap operaish. Of the new characters, Jason Kravits, as Duris' sleazy lawyer, does a fine comic turn. The film is pure entertainment - in fact, if it weren't for Xavier and Wendy's annoyingly precocious, wise-beyond-his-years son, it would be near perfect. But this is still another splendid chapter in Cédric Klapisch's romcom saga.",negative
Chinese Puzzle,"I haven't seen the two previous movies by the same director and actors preceding this one, but all by itself I loved this one. It is funny, witty, interesting and unusual. I understand the previous two movies portrayed the lives of characters at an earlier age. Now they are around 40 years of age, they are in NYC and they have different set of problems. I participated in a Q&A with the director at the end of the movie and I understand what he is trying to portray is a generation of people who are more mobile, who aren't afraid of mixing with different cultures, live in different countries, deal with the challenges presented by this new country. Movie has a very very positive, upbeat look at things. And it is very refreshing to have this positive outlook considering how many movies feeds of drama and difficulties almost to a degree, which makes them unrealistic. Life is not so bad and things don't go that bad in real life. You might get lucky at things. This movie has a positive, realistic look at life. I could easily relate to it. Loved it, highly recommend it. Especially if you want to laugh a bit and feel good about life. And there is nothing wrong with that.",positive
"Kumiko, The Treasure Hunter","Maybe I'm a little critical, but I wonder what motivates a filmmaker to make a film such as ""Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter."" Visually it's a very nice looking film, especially the scenes focusing on the bleak, American heartland. But story wise, I wonder, what's the point?""Kumiko"" is about a narcissistic, troubled Japanese woman who becomes obsessed with the film ""Fargo,"" and comes to believe that a large amount of money that's buried by a character in the film (played by a young Steve Buscemi), actually exists. So Kumiko decides to quit her job in Tokyo and travel to Fargo to find the ""buried treasure.""""Kumiko"" is actually based on the true story of Takako Tonishi, a Tokyo office worker who traveled to the cities of Bismarck, Fargo and finally Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, where she committed suicide after being depressed over the breakup with her former lover, an American businessman, who she had last seen in Detroit Lakes, on an earlier trip.The story that Takako was seeking the buried treasure from the ""Fargo"" movie developed from an urban legend that sprung up following a miscommunication that Takako had with a police officer from Bismarck, North Dakota. The officer misunderstood what Takako was trying to tell him and came to believe she was searching for the buried treasure from ""Fargo.""How then are we supposed to view ""Kumiko?"" Should she be viewed sympathetically as she must endure a demeaning boss, her nagging mother and scornful co-workers? Or is she simply a deluded simpleton who actually comes to believe ""Fargo"" is not a work of fiction? The climax perhaps gives us a hint as to where director David Zellner's sympathies lie: indeed, Kumiko does find the money from ""Fargo,"" but the implication is that it's all a fantasy—that she tragically died in the snow, pursuing a futile obsession.At best, ""Kumiko"" is the bullied child who chooses to live her life in a fantasy world. It's hard to have sympathy however, for such a sad sack, who cuts everyone off around her and risks death to obtain a pointless, materialistic goal.Zellner wins points for conveying the bleak environment of his protagonist but her one-note obsession could have easily been made as a 30 minute short.",negative
"Kumiko, The Treasure Hunter","This movie starts off as a quirky, pathetic character study but in the second half veers into a portrait of a mental breakdown. By the end, the main character is wandering around in the snow, hallucinating, ready to die. I think it would have been more consistent if they went with either the light, comic tone or the darker one. (If it was to be the former, they could have changed the story so that she just went on a holiday, rather than stealing the money to go.)The movie hit a highly affecting note about twice for me. Once when her boss asked her what her plan was and she couldn't answer. And again when she calls her mother for the second time in America and starts crying. But it was sort of too late by then, and the audience persisted in laughing at every little thing the quirky Japanese girl did that was vaguely funny. But it wasn't funny in the end, it was sad. And the ending didn't seem to fit. They needed to develop the plot more, but instead they cut often to sort of nice looking nature or urban documentary which wasn't really related. And the soundtrack was OK but not used well. It would swell into loud noise at various points, but nothing of a corresponding intensity would be happening on film. This might have worked for a mental breakdown movie. But like I said, half the time they are playing her dysfunction for laughs. I suppose a tragic ending would have been a bit underdeveloped considering the mental breakdown plot line was only really sprung on the audience in the last half hour. But the ending that is there... Well, I think the directors created this pathetic character who they relate to and then the ending is their way, through cinema, of reaching out to her and people like her, misfits. And that was kind of the way the film was advertised, even in a review I read, as a light ""power of film"" film. But the problem is the film had almost nothing to do with movies.Kumiko watches Fargo and that's it. She doesn't seem to be a big film fan. And she only watches it because she finds it, in probably the best scene, in a cave on the beach. So it is less about film than going crazy really, internalising a narrative from a film that is just reflecting suppressed subconscious urges anyway. Crucially, she believes the film is real, something a film fan would never do, no matter how much they wanted to. And as a film, this isn't a good of the craft. It's slow and has unnecessary stuff in it and the music isn't edited very meaningfully. And Kumiko hardly says anything the whole time. The actress' performance in the first half is a pretty good picture of social anxiety (more human than Naoko in Norwegian Wood, think) but in the second half she is reduced to saying ""Fargo, want go Fargo"" over and over. And the problem is it is not really a film about the love of film, because her need for it is pathological about this one film, and yet they obviously wanted to go someway in that direction so it doesn't make it as a film about mental breakdown or psychological escape either because the commitment to that side wasn't there. But yeah, props to the directors for effort, and evidently caring about humanity. In this movie they had hot coco and went to a Chinese restaurant with a buffet, which I really wanted to do after watching. There also seemed to be this little red riding hood theme running through it, but I couldn't say why.",positive

The D Train,"Dan Landsman has never been the cool guy, but that's about to change, if he can convince Oliver Lawless, the most popular guy from his high school who's now the face of a national Banana Boat ad campaign, to show up with him to their class reunion. A man on a mission, Dan travels from Pittsburgh to LA and spins a web of lies to recruit Lawless. But he gets more than he bargains for as the unpredictable Lawless proceeds to take over his home, career, and entire life........Jack Black has had one of the strangest careers in Hollywood for a once A-list star. The School Of Rock, in my opinion, was very mundane, but it rocketed him into the big time, and kudos to him, it opened many doors, and for a while, he was everywhere.But then he went down the Mike Myers route, and the biggest films he's done in the last ten years are about a talking panda. I always preferred him in a little Independent movie like Bernie, or as a supporting character (his turns in The Cable Guy and High Fidelity were scenes stealing turns).And let's not forget he played a wannabe 'Rastafarian' in I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.But here, he's really sank to a new low, and his career is now sitting comfortably with Cuba Gooding JRs as having the biggest career nose-dive in history.Dan is one of the most unlikable, selfish, insufferable characters a 'comedy' has ever seen. The man lies, cheats, steals, and ignores his sons needs in order for him to be popular for once, and you what? It's give me some sadistic pleasure when his world came crashing down around him.But what makes it worse is that he has such a nice family, and such a comfortable existence, so what if the rest of the alumni don't invite you for a drink, get over it, stop being bitter, and know your priorities in life.Things only go from bad to worse when Marsden 'enters' into the fray, the writers decide, for some reason, that Dan will do anything, literally anything to be popular and win the day.And then the film turns almost into a psycho obsessive movie, and Dan almost turns almost a Rupert Pupkin style personality change, because Lawless is doing what Dan should be doing, paying a little attention to his son.But don't worry, this films message is 'be a nasty person, be abhorrent towards the ones closest to you, because they are like dogs, their love is unconditional.It's truly one of the most nastiest, vilest, pieces if filth I've ever seen, and I really hope it vanishes without a trace.",negative
The D Train,"Many may not want to admit this, but ""D"" Train happens more often than not. This subject matter of a bromance gone to an awkward level is a welcome addition in a time where fluid sexuality is a pervasive theme within todays hot topics.

The film focuses on life's ups and downs of Dan (Jack Black) as he orchestrates a reunion with an old high school popular guy. To his surprise, the encounter turns fun until one night of drunken partying leads to a ""moment"" neither protagonist is soon to forget. Unfortunately for Dan, his constantly wanting to repress what happened leads him to deal awkwardly with those who surround him back in his small quiet hometown. On other hand, the film perfectly encapsulates the character of Oliver Lawless, a struggling actor who finds an opportunity to feel what its like to be wanted and adored with attention when his true life is less than what his image portrays. The scenarios that are taking place in this film are to be given credit and much consideration for they are truly deep seeded issues dealing with mens interaction with one another, masculinity and society's expectations. Oliver's arrival into town for the class reunion only worsens the situation as Dan becomes a walking time bomb. He's got mixed feeling about Oliver and does not know how to deal with it. So he has sudden outbursts of rage and anger as the film progresses into an abrupt final act for both men. The film succeeds in showing the inner struggles and emotional turmoil many men, Im sure, have endured in similar situations. I feel the filmmaker dealt with the subject matter in a realistic way for these situations tend to be naturally awkward to begin with. To sweep such raw feelings under the carpet can really take its toll if left unattended. I do recommend this film, not for being a comedy, even though some of the awkward moments did elicit a chuckle or two, but because there is depth here and very interesting ideas and themes that the film deals with simultaneously in a very fresh and original way. This may not be the comedy most will be expecting to see, but I suggest you give the film a chance. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the show!",positive
Simmba,"My original review which got more than 300 likes got deleted cos the fellas associated with this lousy film cannot digest opinions. IMDb is flooded with fanboys of lousy actors who cannot respect opinions.I never put spoilers, or abusive or irrelevant stuff.
This proves that IMDb of lately been hijacked by fake reviews.I can still copy paste my review which is saved but this time I jus want to write something different.
As a fan of Ajay Devgan, I am really shocked that he agreed to star in this pathetic film.
The overacting by the lead actor became an enduring torture to sit thru.
The script, direction, acting, editing n cinematography, r all worse than Ed Wood films.Massive narrative sinkholes, outstanding disbelief in the muddled writing and shockingly pathetic over acting. This film is a torture to sit thru n without a doubt the most inept and atrociously awful film ever made.",negative

Samba,"This movie about the trials of Samba, a Senegalese illegal immigrant's life in Paris is from the director and lead actor Omar Sy that brought us The Intouchables, and suffers from revisiting the fish out of water relationships that underpinned that earlier film less convincingly. I just couldn't swallow the attraction that brought Alice, a burned out recruitment executive and Samba together, and most of the other central characters such as Wilson (Tahar Rahim) were superficial or unbelievable. The best aspect was raising the issue of how western societies treat refugees and illegal migrants. But overall it lurched between slapstick and serious without the glue of characters one cared about to hold it together.",negative
Samba,"As some have noted before, it is a light-hearted movie on a serious topic (undocumented immigrants) but always respectful at that.I cannot quite agree with the reviewers that did not see the humor in this movie (I laughed about every three minutes throughout - expect towards the end - and sometimes even cried at the same time). Neither can I understand how people can say that the characters are flat or even ""boring"". Imho, the film succeeds in portraying them in not just black and white; each of them (and there are many!) evolves within the 120 minutes so much so that, in fact, it is not about the immigrants being the ""angels"" and the immigrant officers being the ""devils"" at all. On the contrary, lines are blurred very early on and especially in the end.I find that this is a worth successor of ""Untouchables""; I probably even prefer it. It is a very moving film (similar to the documentary ""l'Escale"") but without trying to be so. Also, the actors are brilliant! (Omar Sy, I think, even manages to mimic a Senegalese accent.)",positive
Big Bad Wolves,"You'd think a guy that had been kidnapped, abused, tortured would ask at least once: ""Why, why me? What reason do you have to suspect me?"" Not this one. Is he too proud? Or do they hire imbeciles to read Torah studies in Israel? I've no idea. I just know that this is NOT how people behave, this looks false. The pleas of this guy is not what you'd expect from a bewildered person in pain. It doesn't even matter if he's guilty or not. Whoever wrote the screenplay for this should go into his basement, chew off his fingers and feed them to his dog. What I'm trying to say here is - don't write any more screenplays, please. PLEASE!",negative
Big Bad Wolves,This film is not for everyone. It takes one of the most disgusting subjects imaginable and turns it into a twisted comedy. You're laughing your head off while castigating yourself for ignoring the dark subject matter which reeks of absolute depravity. But it is funny and you can't help yourself. And so you laugh. But the film keeps you at the edge of your seat gnawing on your knuckles. The male lead is one of my very favorite actors in film today and once I discovered him which was not that long ago I decided to get every film he made and this one came up in my research. No matter how unpalatable the subject matter of this film this actor shines like the star he is. You just cannot take your eyes off him. And that is true star power.,positive
Harlock: Space Pirate,"This review is nothing but spoilers. Read it or don't, but please don't watch this horrible movie.

Harlock: Space Pirate,"It is certainly not a film for children, because of some hidden contents and messages, and also for how some topics have been treated. Yet, Captain Harlock embodies an ideal of freedom that we all seek, since we are babies. For all our attempts to act in full autonomy, we are seen as ""different"" and judged, often condemned. This animated rendering film is a potential Digital Masterpiece, compelling and convincing. The job done by the creators is almost perfect. The attention is captured since the end, and the figure of Captain Harlock is seen by the eyes of the ""others"", and yet it's heavily present, in the Whole film! You must see it!",positive
The Villain,"To start, there are some basics that need to be stated: 1. Shradhha Kapoor is a terrible actress as yet 2. Just because an actor does a negative role wearing different coloured contacts doesn't make that character's rendering 'OOH LA LA' or the actor great 3. Keeping deadpan expressions throughout a movie DOES NOT show intensity 4. A rickshaw-wallah from the streets of UP/ Bihar would've done better acting than Kamaal Khan - and probably for free - Suri could've saved money right there for Ekta Kapoor 5. Making a statement like ""I wasn't born with dialogues in my head and I have been inspired by the films I have watched and the books I have read"" DOES NOT mean that Mohit Suri did not copy the movie. It still means he's a thief.That's that. Other than the points above, the movie was horrendously bad. Remo's parts were pathetic. Deshmukh never fit into the role. Malhotra barely lived through it. S Kapoor tried to whiz through her parts, and is good only from a eye candy perspective. Shaad Randhawa was spectacularly unconvincing. Aamna Sharif was kinda stupid.But Suri included waterboarding :) Atta boy, that's keeping with the times. Didja watch a film on that or read The Annals of Gitmo?One last observation: might be a good idea to let people give actual reviews, rather than make your Indian friend create Polish sounding IMDb profiles to write rave reviews...",negative
The Villain,"I for one thought it was an excellent movie. Okay, seriously though, so many people are complaining that it's a Korean movie ripoff, but how many really saw that movie in the first place? Regardless of where the plot is derived from it was an enjoyable watch. It was great! The only qualm I had was Remo Fernandez's performance. It was rather contrived, but honestly that is about it. The non- linear plot format was intriguing, especially when compared to modern and rather stale mainstream Bollywood films. The various characterizations as well as embedded parallelism and circular plot progression can also provide good post-movie conversations. Despite reading negative reviews about Malhotra, a all I can say about him is wow. Not only is he magnetic on screen but he did exactly what he had to. He doesn't have many lines in the film, but he manages to convey his character's issues so well! Riteish was very good--I wanted to hurt him myself, and Shraddha was also very good. I honestly think that those who are reading the negative reviews and deciding to take a hike are truly missing out! Watch it!",positive
The Second Mother,"Of course .Everyone knows that if you are rich, you are idiot, miserable ,fat and you smoke joint all day along.But if you are poor you are genius ,and kind .It is something like Mexican tv series cliche.However, it has good shots, and actors are very good.I could be a lot better with fewer cliche .",negative
The Second Mother,"It's not everyday that we get a film like this, not willing to really dive into the political, social issues that pervade everyday life, and the cultural barriers and differences that micro- aggressions really make. The acting in this is superb, especially from Regina Case. It's all very natural and in the vein of real life, to an almost unbearably disturbing extent. The screenplay and directing are superb. None of it is at all showy, but it all builds up to quietly powerful, and deeply emotional, moments and scenes. The characterization is rich and it all really sneaks up on you in terms of its effect. definitely recommended, although it's not for those wanting loud or showy extravaganza.",positive
Madaari,"This is such a powerful film, and not just a film, but a powerful statement. The plot of the film deals with a man who has lost the only thing in life that is dear to him.As a single parent, Nirmal Kumar(Irrfan Khan) life is fulfilled by caring for this little boy. All the spare time he has he spends with his son, playing with him and teaching him. On one occasion his son remarked about the whereabouts of his mother and he said that she left him for a career in the United States. However Nirmal's life is shattered by an unforeseen calamity. I will not reveal more - you will have to see this brilliant film directed by an extraordinary director: Nishikant Kamat. I have already seen his previous films: Force(2011), Drishyam(2015) and Rocky Handsome(2016). I have also seen him act in the film 404(2011). I have mentioned again and again how impressed I am with Irrfan Khan's steady rise in Bollywood. He is becoming the undisputed people's champion with films like these. I enjoyed his performance in Billu Barber(2009) and again in The Lunchbox(2013). In this film he is at the pinnacle of his acting prowess. He has managed to make tears fall from my eyes at many points in this film. This is a powerful psychological drama and very relevant in today's world. The effect new digital technology is making in spreading information quickly around the world is shown in this film. Smartphones are by the billion in India, and then we have the newer iPads. So technology wise, a lot has changed in India. The age-old problem of government corruption in India is re-emphasized. Before I forget, I would like to mention the superb music in the film by the veteran music director Pritam. He has directed music in such hits like Dhoom(2004), Gangster(2006), Jab We Met(2007), Race(2008) and Bajrangi Bhaijaan(2015).More film recommendations: Aakhree Raasta(1986), Hatya(1988), Dayavan (1988), Prahaar: The Final Attack(1991), Indian(1996), Yeshwant(1997).Very special mention Kireedam(1989). This blockbuster film was remade in Hindi as Gardish(1993) directed by Priyadarshan. Kireedam has a sequel film Chenkol(1993) which was never dubbed or remade in Hindi.",negative
Madaari,"It's a gem of a movie, largely carried on by Irrfan Khan and an expressive chunk of kid (Vishesh Bansal) & grit of Jimmy Shergill (he is wasted though). The depiction of Father-Son relation is directed beautifully ...u can actually fall for them In here Irrfan doesn't try to be the one man army fighting against the system unlike almost all vigilante justice movie, instead he lets the situation, grief and purpose drive the movie with his exceptional acting (among the best v have seen) especially the post- accident hospital sequence is gut wrenching. The dialogues carry punch and tears apart our psyche.Nishikant Kamath's best direction after Mumbai Meri Jaan, though the movie falls short at some instances but they are well overlapped by Irrfan Khan's brilliance If you loved A Wednesday u will admire MadaariP.S: it is a shame that such movie will hardly gather 10% of what BRAINLESS movies earn this days... no doubt we are living in denial !!!",positive
Wazir,"With its IMDb page created 14 years ago before the film finally released, the makers' attempt at checkmating their audience with their crime drama only results in a stalemate where the game is mostly declared a draw.The story starts with a death, as dutiful and physically fit anti-terrorist operations officer Daanish (Akhtar) regrets his decision of impulsively going behind a known terrorist when he is out with his family. Seeking vengeance, he goes on a rampage and gets himself suspended, only to meet Dhar (Bachchan), a widowed and physically disabled chess enthusiast, who is fighting his own devils after his teen daughter was killed in a mysterious accident. They become friends, and so starts a game of chess as Daanish becomes a friendly yet courageous horse for Dhar to find his daughter's killer.Slow motion and suspended audio hook effects in the initial sequences marvelously entices its audience's attention, and it stays that way through the first act. However, Hydari's character evokes a sort of necessary but terse drama into the narrative which continues to happen throughout the movie. With good dialogs and a well-written screenplay, stylistic antagonists appear and drive the story forward. Mukesh's aura is appreciably different for what he's worth, and Nambiar fancily uses his charm to herald a new type of villain into Bollywood that is away from the deadpan elements we have been seeing in celluloid these past years.However, the story has one too many flaws. Minor ones like Dhar driving a vehicle without his limbs in place can be forgiven, but if one digs deeper into the story that lays itself out in the second act, one will realize that the game which started with 8 ferocious pawns only has one pawn left and it is up to this pawn to take the film forward to a conclusive end. Of course it does, and it does beautifully, but the speed of this transition of a humdrum crime case turning into a thriller is too fast. Flip flops between the drama and the case affects the narrative, only to create an unrest in the audience.So, as the pawn sets out to find the mysterious wazir, queen dies, and the king is high on vodka. Since the queen is dead, the game is more or less over. The wonderful climax is all that saves the pawn from going out on a limb, and manages to salvage the whole game.Cast is brilliant; Akhtar and Bachchan are both good, but one will find the latter more believable in his character. Hydari just mops and sobs, while Mukesh does better acting in his 60-second space than in all his rest of the filmography combined. All said and done, Nambiar's attempt thankfully does not get convoluted, and is read out clearly in its 100 minute running time, but still the story has its flaws and the gist of it is nothing new that our palettes haven't tasted before.BOTTOM LINE: Bejoy Nambiar's Wazir is an inventive thriller whose base story may be ordinary, but watch out for the titular character, for he may impress you with his faith and power and sheer thirst for retribution.GRADE: C+Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES",negative
Wazir,"I have waited for many days for this movie to release.. I have also been hearing about this film when it was just written on a paper by Vinod Chopra. and since the i day saw the trailer.It was so gripping with Amitabh Bachchan and Farhan Akhtar playing some serious roles in it. and yes!! Farhan Akhtar cant do anything wrong..he proved this again!! i saw the movie today with very controlled expectations because 2015 was the year of disappointments like Roy and all.. The movie started in a very first shot.. sudden characters introduced..the screenplay,bringing forward the characters and adorable performances by Akhtar and Sir Bachchan.. Amitabh is still one of the most power pack performers in India. 90 minutes of the movie never disappointed me because of the twisted twist in the end!! Surely the movie,as Vidhu Vinod Chopra said earlier that The plot revolves around the rules of the chess..sacrifices,assassinations,authorities and loyalty were its ingredients.. May be Indian audience isn't still prepared for these kind of sharp stories(and i don't expect they will be) Movies like Dilwale and Prdp are regarded as good movies.. and i see no chances Indian Audience gonna improve their perspective for the movies that deserves appreciation and by the way i also have twist in the end for you readers...i.e the title of this review is for Masala movie lovers :) thank you :)",positive
Piku,"Anything shot with a movie camera cannot be called a film if it is simply loaded with television aesthetics. Hindi film 'Piku' is one good example of an atrociously horrible piece of junk shot on a film camera. This so called 'film' is nothing but a vulgar collection of crude scatological jokes and references about an old man suffering from constipation. It is not only the theme of the film which would afflict the viewers but also the bad performances by its so called 'stars'. Amitabh Bachchan is a complete disaster as an eccentric old man who tries hard to imitate a Bengali man's accent but fails miserably. He is causing irreparable damage to his iconic image by doing roles which do not do any justice to his personality. The Amitabh Bachchan factor is surely missing in this film as nobody would bother to applaud actor Amitabh Bachchan playing an old man's role. To add insult to the injury,there is also icing on the cake in the form of mediocre overacting by Deepika Padukone and Irrfan Khan. This Bollywood disaster has been promoted as a work of art about a father/daughter relationship. However, the truth is that it tries to mix elements from different genres and fails miserably. For this reason, audiences are visually tortured in the name of a drama to watch a flop film which also shows an insipid road movie and a drama about ancient versus modern in the form of the sale of an old house. Lastly, if your staple diet of entertainment revolves around insipid comedy shows shown on Indian television, Piku is the ideal piece of nonsense for you. Those who worship cinema as an integral form of art are advised to stay away from this piece of inane, puerile madness.",negative
Piku,"Just like Bhashkor Banerjee doesn't like liars I wouldn't want to keep my readers in dark for long. I just loved the film. I loved each bit of this film from the core of my heart. It is the best (if there is any other) slice of life, road trip film to have come out of Bollywood in recent history. The film has all the ingredients to be a wonderful cinematic journey and it just doesn't fail. It has the star of the millennium leading from front. Many would also go to the extent of calling him the actor of the millennium as well and I would rather choose to agree than to disagree. It also has one of the best character actors that Bollywood has today. It also has someone by the name of Deepika Padukone who is no way close to the other two when it comes to acting but she is learning and she must get the credit for that. Not to miss out on the fact that she also manages to take your attention on the screen away from none other than Big B himself, courtesy her charm. She plays her part well enough to make the film a joyous journey. And over all this you have Shoojit Sircar, who has now started to show glimpses of brilliance through simplicity, a tag that has been associated with Basuda and Hrishida for long. He seems to have perfected the art of taking difficult subjects and turning them into supremely smooth slice of life films.The film never gets distracted from its central subject which is Bhashkor Banerjee's stomach just like the Banerjee family never gets time to discuss anything else. The film is a joyride for the whole of 2 hours and 5 odd minutes. It makes you laugh out loud for phases lasting from few minutes to tens of minutes, only to slice new layers of sensitivity in the next few. Even though the span of the film is a few days, Sircar so skilfully is able to show us the deeper traits of all the characters that you begin to relate with each one of them. There are hardly any weaknesses in the film, but the strongest of strengths is the realness of the film. There are quite a few slice of life films that Bollywood has been able to create in last few years, none is as natural as this.The film begins with a lot of fast edits, which are required when you have a real Bengali situation with real people trying to make multiple points unintentionally moving towards a chaotic confluence of non-ideas. The film could have easily made use of quite a few cinematography tricks to please you on the road trip, but why would it ever need to con the audience when it has such amazing character waiting to give you a free laugh and a cheerful tear. Instead, he uses Anupam Roy's brilliant voice and composition to blend with the screenplay. There are surely quite a few stereotypes that the film breaks and at the same time there are few it doesn't because some stereotypes just don't go.At 70, Amitabh Bachchan is still at the top of his game. If you have ever been a big Bachchan Saab fan and have not got the best of him lately, this is going to be your dope. His comic timing will put all comedians of today put together to shame. The way he has played the part of an over anxious, ageing and well-meaning Bengali is only something that he could have done and no one else. Needless to say the reason why Irrfan Khan is who he is today is his natural dialogue delivery and he does it again. Every time he delivers a dialogue or even when he communicates in silence, it becomes a treat to watch.As the story of the film moves ahead, the landscape shifts from the crowded Delhi roads to the 'cultured' streets of Calcutta. Each frame shot in the last 20 minutes of the film will rekindle your love for the city of joy and would want to make you go there again, not just for the aesthetics of the frame but because it speaks through the character of its wood and the structure of its soul. I would not want to spoil anything for you, but I can not not mention the scene where the 70 year old Bhashkor Banerjee rides a bicycle and wanders through Calcutta's core with the look of a child. You would want to watch these five minutes again and again.Go watch Piku today, and don't just leave it at the theatres, bring it home through your hearterr.stomach.",positive
Kaabil,"Hrithik Roshan tries hard and offers us a great performance but the film plays strictly by numbers and you can see everything coming from a mile. The movie begins with romance between two people who cannot see which is full of cliché and the scenes that just makes you cringe. I have seen old serials having way better romance development scenarios between normal couple, but this was between two blind people. It should give you this warm-touching feelings, but it catastrophically suffers from awkward expressions and dreadful acting, then their relationship goes into fast-forward pace in a song and both are ultimately married except a tragedy befalls the couple, and then things gone awry.-And this is where movie truly suffers from, you see at every point movie desperately tries to make it look serious and dark except it fails at every point. You have an item song, right after a blind guy's blind wife gets raped and I should mention she got raped twice, and then she committed suicide. I was feeling so frustrated at that point towards the writers who I don't know what crack they were smoking when they thought of adding an item song when the movie suddenly goes so dark and negative. As a Man, I just felt terrible and horrible, we just had seen a blind wife brutally getting raped. I can't imagine how women felt when they went to watch this movie. After that, we have your typical mouse and cat revenge story with tons and tons of plot holes, at that point all I felt is that this movie is playing with my emotions and feelings.1. The very first plot hole is that A post-mortem is carried out as soon as possible after the suicide on behalf of the coroner as part of the investigation to establish the cause of death. It usually takes place within one or two days of the death, but none of that happened. I guess someone forgot how the laws and rules work before writing the story.2.The main reason it turns into a revenge story because the protagonist (Hrithik) couldn't bring justice to his late wife because the person who raped his wife (Rohit) is the brother of Ronit who is actually a minister which is established this late into the story out of nowhere and misuses his corrupt powers to control the cops. Okay, I might have understand this if this movie was made in 70s-80s, but this is 2016, no one gets away with such brutal crime these days, and he was not even a big shot. He is just some small unknown corporate minister, don't ask me, the movie never tells us that either.3. From start till the end, you will constantly feel that the movie is missing something, it just feels so condensed, the movie repeatedly goes back and forth between the home where Hrithik lives, the police station, the telephone booth and one or two more new locations where Hrithik takes his revenge on the culprit which are exactly the same locations that you will see in the first half. The movie never goes or develop further beyond that, it just feels like a B-grade budget movie.4. The movie takes no effort into developing any sort of character development or their personality like why the protagonist is blind where are his parents, why the Heroine is blind where are her parents? The villains in this movie has no motivations either, they are plainly dumb like a villains drawn by a school kid to further glorify protagonist.5. As for the revenge, the protagonist comes with a brilliant plan, he has a talent for mimicry and can make lots of different voices and noises, so his plan is to make culprits fight each other by mimicking their voices magically and that's ladies and folks the brilliant revenge plan the writers thought of. I thought they were making a serious movie, but at this point it felt like a cheap comedy movie.6. His revenge is all about killing, but he never thinks of exposing them to the media or public, so that the people can realize, how corrupt is everyone and he will be doing a great job for other women and couples, so that they won't have to go through what he went through. He even completely forgot about the cops who took money from the minister, so that they won't take his case. He even befriends one of them later into the story, WTH. You should be killing those cops too if one of them did their job right, your wife might be alive right now.7. The worst part is the conclusion when the cops discovers that it was after all the protagonist doing all the murders, so to gather all the proves they check the call recording and went to the phone booth where he makes all those calls. So to match person, the cop takes out Hrithik's photo to ask whether he comes in daily to make regular calls. It was like the whole cop force was depending on this one alone proof, but the guy turned out to be a blind too and everyone returned empty-handed. So let me get this straight, are you telling me that in one small location Hrithik manage to find a blind woman and also a blind person who coincidentally takes care of a local phone booth too. Is Hrithik really is blind? How did he manage to find an other blind person, but guess what? The movie doesn't bother to explain that to you either.:Honestly, I can go on and on about how bad this movie is and Can Hrithik Roshan act? No question about it. Can Hrithik hack it, in Kaabil, a film that gives him every opportunity to gain lost ground? That's a toughie.",negative
Kaabil,"Awesome movie....Hrithik is back.A smart film well acted by Hrithik ,Yami,Ronit,Rohit.But,the highlight of the film is Hrithik's bravura performance. He is vulnerable as a lover and menacing as a killing- machine. It is Hrithik's film from the word go. He is there in almost every scene, and he seems to be in control of the proceedings. As a person who has suffered and is holding himself back from crying, he has done fairly well. Yami Gautam, like Ronit Roy, is already typecast as a wife/lover who leaves her partner midway. Hrithik Roshan and Sanjay Gupta consciously don't project Rohan Bhatnagar as someone you should pity. This works and you realise this is the story of an underdog you want to win. But you need more than a few 'Kamzor mat samajh' kind of dialogues to completely root for Rohan. Barring the regular approach to filmmaking, Kaabil embellishes Hrithik credential as a fine action hero.A must watch!!!!!!!!",positive
Telling Tales,"We know the director and writer of 'Bana Masal Anlatma' since 'Leyla and Mecnun' which was the most popular comedy in Turkey, actually still it is. The man who I am talking about is Burak Aksak. It is widely accepted, everyone who watched Leyla and Mecnun, including me, want to watch a film is produced by Burak Aksak. This is his first movie. Pretty successful but the film has lots of mistakes in it. According to me, whole mistakes are acceptable because the director and the movie reach one's goal that is amusing us. If you do not care details of the film, you would have fun. Nonetheless, I would like to talk about the biggest one.The love between Jilet (Gürkan Uygur) and Neriman (Gökçe Bahadır)... We do not know what happened before everything, also we cannot imagine what happen next.On the other hand, It was so ironic that Cengiz Bozkurt is playing a character who is stingy. This was ironic due to he played similar role in Leyla and Mecnun.In addition, all witticisms are staying away from swearing and bad words. Therefore, we can see creativity of the writer who is Burak Aksak.Finally, If you want to laugh and miss Leyla and Mecnun go to the cinema and watch ""Bana Masal Anlatma"". You would not regret but like I said, do not mind about details.",negative
Telling Tales,"Technically flawless, perfectly natural, and hilariously funny.Writer&director Burak Aksak put an extraordinary performance, similar to his previous works like Leyla ile Mecnun and Ben de Özledim. The story is very natural and warmhearted. The change of people, cities, and life itself is portrayed in a both sentimental and amusing way.Acting, directorial technique, screenplay and music score are on a very high level. The actors credit include both young and talented actors beside very experienced and master actors in Turkish Cinema.As a person whose life mostly is based on dramatic events, this movie made me burst into tears with amazingly funny and extremely emotional scenes.

Chennai Express,"This Movie is really Boring.. Even though first Half is better and entertaining, movie eventually becomes so irritating after interval. My rating is 1 out of 10. Deepika's acting is good, but so many unwanted drama scenes are inserted in the movie.. which makes it a headache. Story is not that much interesting, and could be completed within 1 Hour and 50 Minutes. But No...!! Rohit Shetty pulled it with boring dialogs and drama scenes. Songs starts when they are undoubtedly NOT REQUIRED. there is a part in movie when there are 2 songs in 15 minutes of interval. Ending fight is too long to tolerate. and finally, movie ends in a DDLJ style, which is the most predictable from the maker of the movie..",negative

Kick,"This is the worst movie I have seen of Salman Khan. It was intolerably stupid and a pain to watch. I had not expected too much from this Bollywood movie but this one crossed all the limits. I wanted to walk out of the theater in the first ten minutes itself, but somehow sat in for the whole movie. The movie starts with an absurd fighting sequence that is stretched beyond any reason. The movie is too cheesy and Salman Khan looks like a dimwit for even agreeing to act in this movie. No character, no substance and a total waste of time! The whole story revolves around Salman Khan like any of his new movies, and tries hard to project him as a larger than life figure with cheap antics.",negative

Mohenjo Daro,"Same ol story, A simple farmer who saves a beautiful girl and falls in love with her. He then must challenge and fight against overwhelming odds. We come to know that the city is ruled by a tyrant n his son is engaged to the same girl.1)Puzzling why this film is set in the Indus Valley Civilization, given the alarming lack of attention to detail. I will not get much into historical inaccuracies but jus a few laughable inaccuracies. 2)Characters seem to have found razors n scissors. Nicely trimmed sideburns, hair n moustaches. 3)Lead actress is tribal only in her headdress. With her headdress, she looks more like Santanico pandemonium from Dusk till dawn. Her thigh-high slit skirt is straight from the red carpet. 3)Majority of historians agree that females had bangles all the way up their arms and nothing else on bodies. 4)The story is set in 2016 BC, thousands of years prior before the world's first gymnasium was invented. Lead actor is ripped with lean muscles. 5)Now coming to Hrithiks acting. He has been the same in every character he has played in each of his films. Same ol lean muscles, same hair style n same accent. His cheeks shake when he's angry, and his voice becomes ever more pronounced while expressing rage. These are all traits the actor displayed in his debut film, 'Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai', and which remain unchanged 16 years. The same was in Agneepath n Bang bang. 6)Something to laugh about- our hero Hrithik wrestles a rubber crocodile. Badly done. 7)The fights in the colosseum. Wow man. Gladiators in mohenjo daro. Still very badly done. 8)Horses in mohenjo??? This movie is an epic disaster of biblical proportions. Boring, full of clichés. The editin is bad, screenplay is one of the worst, acting was horrible by all except Kabir bedis. The direction is pathetic n very dull n stale cinematography.",negative

Kelebekler,"I watched this at the festival when it was presented.
I had plenty of people around me laughing hard for every single sentence (often serious dialogues) but I didn't. I thought to myself may be I am in a bad mood today because this is not funny at all.
When eventually after the projection the lights were turned on and there was the QA session with the director I looked around and I got the answer to my question: pretty much all the audience was Turkish.
I guess it's true what they say about Turkish and Indian films, they are really good for nationals but fail to make it internationally because they are not understood by other cultures.
If you think I'm harsh ask yourself if you would laugh to sentences like e.g.:
mom killed herselfa suicidal man left a note: sometime I feel good sometime I feel badIf you do I guess you have a Turkish sense of humor and this movie is indeed for you.There were 4 times where I think I smirked but the overall ""have to laugh for everything"" approach spoiled those moments too.",negative

The Meddler,"The movie starts in an Apple Store where Susan Sarandon buy a new Iphone. She explains that the 64GB model is better than the 16GB one. After few minutes she is at a pre maman party, and gift the new mother with an iPad. She explains that it's a very good gadget, that you can install things on it, and the young mother wows very loud at the tablet. Next scene we are on an Apple store, where we can see the ""genius"" explaining to her how to zoom in and out. At the 15 minutes mark we are at her daughter's house, and on the bed we can see a Macbook. She try to look at the history on safari, but then the daughter comes, and takes the laptop away.If you want to see a 100 minutes Apple commercial, this movie is for you!",negative
The Meddler,"Characters like Marnie, the role played by Susan Sarandon in this film, I find really hard to tolerate. In fact I wasn't going to watch the film but decided to only because I knew Sarandon would elevate it. And now, having read some of the reviews here, I realize how comparable it was to Sally Field's recent film, My Name is Doris.What these two films share in common, besides being made watchable thanks to the talents of their respective main star, is that they were character portrayals of the aging baby boomer as a childlike character.As an aging baby boomer female myself, I found myself asking, with both films, but I'll stick to The Meddler here, did Marnie take too many drugs in her youth? Because there's something so innocent, spaced out, cutesy, and ultimately kind of brain dead, about her.Reviewers have referred to her as happy, cheerful, smiling, caring, etc. which are all accurate, but when I ask myself, is she someone I'd like to spend time with, or even have as my mother, my answer is a resounding No. Maybe because in my own family I was the ""adult child"" I think I'd have to assume that role with Marnie, too. Because frankly she fits into la la land so perfectly. And I always feel that characters/people like that are able to get away with something that I can't. Which is all to say watching The Meddler was a mixed experience.",positive
Dheepan,"This movie resonates with current political and social debates in France in complicated and perplexing ways because while it does an excellent job of richly depicting the difficulties that newcomers to France might face -- problems related to the administration, problems with language, problems with finding satisfactory housing, and jobs, all of which makes for a tense and very engaging opening hour or so of the film -- its portrayal of the housing projects in the suburbs of Paris, where our characters end up, isn't so praiseworthy. It resorts to a clichéd and problematic presentation of these places being little more than no-law / ""no-go"" zones, a contrived setting that ultimately contributes to what we felt was a disappointing and frustrating ending for a filmmaker as good as Audiard.For a more detailed review of the film, please visit our eponymous web site.",negative
Dheepan,"In our review for Robert Guédiguian's wonderful film ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro"" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1852006/reviews-6) we raised the question whether Art should be an imitation of life or whether it should be the other way around. The advocates of realism will make the first choice since, in their opinion, life is full of ugliness that Art must faithfully portray. As is often the case, the artist does not even distinguish between realism and pessimism. In the case of cinema, in particular, the audience must leave the theater full of dark thoughts and feelings of vanity; happy ending is a taboo and a positive message should be hard to find. Idealism, on the other hand, reserves a more noble and ambitious role for Art by creating high standards of human character, thus offering psychological, ideological and aesthetic motivation for man to overcome the inherent weaknesses of his nature and morally elevate himself by striving to reach these standards. Guédiguian's film masterfully balances between these two opposite philosophical trends. One could hardly say anything less about Jacques Audiard's ""Dheepan"" (Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival). In the first place, the subject – immigration to Europe from war-torn places of the Third World – is so timely that the film almost acquires the character of a documentary. The audience, however, progressively witnesses a marvelous transformation from the harsh reality of human survival to the final triumph of human moral exaltation! Here is the beginning of the story: ""Dheepan"" is a freedom fighter of the ""Tamil Tigers"" in the Sri Lankan Civil War. The war approaches its end and defeat of the revolutionaries is imminent. Dheepan, whose entire family was lost in the war, decides to flee the country together with a woman and a little girl – two persons previously unknown to him as well as to each other – in the hope that, by pretending that they are a family, it would be easier for them to claim asylum somewhere in Europe. Arriving in Paris, the ""family"" seeks temporary housing while Dheepan tries to earn some money by selling little things under the nose of the Police. Finally, he finds a permanent job as a caretaker in a building block somewhere in the suburbs. Although the place is miserable and, moreover, is a den of unlawful activities, Dheepan works hard to build a new life for him and his new family... The craftsmanship of the narrative lies in the wonderful balance between the hard realism of the subject and the cinematic poetry that permeates the film from beginning to end. This narrative carefully and skillfully avoids the traps of over-sentimentalism and political didacticism, as well as the temptation of sanctification or demonization of the various characters, as such oversimplifications would undoubtedly undermine the artistic result. The main heroes, in particular, are not a priori ""good"". They discover the good parts of their own nature as the story progresses, thus developing as human beings in the process. It is precisely this miracle of character revelation and moral elevation in front of the viewer's eyes that makes cinema such a wonderful art, after all. And, even if it seems too idealistic to be true, this miracle is far from representing a utopia!",positive

Highway,"Highway (Review) – After 'Rockstar', director Imtiaz Ali is now back with his latest road movie 'Highway' starring Randeep Hooda and Alia Bhatt in the lead. Even though there wasn't as much hype, the movie had created a healthy buzz. 'Highway' begins with Veera Tripathi played by Alia Bhatt being kidnapped while she is on a highway with her fiancé by a group of gangsters and one of them being Mahabir Bhati played by Randeep Hooda. Veera is kidnapped by Mahabir Bhati and his gang as she has witnessed a roadside shootout at a petrol pump by the gang. Veera is the daughter of a VIP in Delhi and the gang is unaware of it and when they get to know about it, they continue keeping her in custody trying to blackmail Veera's family for ransom. Veera who is initially traumatised by the whole saga slowly gets used to being with the gang and starts enjoying her time with them as she would never have had that much freedom back home. Veera once describes the entire trauma that she underwent as a child in her family to Mahabir after which he starts to be a bit more considerate towards her. Mahabir and his gang alongwith Veera keep travelling from one place to another all over India. Meanwhile the search for Veera is on in full swing back in Delhi. This forms the first half of the movie. What happens to Veera? Will she finally be back with her family, is to be watched in what is the best part of the movie, the beautiful and an engaging second half. The best technical aspect of the film is the cinematography as the highways and the mountains and the streams in Himachal Pradesh are captured beautifully. Performance of Alia Bhatt might seem like a shadow of Kareena Kapoor in 'Jab We Met' for the first 5 minutes but later enters into her own zone and has performed brilliantly in a couple of scenes. Randeep Hooda plays the tough guy throughout the movie and also a man showing his emotions when reminded of his mother very well. Music by the maestro A.R. Rahman is also worth appreciating as a couple of tracks like Patakha Guddi, Sooha Sooha and Maahi Ve stand out. Rahman leaves his stamp in Maahi Ve especially. Oscar winner Resul Pookutty has done a brilliant job in sound design as well. Imtiaz Ali has done a commendable job in making this movie and presenting the way it should be without adding unnecessary junk. Movies of this kind need to be promoted and encouraged as they form a perfect bridge between class and mass films thereby paving the way for other filmmakers to make similar attempts. Watch 'Highway' for its authenticity, ethnicity, brilliant camera-work and a beautiful second half. My verdict – 8/10",negative
Highway,"Let me start by saying that this movie has everything right about it. From direction and cinematography to performances and music. The locations are breath taking.Imtiaz Ali yet again delivers a ""hat ke"" love story. Its not exactly a love story but a tale of two people who want to get free and experience life. Both the characters have there own painful pasts and when they come together they let it all go and try to start it all over again.Their journey is the theme of this movie. Alaya Bhatt and Randeep Hooda deliver power packed performances with a great supporting cast.The movie forces us to think about the society we live in and how people struggle to lead a normal life. Be it a rich family or a poor villager. They have there own challenges.I won't go more into the story line as that is something to be experienced.This movie comes with a message and we are left to think what freedom and liberation means.I will strongly recommend this one.",positive
Tiger Zinda Hai,"These are a few scenes which killed my neurons:
1) Salman's entry scene with wolves is funny and his kid is irritating.
2) As the number of terrorist soldiers increased, Salman switched to bigger guns. At one point, there were 200 soldiers and our hero picked the biggest gun he can find, stood at one place and kept shooting. FYI these 200 soldiers were also shooting back but surprisingly they all missed.
3) They portrayed a big villain in the movie, which of course required a big plot for him to go down. Throughout the movie he was seen with hundreds of soldiers at his disposal but as the movie came to an end and it was high time the villain was killed, they showed him roaming around Salman with just a knife.
4) To kill salman (who was tied to a chair), the villian didn't shoot him. He put him in a room full of toxic gas, asked his men to wear gas mask and then go inside and shoot him.
5) Salman and Katrina escaped a whole city under airstrike, within 3 SECONDS. 
6) Dialogues were written by a kid. Villain: Tu mujhe rokk ke dikha. Salman: Dum hai toh tu mujhe rokk ke dikha.
7) Salman's colleague tells him that it was impossible to diffuse the bomb (tells him twice). Salman tells him, its a matter of country's pride and his colleague diffuses it within seconds.
8) Action scenes had several explosions, most of them happened in empty cars with no enemy around. Didn't understand the director's obsession with exploding empty cars. 
9) Whole movie was formula based: Take what work's best for Indian audience (fuck logic/acting/talent).This list can go on. In simple words, whole movie was bleh. To many of the body builders, single guys/one sided lovers, Muslim youths and others.... please stop being a blind fan.",negative

Kesari,"There is subtle exaggeration to stress on a certain point, and there is blatant exaggeration to the point of absurdity. This movie like all bollywood films does the latter.
For some reason Bollywood has to demean all other community in order to advance their own depictions of valor and courage without exception. For example, all Britishers shown on film has to be inherently sadists, arrogant and abusive and derive personal pleasure from abusing Indians.
Reality, not all Brits were cruel and some even thought highly of Indians and were friends. Many britishers were born in India and even remember their birthplace with pride.In bollywood, the enemy is always backstabbing cowards and there are no exception. Whereas the Indians are always ready to sacrifice. In this movie probably the better course would have been to keep the Afghans as nameless and faceless tribals, more as a horde.Too many unnecessary details added that do nothing to move the plot forward. Understanding this film was completed with budget constraints, I choose not to delve into goofs and factual, technical and historical flaws. But I must say, the makeup, most of all was the least convincing.

Madras Cafe,"'Madras Cafe,' while viewed as a political thriller with special effects and the whole 'bells and whistles,' is nothing more than a racially and politically motivated movie. The film takes place in Sri Lanka during the 1980's when India got involved in the ethnic conflict between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL).It is about an Indian agent from the Research & Analysis Wing (RAW) of the Indian intelligence along with Indian Peace Keeping Forces (IPKF). During their tenure between 1987 to 1989, according to Amnesty International, ""the IPKF along with the GOSL have been engaged in gross human rights violations against the Tamil population of Northeast Sri Lanka, otherwise known as Tamil Eelam."" Why this movie is racially motivated is, because all the bad guys in the film are Tamil. But, not only, that, the LTTE, which is of course proscribed as a 'terrorist' organization in India and in several countries, is misrepresented. Basically, the truth of the history has been twisted, leave alone incorrect. The producer of the film stated that he spent 7 years studying the conflict, but failed on several accounts, that the Tamil Liberation group prohibits drinking and smoking. Even their salute is incorrect in the film.The film further portrays the Tamil rebel leader as a power hungry and incompetent person. Furthermore, it portrays the Government of Sri Lanka, and India as the heroes of the movie. This is no different than making a movie praising the Gestapo of Adolf Hitler in his fight against 'Jewish terrorism' in Germany! Further, all the characters are non-Tamil, while it does not surprise me that the film was screened in US, Canada, and UK in separate theaters with one for Tamil and one for Hindi. This film also is causing a division, not only between North and South India, but between Tamils and Malayalees of the Southern Indian state of Kerala for the fact that all the heroes from India are Keralites, while the bad guys are Tamil. But, even worse, the Malayalee characters are played by actors and actresses of Northern Indian origins not resembling those from Kerala.Now, why is this movie politically motivated? The answer is clear. Sri Lanka has been condemned by International organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Right Watch for its war crimes and crimes against humanity during and after it's final stages of their battle in Northern Sri Lanka. Numerous videos and footage of rapes, torture, and extra-judicial killings have submerged exposing the Genocide of Tamils in Sri Lanka. Also, the upcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Colombo, Sri Lanka and the possibility of an International Investigation of War Crimes committed in Sri Lanka. Another reason for this film to be released is to give more points to the Indian National Congress to win again in 2014. There is no doubt, that both the Sri Lankan Government and the Congress Party of India has financed this film. Furthermore, that through an independent international investigation into war crimes committed in Sri Lanka, India's name will come out specifically from the Congress Party of India, and Indian representatives in the UN.'Madras Cafe' puts the Tamil people in a bad light, and not doubt, restaurant owners in Western countries that go under the name 'Madras Cafe.' Madras in fact was the former name of Chennai, which is the capitol of Tamil Nadu state of South India. No Tamils will support this film with the exception of a few for monetary gain. Other films banned were those such as 'Vishwapooram' and a YouTube movie mocking the prophet Muhammad. This film not only misrepresents history, but it also black lists a particular ethnic group for a political purpose.On an end note, whether good or bad from either side, the truth should not be taken out of the film. If it is a historical film, it should be made as such. One such historical film from the region I would say is fair and balanced would be that of Ben Kingsley's 'Gandhi.' If the producer of this film wanted to show atrocities, he should have shown it as it was historically, including that from India and Sri Lankan forces. As for 'Madras Cafe,' it is far from the truth...",negative
Madras Cafe,"It took 3 films and 7 years for Shoorjit Sircar (director) to deliver us with undoubtedly the best political thriller we can savor ourselves over a long time. 'Madras Cafe' is unarguably a gem of a movie that belongs to a rare genre of Bollywood cinema and deserves much more attention and applause than what it's being receiving.The film is based on the backdrop of the Sri Lankan civil war in the late 1980's and early 1990's. It crosses its path with the plotting and execution of the then, Indian Prime Minster, whom we understandably can make out as Late Mr. Rajiv Gandhi. This film is so well crafted; it was not possible to find out a loophole in the entire plot.John Abraham (Producer), who plays as a RAW Officer has done a 100% justice to his character Vikram Singh. There are noticeable fluent and honest performances from Siddharth Basu and Nargis Fakhri (Rockstar) on the other hand as well. If you want to know more about what's inside, you have to go and watch it yourself. Although just do a bit of homework on the Lankan civil war events that occurred in the late 80's. You would not regret it.There was one drawback of the movie though. The movie had an end. But as they say 'All good things comes to an end'. So, I guess it to be that way.Madras Café is a slap on the faces of all the directors and also on the ignorant and bogged down movie goers who are ardent worshipers of senseless commercial cinema that has plagued Hindi movie industry over the last year and half. John Abraham here has to be appreciated immensely for the effort he has put in out of the movie, since; there was no one who was ready to produce this movie earlier until he accepted this project to invest in.Thank you John Abraham and Shoorjit Sircar.Without any second thoughts, being thankful and much obliged with this Intelligent and brave cinema,..

Labyrinth of Lies,"It's always fascinating to see how WWII still lives on. The question of remembering vs letting bygones be bygones is still as relevant as ever. It seems like every year or so another film on the Holocaust is released. All the more interesting then when it's Germany releasing such a film. Im Labyrinth des Schweigens takes a (for me at least) little explored subsection of postwar Germany, the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials that started in 1963.Johann Radmann is a typical protagonist: young and ambitious; he's also a lawyer. Besides the fact he, like many of his countrymen, is oblivious to the horrors of Auschwitz and the Holocaust is his only character flaw. When an angry journalist alerts him to this fact, he starts to pursue the case of the unprosecuted SS officers with unmatched zeal. Time and again, however, he finds himself with confronted with a society either too ignorant or too unwilling to air its dirty laundry, to really get its troubled past out in the open. Nevertheless, after a herculean effort on the part of Radmann and others, the trial did eventually took place which led to the conviction of 17 people—Gestapos, dentists, adjutants and so on—who were involved in the horrors of Auschwitz.If there's anything Im Labyrinth des Schweigens does well, it's conveying the very silence conveyed in the title. The notion that Nazism was rooted out with the Nuremberg trials is treated with great disdain by the film. The film conveys the naiveté of many of Germany's citizens at the time as well as their reasons for doing so. There's a short scene that perfectly encapsulates this idea: Radmann and his superior are at odds with two colleagues. One of them states that digging up this part of Germany's past can only do more harm than good. Just now, when we're 'trying to move on', a case like this might force every German child to look at his parents with suspicion. Such an effect is toxic he claims to which Radmann's superior responds that it's precisely the forced silence which is toxic, particularly in a democracy which is still so young. In a single short scene we're treated to a convincing representation of both sides of the argument.The film has two weaknesses: strange tonal shifts and a boring, irrelevant romance. The first one is difficult to describe as it makes it sound like I wanted Im Labyrinth to be a melodramatic trauermarsch of sorts with zero comic relief. This is not the case. Aptly timed humor and other non-dramatic content can add greatly to character development and so on, but with Im Labyrinth I felt there were certain tonal inconsistencies. It also doesn't help the film features an incredibly forced romance between Radmann and a young woman. I get that the romance is there to generate a conflict not dissimilar to Fincher's Zodiac, where the investigator's family life is threatened by his obsessions. Im Labyrinth tries to do the same thing, but—save for a few moments—the romance is never really connected to the main storyline, so it feels like an afterthought. There's also some really cringe-worthy writing: during their first (and thankfully only) lovemaking session, she for some reason tells him that 'life's good'uhh, okay. You see where I'm going with this? It just feels like it's going through the motions. The filmmakers first create the obligatory romance and then threaten to disrupt it to make us feel for Radmann, but it never works. This is made all the more strange by the fact that a certain plot twist regarding Radmann's own family is far more convincing in making us feel for him.All in all though, despite the occasional cringe, Im Labyrinth des Schweigens is very interesting to watch. In the end, it undeniably succeeds at what is undoubtedly its main task: illuminating the why and how of Germany's postwar silence on the Holocaust.",negative
Labyrinth of Lies,"It is 1958. Fledgling lawyer Johann Radmann hears of an instance that took place some time in the past during WWII, and of which he has little knowledge. Seems a man complained about abuse of some sort during detention in the war, but the issue was dropped due to lack of interest. Radmann, however, is interested and decides to investigate. He is soon overwhelmed by a mountain of facts in which few people are interested or talk about. War Crimes is the topic, and Radmann can't find anyone among contemporaries who has even heard of Auschwitz.""Labyrinth Of Lies"" is a story about truth, not distorted but obscured or ignored. Life in post-war Germany did not include talk or discussion of wartime concentration camps, since it was old news and the war is over; everyone was doing what they had to do. Radmann is astonished at what he finds and at the magnitude of the atrocity, and whom it encompasses, and at the resistance he encounters.The film is well-done in all respects and told in a semi-documentary aspect that lacks a sanguine feel, as a storyteller detached from the gruesome material. Nevertheless, it is an absorbing film and revelatory for those of us who have wondered how life transpired in Germany after the war. It is the second German-language Holocaust-related film I have seen recently, and personally I thought ""Phoenix"" was a better picture.",positive
Zulu,"Officers Ali Sokhela (Forest Whitaker) and Brian Epkeen (Orlando Bloom) begin investigating the death of a young woman who has been killed by an illegal drug that has recently been supplied to her. In addition to investigating her death, Sokhela and Epkeen also discover that several black people within the area are also either dying or disappearing in mysterious circumstances. Both officers believe that there is a link between the woman's death and the deaths involving black people and set about trying to establish how all the deaths are connected....Given South Africa's rather turbulent and fraught history regarding its 'race-relations' policy a film like Zulu can either be seen as brave or misguided. As an open-minded person myself I tried to view this film objectively and basically take it for what it is and sadly even going in with this forgiving mind-set I still left feeling rather disappointed....For a start the story is unbearably slow and just isn't that compelling (all this despite the fact that it is possibly interesting when looked upon from a recent historical perspective). I haven't read the book and therefore I can't comment on how the characters are perceived in the original source material, but in this film with Whitaker and Bloom I felt like the screenwriters were attempting to portray their characters similar to Murtagh and Riggs from Lethal Weapon - this is more noticeable with Bloom who is the unhinged, gung-ho police officer with a drink problem. The difference between these two films is that Riggs was better developed in Lethal Weapon in that we at least understand why he behaved the way that he did? Bloom's character shares similar traits, but we're never really given any explanation as to why he is the way that he is? Is it because his marriage broke down? The problematic relationship with his child was badly handled and his constant visits to his ex-wife were distracting and often dragged the story in a direction that it didn't need to go in. All this makes him hard to take to as a character and even harder to like or care about. Forest Whitaker gives another good performance and his character is slightly better developed, but again he isn't a particularly interesting character (the most interesting thing about watching his performance was seeing his Idi Amin accent come out of retirement once more).Once I'd made the analogy between the two cops here and the two cops in Lethal Weapon it only reminded me of how dull this film is in comparison. Whilst it may be set during a rather important period in South Africa's history the film sadly is held back by dull and uninteresting characters, and a story that isn't as compelling as it may seem due to its rather plodding nature.",negative
Zulu,"Wouldn't have watched it if not recommended, I wish I had seen this in the cinemas. Just stumbled upon it and the movie sets a notion to prepare it's audience to slowly, gradually and surely lead them into a realist, heart wrenching tale of present day reality in South Africa with such defined details on delivering the story, the character's are more than convincing. The acting and environment just makes me want more of this tale telling... Entertaining, capturing, dragging the viewer into a world so real. Film making at its best glad I watched it as the title, cover and overall rating doesn't come close to doing justice!",positive
Mersal,I thought Atlee was a really good director. But he has the worst creative mind of how to make a film. Hes just only knows how to make blockbuster movies out of very very foolish stories (like the story of Mersal). It just has the worst story. It has been ripped of from many other Tamil and English films. I knew Tamil movies which were copied from other language movies. But this Tamil movie copied from Tamil movies itself. I don't know why Vijay accepted this story.,negative
Mersal,"I went in for the USA Premiere Show (FDFS) For The Much-Awaited Action Entertainer MERSAL. Oh god, the crowd was unbelievable! Everyone was set for a Diwali Treat:) Firstly, the screen presence of THALAPATHY VIJAY, was absolutely amazing, for sure Vijay steals the show right from the title-card to the ending of the movie. His Triple Role : Farmer, Doctor, Magician were all new get ups for Vijay and has he done well with these characters? 100% YES! Right From The ""Mersal Arasan"" To The Flashback Sequences Of The Leader Farmer, Thalapathy excels! As Usual, he excels in his romance, dance, comedy and attitudes throughout the film which keep the audience entertained in each way. The Story by Baahubali Writer ""Vijayendra Prasad"" was quite different even though it had some elements of an action Marsala film but Atlee's direction of the film keep it unique.AR Rahman's BGM is merattal masss! He proves his Oscar winning award in Mersal, songs such as Aalaporaan Thamizhan and Neethanae bring out the audience a real taste of Mersal!SJ Surya as a villain plays his role neatly (look out for his dialogues/scenes in the second half) a perfect suit for the movie - Stylish.Also, actors such as Vadivelu and Sathyaraj stand out not just for their comedy but for their highly rated emotional scenes which Atlee narrates well. Vadivelu fanatics will leave the cinema with smiles on their faces:)Heroines play their role superbly in each of Vijays Characters and so do other actors such as Sathyan, Kovai Sarala, Vikram Vedha's ""Cheta"" etc.GK Vishnu has fantastic cinematography for a debut, thanks to Atlee for giving him an opportunity to see how perfectly he can do his job! Visuals in Aalaporaan Thamizhan and Many of the magician scenes excel, thalapathy is captured spot on!Ruben the editor has done his job well, with neat cuts and editing to keep the movie at a smooth pace.What can I say, a pure Thalapathy Vijay entertainer with high emotional/ mass scenes which will impress the audience of all type. A film for thamizhans to enjoy, so worth the wait? TOTALLY YES, go grab your tickets and have a great Diwali ahead!9/10",positive
RamLeela,"what a pathetic portrayal of an age old story. the movie rides on Deepika Padukone's skin show with excessive use of colour which could irritate one to the core.There is nothing in the movie which could keep the viewer hooked. Abhimanyu singh's talent is totally wasted, wish he had got more screen time. I personally like movies with violence, but Raam-leela is full of mindless, stupid violence. Must say that violence is not Bhansalis cup of tea.When everything was seen falling apart, there came the final nail in the coffin, Priyankas awful item number. Ranveer is okay, after all the hype much more was expected from him. The only saving grace of the film is Supriya Pathak who pulls off a difficult character with panache.",negative
RamLeela,"Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, one of the most anticipated movies of the year releases with all its bang and reveals itself as least related to stuff for which it had been declared controversial.Sanjay Leela Bhansali's take on Romeo-Juliet, despite a known script, seems quite refreshing. The visuals, nobody questions, is by far Bhansali's best. Utterly flawless. You might want to compare the flawed VFX effects of movies like Krrish 3 and Ra. One and find Ram-Leela's visuals standing far ahead of them. The symmetry he puts in, the pattern he develops in every visual is like the best artist would.SLB's poetry, dialogs and expression are so well that you might want other directors to get training from him. The professionalism is of Hollywood standard.The songs are already chart-topping (Nagade Sang Dhol was No.1 on i Tunes for 7 consequent weeks), and when you watch them in the movie you feel mesmerized. So well choreographed are these dances that you couldn't stop yourself from thinking of performing them on some occasion. Though a bit raunchy, Ishkiyaon Dhishkyon seems more funny than vulgar. Priyanka's item number gives mph effect.The strongest part of Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela is the star performances. We do not doubt that Deepika Padukone, who has established herself as an equal of the Vidya Balan and Shaban Azmi only betters herself with this movie, giving her critics a yet bigger challenge. She, as Leela, is flawless. You wouldn't be watching Deepika Padukone, but Leela in the movie. Though in Cocktail, Ye Jawaani ha Deewani and Chennai Express, Deepika was the soul of the movie, here she has to share it with Ranveer Singh who acts equally well. This is his best performance so far. In fact, this is the best performance of the year by a male actor. Richa Chada is shockingly real as Leela's sister-in-law and Supriya Pathak, though sounds a bit like Hansa, is exhilarating and fear-inducing. Every dialog she delivers is pitch perfect.The perfection that Bhansali has expressed in all the aforementioned topics gets polluted by the flawed script. Though in the first half you do not notice how time passes with the songs, acting and the chemistry setting fire to the screen, the second half takes a U-turn. The second half begins with impracticality, which moves on to deal with various serious topics, which is exceptional to a love story. What becomes a problem here is the absence of effective execution of these scenes. The sub-plots are in abundance but all last for so less time that the tears of Leela and Ram do not reflect on the audience's eyes. Before the audience could feel the pain, the scene changes. The ending becomes more like a fairy tale which ruins all the realistic happenings of the movie.Despite its flaw, Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela stands as WORTH WATCHING. One must definitely watch this class-and-mass movie for entertainment, visuals, star performances, songs, and by far the best adaptation of Romeo and Juliet by Bollywood. Go fall in love with Ram-Leela!",positive
Yves Saint Laurent,"Interesting insight into the life and less-known sides of the legendary Yves Saint Laurent. This was more than a mere tribute to the fashion icon by shots of most (if not all) of his successful collections, it was an in-depth description of what it meant to live with and love a sensitive genius who always carried his own crucifix. The dedication of the faithful Pierre was moving as he guarded over his frail partner who might go off anytime like fireworks. Consider me priggish if you will; I felt the film focused slightly too much on the decadence (alcohol, drugs, sex - you name it) of the chief protagonist. Though perhaps for some talented souls, these indulgences served as their Muse. The fashion shows were intoxicating, and the wedding gowns (especially the Madonna) were awe-inspiring and overwhelming. Overall, I'd say a 6.8 out of 10.",negative
Yves Saint Laurent,"In many respects, this biopic of the titular fashion designer is everything you might expect. It is full of beautiful people wearing beautiful clothes in beautiful surrounds. Fortunately though, Yves Saint Laurent is much more than that and we do get some insight into a man whose demons very nearly threatened to derail his reputation and career on more than one occasion. Too often, biographical films try to cram too much into the limited running time that a motion picture necessarily demands, so it is very pleasing that director Jalil Lespert has avoided the temptation to cover every stage of Saint Laurent's life and career, opting instead to focus, for the most part, on his emergence as a pre-eminent figure in French fashion circles and the ensuing bouts of self-destructive behaviour that threatened to overshadow his creative genius. The film does touch on the later stages of Saint Laurent's life, but primarily to contextualise the relationship with lifelong partner Pierre Berge, who we first meet in a pre-credit sequence set after Saint Laurent's death. The story is then told as a recollection of events from Berge, who provides a second-person narration as though it is being delivered to Saint Laurent himself.Pierre Niney takes on the role of the Algerian-born Saint Laurent, who we first meet at home in Oran on the Mediterranean coast. Whilst still in his teens, Saint Laurent finds himself working for Christian Dior, whose death in 1957 propelled Saint Laurent into the role of head designer at Dior's fashion house at just 21 years of age. Already encumbered by a social anxiety that he attributes to childhood bullying, Saint Laurent finds it difficult to cope with the aura of expectation that surrounds him. When he is drafted into the French military, Saint Laurent finds himself unable to cope, is confined to a psychiatric hospital and subjected to electroshock treatment. Sacked by Dior as a result, Saint Laurent establishes his own brand with the help of Berge (Guillaume Gallienne), a cash settlement secured from his former employer and the support of an American investor. From this point, Saint Laurent emerges as a superstar of the fashion world; each new collection met with adoring enthusiasm. However, whilst his professional profile explodes and he cements his reputation as one of the truly great designers, he sets out on a path of self-destruction; partaking in drugs, excessive alcohol consumption and infidelity in an effort to combat the depression, anxiety and insecurity that plague him.This is very much a film that examines the relationship between Saint Laurent and Berge, with the latter emerging as a stoic hero figure who stands by Saint Laurent throughout the tumult that was their personal and business relationship. If what we see is to be believed (and I have no reason to suggest we shouldn't), then Berge was a guardian angel for the troubled designer, serving as manager, constant companion, lover and lifesaver. It is hardly surprising therefore that the real life Berge has endorsed the film, which is based, in part, on his book Letters to Yves. Furthermore, Berge has praised the performances of both actors, telling Vogue magazine that he was ""blown away by Pierre Niney's performance. It really disconcerted me. It even upset me, because it's very difficult. At times, I thought it was Yves Saint Laurent himself. That's huge."" On Gallienne, Berge declared ""I think he's an extraordinary actor."" Of course, as a result of Berge's ties to the project, the filmmakers were granted access to Saint Laurent's original design studio and more than 70 of his vintage outfits and, it must be said, the clothes are stunning. Another key figure in Saint Laurent's life during his rise to fame was model Victoire Doutreleau (played by the stunning Charlotte Le Bon), who was one of Saint Laurent's few close friends until forced out of his life by Berge, who considered her a bad influence.Yes, the film is a celebration of Saint Laurent's creative genius, but it certainly doesn't shy away from the darker side of his personality. It is a reminder of the destructive nature of disorders such as depression and anxiety, even amongst those who seemingly have it all. The film looks elegant – sumptuous even – and the musical score draws upon classical, jazz, rock and opera at different times, to mostly good effect. Ultimately, Yves Saint Laurent is an engaging, if somewhat genteel, examination of the life (or part thereof at least) of a talented yet troubled individual. Lespert has crafted a film that explores the darker side of Saint Laurent's personality without diminishing his legacy as a fashion icon.",positive
Limonata,"I am also far from my homeland and that is why when I started to watch the movie I remembered the hardships of a foreigner and I found closeness in the character of Sakip. However after they leave for Bulgaria, I do not think movie is developing towards good, it is not developing at all. Dialogues are not the job of professionals at all. Sometimes you feel that they put that scene to just fill in the blanks. Too much bad language,always drinking and anger in every situation puts audience in a bad mood as movie rolls. Swearing that much,I think,beats even ""Snatch"". Acting was good especially of Sakip (Saban), directing not so much, but I see that it was the first job of Ali Atay. Scenario is not great, it has a great beginning but not a good ending, dialogues are like the whole film crew were in a hurry. Anger and swearing killed that closeness that I talked about earlier. And I saw at the end of the movie it was dedicated to someone's father and wife, I would not send a present full of negativity (anger and swearing) to my loved ones. I would send a present where there was at least a little bit of love. Yeah love is the missing part in this move. I am not talking about that ""love"", I am talking about compassion.

A Single Shot,"Grim and Gloomy, this Neo-Noir is a Cold Thriller that is Atmospheric and Character Driven. There are some Scary People and some Scary Moments in this Tale of Small Town, Backwoods Glum.

Sam Rockwell Leads a Cast of Familiar Faces that are Buried in Deep Alcoholic Mumbles Punctuated with Low IQ's and High Energy.It Twists and Turns in the way it is On Again Off Again as the Protagonist is Pulled Here and There by His Own Missteps and the Forces of Evil. It is an Intriguing Film, mostly, Hampered Somewhat by some Sloppy Plot Executions in the Middle. There are some Ambiguous Motivations and Dialog along the way, but the Beginning and the Ending are Enough to make this a Fine, Modern, Desperate Exercise in Temptation, Fate, and a Revelation that Yes, it is a Scary World out there and can be all the more Terrifying if You take the Wrong Turn on that Rural Road.",negative
A Single Shot,"This is a serious movie for serious viewers. Sam Rockwell gives a convincing performance as John Moon, a West Virginia cracker who stumbles into bad luck from the opening seen. All of the characters bring to life what it's probably like to live in a rural, poor area in flyover country. The accents of the characters are often thick, which can make it difficult to understand some of the dialog, but the plot nonetheless comes through clearly. Rockwell's character progresses from being a dumb cracker to someone you care about, as the tension builds towards a final resolution of his accidental and potentially deadly predicament. The acting and direction are first rate. The cinematography fits the story; the musical score does likewise. The story is dark, in a Jack London sort of way.

Son of God,"Wowsers! If you're interested in a TV movie on the big screen than this is the movie for you. Featuring a Portuguese actor playing Jesus (because Son of God forbid that an actual Middle Easterner played Jesus in a Jesus movie, lest the Faithful go wild) it is literally the Jesus part of The Bible miniseries that played on cable last year with some extra scenes. The production values are exactly what you'd expect for a TV movie - horrible. They were hoping for a Passion of the Christ like hit, but the movie is almost gone from theaters and it's not even Easter. Ticket sales fell 61% in it's second week , even though it expanded into more theaters.If you want a good movie about Jesus, Passion of the Christ is where it's at.",negative
Son of God,"For those who are expecting a repeat of the Mel Gibson movie, then prepare to be disappointed ... or pleasantly surprised. This movie is the sanitized version of the Gibson extravaganza. It is the movie that Gibson would have made if he had decided to ease off on the gratuitous depictions of violence. Depicting violence in a movie about Christ is unavoidable; it is part of the story. The violence has to be shown. The question is: how, without the violence itself becoming the main theme? This movie sticks to the story about Jesus; the violence is a part of the story. He is beaten, mocked, scorned, discredited, tortured, crucified and murdered. The story is told in its entirety. Yet, the director succeeds in telling the story in a straightforward non-sensationalist manner. By emphasizing Christ's humanity he brings the audience into the story. Regardless of your religious beliefs, one can relate to Jesus, his ministry and what he is trying to accomplish. His actions are plausible and understandable. His preaching is simple, sensible and comprehensible. His suffering and anguish is pitiful; his resurrection miraculous. Here the movie is strongest. Unlike the Gibson film, the resurrection is given full treatment and concludes the movie on a positive note, which is appropriate. The story of Jesus Christ requires no embellishment; it speaks for itself. Jesus was born, conducted his ministry, was betrayed, and was sacrificed. This is how the story is depicted in this movie. What more should anyone expect?",positive
Arjun Reddy,"The emotions in the love story are nothing more than kissing, and the word ""baby"". The protagonist always has some philosophy to cover up for the situation to prove that he is correct. The father/brother emotions are not sufficiently built. It would have been good if the brother characterization was built better, as to how he attempts to save his brother, or how the family would free him from drug addiction through showing of love. Overall, more of a story that dives deeper and deeper into tragedy. The boy is shown to be an excellent doctor. Even to excel in profession/academics, I believe a person would need to have a lot better self-control than what the protagonist seems to possess.",negative
Arjun Reddy,"It has been a refreshing experience watching this movie. The romance, characterization is at its raw best. I am glad that the director and his team did not do anything to dial it down. The performances have been great. We all know the story, but it has not been done before in Telugu cinema. In some ways, this can be called modern Devdas with realistic dialogue.Without spoiling; the story is about a young MBBS student with anger management issues falling in love. Arjun Reddy's character is deeply flawed. I must appreciate the director and crew steering away from the Telugu movie way of showing the lead character in a perfect light. I am glad the character is flawed. There are several instances in this 186 minute movie that shows us the flawed side of our hero. It works out for the story telling. Also in this tale, we see characters yelling swear words when under stress or anger; which does not happen in other flicks.The physical romance couldn't be more appropriate. It's is present where necessary and only promotes story telling and emotions. Also, the story is also about a bunch of characters constantly caring and supporting Arjun Reddy despite his strong requirement for sole confinement. The sick kick friend is more than a side kick shows real spine in tense moments, also providing subtle comedy in the various situations. The movie does not commit to one message. The grandma says ""a person who wants to suffer must be left alone and that person will soon get back on his feet""; But almost all characters related to the hero (Brother, friends) always keep visiting Arjun despite Arjun yelling them to go away. It was the supporting friends and family that bring back a almost lost soul back. When Arjun loses everything, left with no money and thrown on the road; it's the brother and father who spend their money to send Arjun to exotic countries to help him get over the girl.The movie doesn't seem 3 hour long, but definitely feels lengthy, often straining the eyes. Preethi's character is underdeveloped, but she did a decent job at that. The heroin side track was unnecessary and does not contribute much.Overall, this is a refreshing change in Tollywood and I can see a lot of directors experimenting by not following the Telugu formulaic trend in the upcoming years.",positive
Raid,"The main problem with Raid is that from the trailer itself you know the whole story of the film and for the most part, it's a film that has been seen in Indian films way too many times. But the making is better than most of the previous iterations of the story in a way that it skips a lot of mandatory checkboxes and just barely satisfies some of them for a popular Bollywood film format for becoming a genre film. There are some very good moments in between too, but it soon becomes repetitive and there is no real tension because anyone can predict the next scene if they are familiar with some of the Indian political crome films and the film never tries anything new.",negative

The Insult,"Greetings again from the darkness. When a film opens with a statement that 'the views expressed are those of the authors and director, and not of the government of Lebanon', one quickly understands the difference in artistic freedom in that country versus what occurs in the United States, where cartoons and memes regularly poke fun at this country's President. Director Ziad Doueri and his co-writer Joelle Touma present an intense story of human nature that might happen anywhere, but since the leads are a Lebanese Christian and a Palestine refugee, that opening statement is warranted.One morning, a seemingly innocuous exchange between Tony (Adel Karam) and Yasser (Kamel El-Basha) takes place. While watering flowers on his balcony, the overflow sprays Yasser on the street below. Yasser, a city contractor, orders his team to fix the drainage issue, and Tony reacts violently - leading to Yasser delivering the titular insult. From there, all heck breaks loose. Apologies are requested and never delivered. Appeals to rational reconsideration are made. Tony's pregnant wife (an excellent Rita Hayek) pleads with him to let it go. Yasser's boss threatens him with termination. Still, two stubborn and prideful men refuse to give in.The subsequent courtroom drama feature other side stories, not the least of which is the relationship between the two opposing attorneys (Diamond Bou Abboud and Camile Salaheh), one a rising legal star and the other a veteran attempting to make up for a past failure. Emotions run high as two too-proud men turn what was little more than a playground standoff into a national incident being fought in the legal system and the media. Tony is a hot-head who somehow thinks an apology from Yasser is actually an apology for how Palestinians ""messed up this country"". Yasser's stoic nature barely shrouds his bitterness at the world since the Lebanon Civil War. History and childhood roots play a role, but mostly it's human nature that is at the core of this escalation.Though the title is not plural, there are multiple insults slung throughout the film, each reminding us of the power of words and the futility of the ""sticks and stones"" phrase. Our own prejudices and preconceptions alter our views and reactions, often preventing us from standing in the other fellow's shoes. Again, this situation could have played out in most any neighborhood on the globe, but this particular locale shows various ethnic and religious groups are still grappling with what it means to live together - despite the years of wars and unrest. We don't see a great deal of Middle Eastern cinema, but three days after I watched this film, it became the first ever movie from Lebanon to receive an Oscar nomination (Best Foreign Language Film) ... proving yet again that the language of cinema is universal.",negative
The Insult,"The Insult is the definition of a great cinematic achievement. It is the new movie directed by Ziad Doueiri and tells the story of Toni a Christian Lebanese who got into a fight from an insult blown out with a Palestinian plumber. Haunted by their past and the civil war, they went really far with it and the movie took unexpected turns and surprises. Doueiri and Touma wrote a splendid courtroom drama script that is really tense, exciting and really fair for the two sides. It reminded me of the great Sidney Lumet movies with a touch of political background. That film has great characters rich with backup stories and it wouldn't be great without the marvelous cast. Each actors gave an Oscar worthy performance. Thumbs up for Karam, Hayek and Diamand Bou Abboud. I must give credits to Camille Salemeh because he led the show for sure! Doueiri worked hard on letting the actors give their best for the characters. Cinematography and score were also on a high level here! Doueiri is a superb director. His debut West Beirut has always been every Lebanese's favorite. The Insult was competing in Venice (It won best actor for Kamel Basha and had a 5 minutes standing ovation), Telluride, TIFF and it the official submission for Lebanon at the Oscars for best foreign language movie. Daring, bold and smart, this movie is big step forward for the Lebanese cinema.",positive
Fukrey,"Fukrey has got its base trembling with a plot so naive, viewer discretion is recommended. Its screenplay is bit confusing for people who don't pay attention. Otherwise, it is a healthy Bollywood comedy film.Cast performance is nothing to talk about but the actors have managed to create enough chemistry between themselves. Although love doesn't come center-stage, it amuses. The music is catchy, but the lilts could've been improvised. Same theme music is used all over the 130 minutes. Cinematography, I would say, is brilliant especially shots involving mirrors. Editing is quite good.But, since the foundation itself is slimy, I rate it an AVERAGE 5.7/10. Mixing lucid dreams with reality doesn't really prove a point. The story in second half is much like Delhi Belly & other caper films where a gang try hard to please a big boss. It's a bit clichéd but the journey adopted by the Fukreys is enjoyable. They entertain and that is what matters.Dialogs are funny & straight, songs are good and overall, a fine comedy without classic cinema potential. Had expected more from the team.BOTTOM LINE: A sleeper hit that can be enjoyed once, with like-minded friends.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Fukrey,"Fukrey, directed by Mrigdeep Singh Lamba and produced by Farhan Akhtar/Ritesh Sidhwani is set in the bylanes of East Delhi and is about four youngsters who want to make it big in life - but through adopting shortcuts !Cocky Hunny(Pulkit Samrat) and goofy Choocha(Varun Sharma) are two slackers who want to get into a reputed college with the solo intention of ditching classes and ogling at girls. Accounting-phobic Laali (Manjot Singh)wants to get into this college because her lady love. Wannabe musician,Zafar(Ali Fazal)needs funds for his father's treatment. All of them need fast buck and make a deal with a wicked hustler,Bholi Punjabi(Richa Chaddha) but their adventure misfires big time when Choocha flounders.In this bizarre twist of events, how the band of boys come out unscathed forms the crux of Fukrey.Much of the film's sheen is derived from its situational humor and Mrigdeep Lamba , who made the horrendous Teen The Bhai, takes a giant leap in direction and writing with a sharp eye for details and getting the nuances of middle-class lifestyle of Delhi-ites right.The narrative is smooth and Lamba infuses some of the ROFL moments when Laali's bike parts are stolen each time outside the Gurudwara or Choocha escapes from Bholi's henchmen. Delhi Belly Dejavu !Choocha's inspection,oops I mean Inception-inspired dreams and Honey decoding them into a lottery number are sheer master-strokes !Ram Sampath's music is peppy and rustic with fresh voices and sync well with the proceedings. Ambarsariya, the traditional Punjabi folk song tops the list, with Sona Mohapatra's mellifluous renderings!The camaraderie depicted between Honey and Choocha is the heart of the enterprise and will have you in splits. Pulkit is endearing as the jugaadu-dude of the gang.His mannerisms are very typical of a Delhi boy and he gets the act right. Manjot Singh makes a solid impact with his straight-faced humor and impeccable dialogue delivery.Ali Fazal bores a serious look on his face and does justice to his character.Varun Sharma as Choocha is the scene-stealer and the real surprise package. As a debutante , he exudes ample confidence.Richa Chaddha outshines our fukras with her superb act of Bholi Punjaban and once again proves her supreme talent.Priya Anand and Vishakha Singh are adequate, and don't get much of scope in this male-dominated fare.Pankaj Tripathi,as usual,is first-rate.On the whole, Fukrey is indubitably a fresh wave of comedy with a fitting finale and a justified message to today's youth. I laughed and laughed , until my jaws ached and belly gave pangs.Worth a second time watch !Rating : 4/5",positive
The Admiral: Roaring Currents,"The fact check of the movie is completely off history. But it claims it is accurate. In actual battle, General Yi used the meticulous planning and strategy to defeat the enemy with minimal loss. The movie makes it seem like Yi wont it out of luck and courage.Actual events that are recorded in the historical document aren't even used. All turtle ships were destroyed in the previous battle but the movie wanted to make it dramatic... cheasy drama at that.Many historical records show that the Japanese fleet was 130 ships. Only one document recorded it as 300 out of mistake according to historians and the movie decided to go with that because 300 is more dramatic than 130 obviously.And there is no swirling tornado in the water. It was just fast current. The things the movie got wrong are countless. What's worse is that these fake dramas didn't make the story any more interesting. Actual history is far more interesting and dramatic.General Yi's actual battles and story is one of the most dramatic in world history. And this movie isn't it. This movie is a pure GARBAGE!",negative
The Admiral: Roaring Currents,"I am Korean and biased.In Korea, where I was growing up, Admiral Yi Sunshin was regarded someone omnipresent in everybody's life. He was not regarded as some kind of deity or a great hero. But he was regarded more like everyday household spirit (as a human). He is special in that way. He is not god, or legendary hero, but he is a person who is taking part of the greatest history of the Southern coastline. It is because he left a war diary that is ruthlessly plain and accurate and almost too dry. He was respected not only by his valour, great tactic, or special war hero characters, but he is so painfully plainly human who is sick all the time, folliwing rules, working so hard, minding other people with respect, and being practical, and tortured by his own people and yet did not give up such basic principles of life. He was respected for his personal quality and the 100% winning battle results was natural against Japanese Amadas.This movie does not depict much of his personal quality you can glimpse when you read books about him including his own diary. This movie fails to describe the people around that era and people right next to him in my opinion. Much has been altered in the modern Korean people's views. They had a totally different philosophy and view of the world then. The perception of China and Japan by Koreans were different from nowadays.What this movie succeeded in my opinion is that it for the first time tried to describe the particular battle of Myungryang with some good cinematic foundation. It is a bit corny and not perfect but overall, the battle was well studied and the combat scope was well depicted. Admiral Yi's war will be very hard to describe in pictures as he had extremely well pre-mediated plan/strategy before he engaged any sea battle. He was a perfectionist. So, it is hard to pick out all the critical elements he laied out playing his war game. He was a very serious and sophisticated person showing in military combats. So, it is not about a great hero with great anger and energy rampaging in enemy's territory with powerful fists.The movie is slow a bit and the plot is not perfect. With some errors incorporated, too. However, the battle scene itself, if you carefully watch, is interesting and the visuals are not too bad. Although, I would have preferred more CGI work.He used his life philosophy and principles in the battle ahead of weaponry and tactics. He did not give up and even with only 12 ships against over 300 ships, he made his best war strategy(not giving up again) and we can see the strategy there.It was perhaps the most amazing battle in human history and this movie manages to be close to show it. Not quite but almost. So, my score for the great effort to achieve almost impossible job.",positive
A Touch of Sin,"Nobody can deny that like all economic systems, ""Capitalism"" too is condemned time and again by filmmakers. What is important to note is that ""A Touch of Sin"" is the first serious attempt by a Chinese director to berate capitalism which is causing irreparable damages to Chinese nation especially to its ordinary population which is unable to figure out how to deal with money and its implications on a person's life. In all frankness, calling ""A Touch of Sin"" a feature-film would be a travesty of cinema as it is merely a well stitched collection of four different short films about ordinary people in China who have succumbed to pressures. Although it has been highly praised by media all over the world,this new film by Chinese director Jia Zhangke is utterly predictable and does not offer anything new. One wonders on what grounds was it selected for best screenplay prize at Cannes Film Festival 2013 ? When one leaves an independent form of filmmaking for more commercial style of filmmaking, weaknesses in the film are clearly evident. For example-There is an exaggerated scene involving a business man with a wad of currency notes who continually pummels a woman to prove his point that capitalism has not left any scope for human feelings.This scene could have used less violence but Jia Zhangke chose to dramatize it to such an extent that it became almost unbearable to watch.Lastly,this film is replete with numerous scenes of this type where ""too much"" is done in the name of sophistication at a time when ""too little"" could also have easily eased things for the film,the director and the viewers.",negative
A Touch of Sin,"I think people wrote reviews here don't actually know these 4 stories are all true stories and really happened in The modern Chinese society. The first character, Dahai, is a real serial killer,whose name is Wenhai Hu, killing 14 villiagers in Shanxi province in 2002. 
Second character, Xiaoyu, is a waitress in Hubei province and stabbed 3 local government officials. Her real name is Yujiao Deng, and she was acquitted of a charge after this scandal was brought up to the internet.
Third character, whose real name is Kehua Zhou, was another serial robber killing strangers and taking their bags. He was shot down by the police near his hometown.
The last character is a reflection of the suicided employees of Foxconn, the biggest manufacturer of IPhone. It was reported that from 2010 to 2012, there were several employees of Foxconn jumped off the roof due to the heavy workload and military-like management.

Infini,"I watched this movie after somebody said it's similar to Event Horizon. Is it? Well, it's in the same vein, using inter-dimensional travel to create the horror of ""unknown"".. but the ""horror"" isn't really that horrifying.Don't get me wrong, it's still far more competent and entertaining than the pile of sh*t that Prometheus and Alien: Covenant were. Just don't expect it to match Event Horizon.Primarily because, like with most directors/writers, in Infini, they make the mistake of trying to explain too much. Even bigger mistake is to show the enemy itself, but then it'd have to be a psychological horror, which this ain't.Also, I would've preferred they had ended the movie when the hero ""wakes up"" (not a spoiler) instead of them showing more. It'd left the ending up the interpretation, like they say they wanted to.. but I don't think it does. Kinda explains pretty clearly what happened and who changed and why. Kinda disappointed in that.Oh well, still a good movie. Worth watching.",negative
Infini,"I gave this two stars. One day this man that was in his second year studying Philosophy decided he wants to become a painter, but somehow manages to get into Film School instead. He's also slightly autistic. So yeah - he made a movie called ""Infini"". More than half of the movie I did not understand what they were talking about. Endless scenes that should't be there bored me to death. By the end of it I was getting restless and just wanted to gouge my eyes out already. There's something really wrong about this movie. I can't put my finger on it but I think the dialog is all messed up. Words keep coming out of the actor's mouth and they are not gibberish but by the end of the phrase you have absolutely no idea what has been said, what purpose does it serve or how exactly do those words help the viewer understand what is going on on the screen.",positive
Graduation,"Cristian Mungiu is considered one of the fathers of New Romanian Cinema, with his 4 MONTHS, 3 WEEKS AND 2 DAYS abortion drama being the most famous to come out after the fall of the Soviet Union. Mungiu is more cinematic than some of the directors of the movement (his last movie, BEYOND THE HILLS was a devil possession tale), although still austere.The superb GRADUATION builds along slowly, but deliberately. In the end, the movie is about corruption, but, the steps it takes seem as minor as an offhand conversation here, a nod there. But, that's how things work in a corrupt society. GRADUATION may not quite build to the level of the brilliant Russian film LEVIATHAN, but, they share a quietly devastating portrayal of the bankruptcy of the old Soviet system. Sadly, that system seems to have been replaced in name only.",negative
Graduation,"Films rarely put forward leading characters that they then choose to vehemently punish throughout. But this is Mungiu, who has already proved more than adept at creating authentic and ruthless portrayals of society and in Bacalaureat he scrapes at the edges of our souls. His tale of generational change is predicated on the dismantling of a profoundly patriarchal state of being. To this purpose, he crafts a story of remarkable complexity and depth, which cuts across so many layers, that taking them apart would be counterproductive.In short: Eliza is sexually assaulted one day before her 'bacalaureat', the final set of high-school exams students sit in Romania. She had been awarded a conditional scholarship at a university in the UK, but her impairment, both mental and physical, poses a threat to her getting the grades she needs. Cue in the father, Romeo, a local doctor, whose life is about to encounter quite the upheaval in his desire to ensure Eliza fulfills his own botched 'destiny' of leaving the country. Things take a turn for the complicated as he is more or less inadvertently offered an opportunity to guarantee the results his daughter needs. The circuit of corruption is as informal as it is intricate - a friend of a friend situation, one hand washes the other kind of thing. And beyond all this mess, Romeo also has to keep up the facade of his marriage, while dating a single mother, Sandra, who happens to be a teacher at Eliza's high-school. What makes Bacalaureat instantly and distinctively good is the attention to detail, which breeds both familiarity and authenticity. But unlike Mungiu's previous major success, 4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days, the grimness does not stem from the subject matter, or the dry (non-)stylization of the story, but from how intertwined the many strands of this one case prove to be. Shadowing the father along it is painful because his shortcomings are obvious from afar. But it is his demise that is so important to ensure a new generation comes along which will set itself apart from the current one. He is tragic, because not only can he not escape his destiny, but he doesn't recognize his role in propagating that which he abhors. Romeo's willingness to compromise in order to ensure his daughter's chance of being the change he desires is part of the hereditary disease plaguing any such social construction. Taking a wider view, it isn't coincidental that every moral-institutional junction is safeguarded by a man - a doctor, a police officer, a former mayoral figure, a school commissioner, a prosecutor. Contrasting this are the female characters, the strength of Eliza, the stoicism of Sandra, the wisdom of Romeo's wife, Magda. It's a battle of utilitarian and deontological ethics, posing the question of whether moral pragmatism can be moral at all. There is little doubt where Mungiu sides, as the male 'keywardens' are at least one of: cynical, unfeeling, self-serving, hypocritical. Masculine instincts are both highlighted ('it wasn't a rape, it was just a sexual assault!') and criticized. Even as it seems that a pair of male characters come along that are understanding and humane, there is a strong pinch of self-interest that dictates terms, which is why they are punished with a fine ironic touch by the director.For all that happens, there are two scenes which summarize the journey we are on. Firstly, when 'someone' (life?) throws a stone at the apartment Romeo's family is living in, thereby breaking a window, he rushes out confidently, as if finding the culprit were a matter of when, rather than if. Then, towards the end of the film, as Romeo's life unravels by the virtue of his poor choices, he decides to venture after the assumed perpetrator of the assault on his daughter; now, however, he loses the trail instantly, finds himself wandering confused in the shadows of apartment buildings, jumping at every unexpected noise coming his way. The grip, the control over how society is run, ever loosening.If anything, I would criticize Mungiu for being overly and overtly moralistic. There are several moments where characters are used as props to portray said moral perspectives, scenes which feel artificial and pedagogically pedantic. Also, the bureaucratic coldness conveyed by almost all officials (one moment dictating an official statement concerning Eliza's rape, the next discussing trivialities) feels uninspiring by now - there is a sense that themes are contained within a national frame, that our sole focus is alleviating the burdens of the past, more than the challenges of the present. And although this is hinted at during the film, the matter of exam fraud was as rooted as it is illustrated here about ten years ago, when I myself was finishing high-school. Hence, it feels against the times in a way, but then this can also be viewed as the last vestiges of an era, Romeo's solution being retrograde especially in such a light.Bickering aside, creating such a complex and highly integrated story that feels true to itself almost all the way is quite splendid indeed. It's not an easy ride for viewers, who will suffer the pain of compromise, of systemic contortion against the individual - ultimately, Romeo has good intentions, the world just seems to require of him to do what he does, to right a wrong with a wrong. Yet, it remains the individual that decides, which is why the 'bacalaureat' is such an important stepping stone for change and for maturity. Mungiu's film is a comment on the precipice we are finding ourselves on now, where we see the change more clearly, are even enacting it, but it is the follow-up that will define us as a people, as a generation. Funnily enough, he proves to be an optimist.",positive
Last Love,"1st off Michael is a widower, American living in Pars, a Philosophy Professor who was of course teaching at a top ivy league college. No one can teach in the Univ of Penn, or Michigan. Get tenure at any decent college is challenging. His accent is awful. really awful. Like an English is a 2nd language person who speaks good English. Couldn't he be an Englishman, who married an American and went to USA to teach. How come no one notices the bad accent, when casting and showing 1st scenes. Michael is a seasoned professional, didn't he listen to himself?There are other problems, with the characters and the plot development. but I prefer not to give any spoilers.it really is rather slow- and very sentimental (which means melodramatic, over the top)not a spoiler, but for instance, Parisian Clemence speaks very good English, but Micheal corrects her a few times, which would be understandable for someone who didn't speak well. For instance ""faites"" in French, is making or doing, so English could be doing or making depending on the action. She explained she speaks English well because her father, who she was close to, was American. so if she grew up speaking, she would know the correct English verb & phrases. Someone thought this ""charming""interlude should go into the dialogue, not 1X but 3X.it kind of meandered, so that I didn't know where they were going. Not a good thing.While sure, the Widower missed the love of his life, only gone 3 years, but these too many wonky scenes with him talking to his dead wife, didn't make for a good story.",negative

She is the most backwash actress of Bellwood, fake, show off and I hate her presence on celluloid.So kindly spare us.From the cinematic horror.Only neerja bhanot's mom character moved me by her acting skills.I hope from next time film makers will get real actors on the board than this actress",negative
Neerja,"Life has to be bigger not longer! The film, Neerja is a portrayal on the life of the courageous Neerja Bhanot, who sacrificed her life while protecting the lives of 359 passengers in 1986. The flight was hijacked by a terrorist organization in Karachi. How she bravely handled the situation is what the film has been made on.Director is the real hero of this movie. Ram Madhvani describes every part, every scene of the film very wonderfully. Along with the writers, he is not giving outside of the track and thus, this film is a gem of 2016! Shabana Azmi has done a fantabulous job in the character of Neerja's mother. Though, she has not much dialogues, but her expressions show her emotions, and they are very real that everyone was crying literally. When she gave a speech on Neerja in the end, I was not able to control my emotions. Tears were flowing continuously. She will be the winner of best supporting actress in the major award ceremony undoubtedly.Sonam Kapoor has given career best performance. She could've been portrayed her well. But, whatever she has given is acceptable. Yogendra Tikku as Neerja's father and Shekhar as Neerja's friend are good and suitable. The man who portrayed Khalil, the angriest terrorist, has done a fantastic job. He looks like a pure terrorist. Others are good, too.Music is given by Vishal Khurana and lyrics has been penned by Prasoon Joshi. All the songs are listenable again and again. Background score is also suitable and helps to build the terror as well as the excitement.Connection with Rajesh Khanna, Neerja's past describing her marriage issue, her father's advises, her handling of the passengers, her smartness of not taking the U.S. citizens' passports, her calmness, her love letter written by her lover, her love towards her duty, her sacrifice - everything is just so perfect. I'm no getting over from it. This is probably one of the best films of this year.I salute you from the bottom of my heart to Neerja Bhanot, the actual one. She has been rewarded Ashok Chakra by the government of India. Though, Airlift was a good one, but, this deserves support from the audience. This is definitely better than Airlift. Please, it's my humble request to all that go and watch out the story of the brave girl, Neerja. Her mother told that Neerja was prettier than Sonam. Yes, the photographs in the end credits give the approval to this statement. A girl, aged 23, lost her life while saving the passengers during her job.

Kapoor & Sons,"Lot's of people and critics are praising about this movie. Some are saying that this is the best of this year up till now. But, frankly speaking, I'm not agree with these kind of statements or even these kind of positive reviews of this movie. Director Shakun Batra, who earlier directed Ek Main Aur Ek Tu, which was not a hit, comes back with this family drama. I must say it is far better than the previous one. The major plus point is the screenplay. Scenes have been written so well. Because of that, the shooting schedule had been completed in a shorter time, I guess. Actors are good. Location is suitable. Background score is perfect. And I think, because of the number of twists and turns is more in the post interval part, critics loved this film. But, I want to ask them, what about the boring portions in the first half!? Alia Bhatt is as cute as she looks earlier in her films. Sidharth Malhotra lacks in acting in some scenes. And I heard this statement from many viewers. Rajat Kapoor is good. Rishi Kapoor is funny and adorable. His make-up is the only time-taking thing in the whole movie. Two factors that affect the movie are Fawad Khan and Ratna Pathak Shah. She is the best actor of this movie. And for Fawad, if you please don't consider his character, haha, I like him. He looks hot and charming and stylish. So, a hero material has been found. He will go far and up. Chul song is a waste of time for me. Two background songs are good. Comedy is fine. Bhajan in iPad, Mandakini the heroine, the plumber asking for the money- these are my favorite comic scenes. So, I think this film is a one time watch. As I've seen Pyar Ka Punchnama 2 as an overrated movie last year, this movie stands for this category in this year. On the whole, I am confuse about what I get from the film. So the praising audience, who find out the meaning of life and relationships from this film, can you help me",negative

Rurouni Kenshin Part II: Kyoto Inferno,"The first live-action installment of Rurouni Kenshin judiciously cut several arcs from the original manga and anime story to deliver a tight, cohesive narrative that built up to a satisfying conclusion — even if it did reveal a few late-story secrets far, far too early. The first half of a two-part follow-up, Rurouni Kenshin: Kyoto Inferno (a.k.a. Kyoto Taika-hen) suffers by failing to take the same discretion with the source material, choosing instead to mirror the manga's episodic, drawn- out build-up to the decisive confrontation between Himura Kenshin (Takeru Sato, a former Kamen Rider) and Makoto Shishio (Tatsuya Fujiwara of Battle Royal and Deathnote fame). This film could easily have worked as a televised miniseries, with a sense of minor resolution every twenty minutes or so as a greater, unifying threat loomed in the background. But as a singular arc, Rurouni Kenshin: Kyoto Inferno lacks any cohesive build or pay-off as Kenshin wanders from one seemingly arbitrary encounter to the next. A plea for help. An assassinated official. A stolen sword. A village in peril. A search for a swordsmith. A plot to burn Kyoto. A desperate rescue. An open-ended conclusion. And between each burst of choreographed violence, a ream of static exposition that would nearly send George Lucas looking for an editor.The story partly suffers from its need to play clean-up to some first- film decisions. Hajime Saito (Yosuke Eguchi) has already been introduced as an unambiguous ally, and although he's allowed to display more badassery this time around, the film lacks the taut-wire tension between Kenshin and the ex-Shinsen Gumi leader that formed the backbone of the manga's sensational Kyoto arc (Saito's opening face-to-face with Shishio is also a bit silly, largely resembling an outtake from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom). The film also struggles to introduce Aoshi Shinomori (Yusuke Iseya, who was interesting in Casshern back in 2004). While wisely excluded from the first film — another semi-villain would have just been too much — cramming all of his development into an expository sub-story this time around fails to do justice to one of the series' most compelling characters. By the time he faces off with Kashiwazaki Nenji (Min Tanaka), the ostensible leader of the Oniwa Banshu ninja group (translated here as The Watchers), we really haven't had time to get to know him or care about his goals.One standout, however, is Tao Tsuchiya, who's delightful to watch as Oniwa Banshu ninja Makimachi Misao. While her attempts at anime-style spunk don't quite work, her full-throttle wire-assisted combat displaces enough bamboo to evoke positive memories of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Ryunosuke Kamiki (voice of Bo in Spirited Away and Marukuru in Howl's Moving Castle) similarly sets up an effectively creepy Sojiro Seta, though in a film crammed with so many new characters, we don't quite get to know who he is so much as simply what he does.As for the remainder of the supporting cast from the first film, they are almost entirely cut from the runtime, appearing only during Kenshin's should-I-go-to-Kyoto quandary at the opening and then again at the end. This leaves Kenshin meandering the middle arc as an arbitrary avenger, with only an incidental connection to the travesties Shishio creates around him — and repeated scenes of women and children weeping extravagantly over dead bodies feels more desperate than driving. With Sato's portrayal of Kenshin predominantly set to glower, we don't get a clear sense of the radical shift between his carefree and killer states, and it's unclear which moments truly resonate with the reformed assassin.The action sequences are exceptionally well-choreographed, and generally fun to watch. But with so many featuring hero-vs-the-world stuntman slaughter, tension is quickly lost. While there are fits of incidental action, there are only two big one-on-one fights for the title character, and the second, though Bourne-like in its innovative use of tight spaces, involves an antagonist we barely know and who only serves to mechanically set up the next plot point (He's also done up a little too ridiculously for a live-action villain — another area where deviation from the source material would have been wise). Taken on the whole, the film feels like watching only the first quarter of Kill Bill Volume 1 stretched to 139 minutes. Much sound and fury, signifying little — and even a citywide battle in the penultimate arc seems arbitrary and unearned. Having gone through so many unrelated minor objectives, the stakes are unclear and the emotional investment isn't there. Perhaps this will all be put paid in the second half, promised in September. But until then, this Rurouni Kenshin feels long on tease and short on delivery.(Disclosure: I got to play the first plummeting body in the video for One OK Rock's Mighty Long Fall, the film's closing theme.)",negative
Rurouni Kenshin Part II: Kyoto Inferno,"I am deeply surprised. I was expecting a really bad adaptation, as it has been done before. This movie however is great. If you grew up watching the anime you will be pleased, as it brings to life the right personality of the characters. They even have that goofiness Himura always showed whenever he was surrounded by the ones he loved. But shifting right back to some cold heart determined killer that awarded him his nickname. The fighting scenes, were tremendous. None of that ""shaking camera"" BS that Hollywood vomits on us. Really well done.The filming and editing are sublime. I could easily notice on one of the big fights (wont spoil it for you), the still burning ashes floating around the scene, giving me instant flashbacks to the anime. Really nice touch. And the opening scene of Shishio and Saito is tremendous.The action is great. Himura is perfectly portrayed, with all of his goofy nuances, deep honor, shame, guilt, and killer instinct. And the same can be said of the remaining characters. Sanosuke is as obnoxious and lovable as ever. And Sojiro is perfectly depicted in his psychopath childish assassin persona. I feel like i could show this movie to people that have never seen the anime, and they would still love it. Great work guys.",positive
Witching and Bitching,"A stupid movie absolutely not funny.

Don't watch if you have a brain.
Nothing There.",negative
Witching and Bitching,"This fast paced, Spanish film is simultaneously a really disturbing horror tale, a meditation on the battle of the sexes, and one of the funniest movies I've seen in years. Things get off to a lightning start with a holdup of a gold buying emporium in downtown Madrid by criminals posing as living statues with a critical assist provided by a ten year old accomplice, one of the wildest film heist scenes I've ever seen and worth the price of admission alone. Seriously, you'll never forget the sight of a gold painted Jesus sprinting for his life while toting a little kid who's shooting back two handed at the police.A beginning like that would be hard to surpass, but W&B continues to pile it on under Alex de la Iglesia's masterful direction. Having commandeered a cab whose driver willingly agrees to assist them, the criminals try to flee north to France to escape the law and to fulfill the promise made by the leader, José (Hugo Silva), to take his son to Disneyworld in Paris, with the police and José's divorced wife in hot pursuit. Already a tense situation for the hapless thieves, things take a decided turn for the weird and the worse when they reach the witch infested town of Zugarramurdi, in the heart of Basque country. Led by a three generation family (the oldest witch reminded me of Grandmama from the Addams Family), the witches capture the thieves with malign designs upon them, namely to use the men as sacrifices to restore an oppressive matriarchy.The pace rarely lets up and the jokes fly fast and furious, interspersed with over the top, gross out scenes of gore. The men lament their inability to get along with women only to find themselves trapped in a decaying mansion (is there any other kind in a horror movie?) by a bunch of smiling, evil, literal witches who want to torture, kill, and eat them. They fight back as best they can, but their fates ultimately depend upon the attraction felt by the youngest witch in the family (well played by the stunningly beautiful Carolina Bang) for bumbling José. The climactic scene of a Witches' Sabbath simply has to be seen to be believed, but I won't give away any spoilers.About the only real criticism I have of this film is the English title, which I don't think accurately conveys what the film's about. The Spanish title, Las Brujas De Zugarramurdi, The Witches Of Zugarramurdi, was apparently a non-starter due to the long, difficult Basque place name. This minor cavil aside, this was a crackerjack movie, absolutely entertaining from start to finish.I recommend this film to horror fans who don't mind comedy mixed in with the scares (some horror fans are big purists that way) and anybody who likes a good laugh in general, although I will provide the trigger warning that this is not for anyone with a weak stomach.",positive
Synchronicity,"I was quite shocked to see how low the rating was on this film, and I can only imagine it is because people struggled to keep a grasp on a self entwined looping plot. This is a wormhole based movie, so expect it to be a bit loopy.Probably don't watch it with a girlfriend/wife who isn't in to this genre (they'll not enjoy it and will wreck it for you to by asking for explanations continually... and that would be distracting on a complicated plot which moves fairly swiftly), and it would be best enjoyed without beer (you do need to concentrate to keep up), but other than that I found it excellent. Visually nice, the music was quite 'daft punk'/Tron in places (good on a home cinema system), the actors could act, the female lead was sexy and they tied all the pieces together. What more could you ask for. My 10/10 is probably a bit excessive, I put it this high to try and offset the people who don't understand and have been slating it. In reality it is a solid 8.7/10: not perfect, but getting close.",negative
Synchronicity,"I'm giving it 10 stars because the movie was far better by the end than I thought it would be at the start. From the start though our cinematic sensibilities pick up quickly that there is not an ""Independence Day"" budget attached. With a slew of time-travel themed movies recently relying on great story telling and acting and others on big budgets and vacuous stars I wasn't sure where this one would fall but immediately one was struck by it's style. A noir look and compelling soundtrack. But as the recursive story picked up - well written and a fine cast - any misgivings were forgotten. This is an original story with not just fine twists but also perhaps a first in the time travel genre it's quite sexy. Great chemistry between the two main characters added up to a compelling tale that crossed interestingly between lust and science. Not since Forbidden Planet haha joking but the soundtrack again is worth mentioning and will make a second viewing as enjoyable as the first. Sci-fi has been burdened by the heavy handed scores of John Williams for far too long. Ben Lovett provides a beautifully apt real si-fi soundtrack to a real sci-fi film.Don't be misled by simplistic reviewers, it is a quite clever concoction of ideas but spread out across it's time frame with all the right moments well embedded the story is well told.Jacob Gentry is a person of future interest.",positive
Vada Chennai,"As the title reads, the characters in the movie also are complicated because of love. Love for the power, love for the people, love for status and love for money. And as the lead character name itself is Anbu(meaning love) how can his life be simpler. Part 1 is mainly focused on how 'Anbu' is dragged into the world of darkness. The Staging of scenes are done very realistically, which even more boost up the intensity of the film. Director does his best job by portraying the actual rawness of the place.Talking about the camera work for the first few minutes, the camera movement was very visible but later as film goes on, the camera movement becomes static which gives a essence of looking through the eye of the characters in the movie. The Beauty of the film is the action sequence, it is precisely choreographed. And talking about the background music, it just blends with visual. On whole the film is engaging with all the aspects of life, the love sequences of the film doesn't disturb the engaging narration, instead it makes it even more better, this is the best part of the film.
More than a film about gangster, it is film about life.
The cast of the film did their best work.
The one reason which holds the film back is the 'A rated' certificate which keeps away many people from going to the theatre.",negative
Vada Chennai,"This movie has been in the making for a decade or more and its totally worth it and understandable! Every character, scene, dialogue means something and its so well etched that you have to accept it sets a benchmark for regional cinema.
It is comparable to all the great gangster dramas that world has produced like the untouchables, godfather, and our own nayagan, satya and gangs of wasseypur. Amusing that directors find their best work in describing crime from its origin to effect.Yes, this movie describes a reluctant young man's journey through the slums surrounded by crooks eventually into a leader and ganglord and is inspired by all those movies listed above.
What stood out were few things among many, how the director has given attention to detail right from cinematography to dialogue to time period it feels as if the tale is unscripted, the superb acting from all the cast led by Dhanush, the editing which deserves multiple awards for carrying out non linear story telling with aplomb, the music which is not jarring and giea with the flow and above all the direction which is a cut above the rest taking the best out if his crew Vetri maaran gives his best work here.Enjoy the intensity, political satire (for eg when a character asks if rajiv gandhi succeeded mgr as prime minister) the lawlessness, the dilemma of who or what is right and wrong, is it all by design or free will and many other uncomfortable questions.You will definitely root for the lead character and have many moments with tears in your eyes and lump in your throat!",positive
When Harry Met Sejal,"I watched the movie with my wife yesterday and it started randomly with Shahrukh trying to over act tourist guide life. Suddenly he meets one more dumbo ""Sejal"" who leaves her fiancé to find some ring and travels all around Europe with reluctant Shahrukh. Finally they fall in love. Seriously thats the gist and including this it has over acting of shahrukh , Dumbness of Anushka, Silly Jokes.What were you thinking about it Mr Imtiaz Ali.. This movie should be banned from theatres as it is having lots of negative Effect of human Values and thoughts.. In fact this has actually caused me overnight headache . Probably this movie should come with a complimentary DISPRIN and psychologist appointments.If this movie is Love Story in your definition, then probably go back to 90's and start over. Shahrukh Khan - Please STOP here. I have loved your movies in 90's , but now its not selling. I bet even you would not watch this for 2:30 mins..",negative
When Harry Met Sejal,"What happened to Shahrukh from Chak De India and Swadesh? That Shahrukh who used to do good movies like that and now he keeps churning out bad movies back to back. Can anyone call that old Shahrukh and send this new Shahrukh to whatever hellhole he came from!? This movie is no different from his earlier movies he has done before, it's not even an original movie but a copy of Hollywood romantic classic ""When Harry met Sally"". They will tell you it's different..yeah, right! If Shahrukh is not going to do a original movie and copy-paste some movie and then at least do it properly...you had one job for god sake!!!Shakrukh is 51 years old but still he is doing romantic movies, he should start doing movies which suits his age. In this movie, he is playing a lover boy who is in his 20s-30s. He looks more like a grandfather of Anushka than her love interest. Shahrukh did an overacting as usual, just horrible horrible like he is suffering from seizure which is coming every one minute. If that's not his acting and that's how he has became in real life, then he should check those seizures out from a doctor, my sympathy for him and although, sometimes Anushka does an amazing job but in this, she has those expressions in her face which makes me want to punch her. I think that has to do with her botched lip surgery, that's why she can't emote and speak properly. While they travels the world together in this movie, they should go to a doctor together too.What to say about this movie? Nothing new, just another one where boy meet girl, girl meet boy and then they eventually fall in love with each other like we haven't seen clichés like this which has been rehashed like 5677234556 times. The movie was so awful that I should be given some kind of award for managed to sit throughout the end. Firstly I don't find the story enjoyable. To make a whole film about two people meeting through various stages of their lives and slowly, or should I say very slowly, starting a relationship is boring. Secondly I did not find anything funny. I was looking for some laughs, but it turned to be a total dud, like it's trying too hard to be funny. I could not focus on the film and whatever story there was in it, because dialogues were mostly forced and unnecessarily long. Maybe this is poor writing, maybe poor editing, but in any case, it resulted in a film that is hard to watch. What happened to the directer like Imtiaz Ali like his mind was too distracted while making this movie.You will only like this movie if you are too blinded by love for Shahrukh that you refuse to see any fault in his movie. They won't even agree with my review too like I'm not allowed to give an constructive criticism like you can see how they are giving this movie 9-10. I bet most of them haven't even seen the movie. Then again, it's the case with most of the Shahrukh movies where fake up voting is necessary so that general public can't see how piece of crap his movies are actually are. So watch this movie if you're a Shahrukh fan and if you are neutral like I am, then prepare to be disappointed AGAIN!!!!!",positive
Ae Dil Hai Mushkil,"This is not just a bad film but a disgrace to film industry. Karan Johar, you just buried the Indian Cinema deep down the grave.Initial bit of the movie is obnoxious! Lame acting, silly comedy, same old dialogues and irritating acting. Here they make a mockery of love and relationships where people sleep around and just jump between partners. Then comes and love part which fails to delivery the gravity.Later comes Aishwarya, which is the only watchable section. This section delivers some good acting and the story starts to move. And then it stalls very badly immediately. Well, the Sharukh Khan scene is pretty good. Am not his fan but the entire movie sucks so bad that his acting feels better.The worst section is the cancer part. OMG what a disaster! Super insult to the cancer patients. These so called stars of bollywood are so naive, they don't even want to shave their heads for the role but wear a bald wig! How convenient. No struggle of cancer established and Anushka looks like an alien in that wig.Her head is bald because of cancer but her eyebrows and eyelashes are in-tact. Bravo! Karan, are you serious?Karan is so obsessed with himself, the movie has so many unwanted irksome KKHH and KANH tunes forcibly added into it, gosh so horrible. Is this your mature filmmaking?And then you see these English and French people enjoying all Hindi songs these actors have to sing. There is a scene where Ranbir is singing a Hindi song with his so called band in a Church, lolSo many better filmmakers don't even get a chance to complete or initiate their film projects and such filthy rich ones fool people with such horrific movies. Karan has lost it. Twinkle made a good choice!!Please don't watch it even if someone puts a gun to your head. Take the shot, at least its quick!!",negative
Ae Dil Hai Mushkil,"First of all, let me clear one fact- I am not a Ranbir Kapoor fan. If you were expecting some typical karan johar/Bollywood drama, this is not the one for you. I would request everyone to first watch and UNDERSTAND this film rather than commenting negatively. Please watch the film rather than listening to people around you and then decide for yourself. The Review: The movie is a mirror image of a modern, high class societal life. Probably the single screen audience(and maybe some of the urban audiences as well) can never relate to it. You desire to love someone but never receive any reciprocation. How would you feel? What would you do to overcome the pain? How would you make the person realize that your love is true, eternal and important? This movie is all about that. There are some direction errors but Ranbir's terrific performance makes up for all the faults. Maybe a lesser number of songs would have helped but come-on, all of them were soothing for the ears. Some people complained about the intimate scenes and said they it was not appropriate for family audience. But isn't it the reality(and come on, the trailer depicted some of them so if you felt inappropriate you shouldn't have come)? Everyone have delivered some terrific performances- Anushka as the bubbly and trying to be carefree girl(but actually caring from heart) and Aishwarya as an experienced woman, one who has seen life and is keenly looking for true love etc. The emotions manage to strike your heart(A few people among the audience sitting before us cried after the movie got over). If this is not considered to be a good movie, I don't know what is...",positive
Ittefaq,I am big fan of crime investigation movie and television series and I was expecting something like primal fear or unusual suspects but this is totally crap. I would like to prefer crime patrol(Indian crime investigation television series) over this and amazed by IMDb rating of this movie.Biggest flaw of this movie that police was not interested in victims or suspects phone records.How could they ?? Phone records are most important part any case investigation.Crime patrol police are much better because they start investigation with victims and suspects phone records.Its is good to watch Akshay Khanna (as emotional cop )on screen but criminal tricks him every time (remember deewangee). This movie does not justify thriller or mystery title for sure.,negative
Ittefaq,"Movie start with car accident and rest in suspense whole movie is well made with thriller, every is interconnected with each other, lead actor performance was very good, specially akshaye khanna every one even the character in small role do their job perfectly, visuals, cinematography, direction, all are good in short well made movie say no to spoilers!",positive
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag,I don't really do this but I'd like to make an exception in this case. The movie is excellent. Great way of story telling. The story is about one man but he is not the only one who plays the role exceedingly well. After watching this I don't think any one who acted in this film was remotely bad. They all acted amazingly well and gave true justice to their own characters. Only drawback that i can mention here is the time. i think the movie is a bit too long. For the first 2 and half hours i didn't really feel the need to look at my watch.Overall a refreshing film with excellent story and great acting.,negative
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag,"Well I was not excited enough for this movie, but when the trailers started coming and then the music, my curiosity began to flourish little bit. But the main reason I went to saw this movie was because I heard almost 50-60 review from my friends and not even single person had a negative review against it. And when I saw this, it really blew me away because it had many mixtures which made this movie work. First of all FARHAN AKHTER is at its best, no doubt its his best performance till date. It was like we were seeing real Milkha Singh on screen. Divya Dutta is awesome, Pavan Malhotra, Yograj Singh & Prakash Raj have really performed well. Sonam Kapoor is completely waste though her role was very little, so you won't miss her. Rebecca Breeds looks fabulous, Dilip Tahil as Jawahar Lal Nehru was not a master stroke. Screenplay was good, music was fabulous and the background score really kept the life in each and every scene. Rakesh Omprakash Mehra's best work till date also. YOU DARE TO MISS THIS ONE ON YOUR OWN RISK !!!",positive
Happy New Year,"I had expected a lot from this movie due to the cast it had and the publicity they did, but I had wasted my money, time and mind when I watched the movie. This movie has awful story. Comedy in the movie is nice. The vfx of the movie were nice, but the story could be made awesome, just due to story I gave the movie just one rating. I was not having a vehicle with me, I went with my family and I had to stay even after intermission. It is a hit just because of the cast and comedy ONLY. I actually had an headache after watching the movie. I don't know where is the old Sharukh who had made hits like Swades, Chak de India etc, where ever he is, I hope he comes back soon. I miss you SRK. :(",negative
Happy New Year,"What has happened to Bollywood? Directors such as Farah Khan bank on the star power of SRK/Deepika and other stars to earn rs300cr+ at the BO and what they deliver in return is a shitty/crappy/non sense/unfunny movie filled with slapstick humor, gay jokes, mediocre acting, ABS, and no logic whatsoever. I love to watch movie and I am myself a great fan of Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Manmohan Desai, their movies may not be completely logical but were entertaining and had emotions. But the joke is current directors are making high budget crappy movies with bland humor mentioning that its an inspiration to iconic directors of the past and making loads of money at the BO. I am sure HNY will be the highest grossing movie ever and Farah Khan will be one of the best director in Bollywood history, but me as an audience is left completely disappointed and cheated. HNY is the best heist movie ever since it is going the rob the Indian audience of their hard earned money in the name of entertainment.",positive
The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia,"Firstly, why this is called The Haunting in Connecticut 2 is a mystery as it has nothing whatsoever to do with the first movie.If you want a scary ghost story, steer well clear of this mess. A ghost pops up within about 2 mins of the opening and then throughout the entire film....constant....relentless flickering ghosts, shot for some reason in sepia. It wasn't enough to have one person who can see these ""ghosts"" either. No, we are treated to all three lead female characters having persistent visions for the entire 1hr 40mins. To claim this is based on a true story is almost insulting. To start with the ""true"" Wyrick story is a typical kid sees ghost affair, not particularly chilling (or true for that matter). By the end of this film it's nothing more than a ridiculous monster flick, with the character played by Abigail Spencer running and squealing around a standard creepy cellar filled with (shock horror) all manner of taxidermy and about 20 ghosts in tow.The concept of the underground slave railroad run by the evil taxidermist station master is a baffling plot line, which completely ruined the film. God knows what they were thinking.The acting from the little girl, Emily Alyn Lind is about the only redeeming feature. Chad Michael Murray was completely pointless, giving an unconvincing and lacklustre performance. The rest of the cast were okay, nothing spectacular, and of course 90% of the cast were mute ghostly types who just stand about in corners, looking over people's shoulders with a pained expression, and pointing into the woods.AVOID.",negative
The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia,"I didn't want to see this. I didn't care about it. My daughter wanted to see it and was afraid she would become scared so I watched it with her. I cannot believe how wrong I was. This movie was excellent. The premise is NOT silly, or stupid, and it is not scary or gory. What it is, is quite frightening and the story line is believable and this may be the one ""Based on a true story"" horror movie that actually is based on a true story. The story line is also very interesting and rich in actual history that my daughter enjoyed and so did I. I really can't even believe it was as good as it was. Unfortunately, the ONLY reason I gave it a 9 is the name is kinda dumb. My daughter was like A haunting in Connecticut 2: ghosts of Georgia...ummm why isn't it just named a haunting in Georgia or ghosts of Georgia...lol Please go see this and enjoy it.",positive
One Chance,"Starting with the movie synopsis, he was NEVER an opera singer 'by night' throughout the entire movie, and only sang for an operatic company near the end of the film when even then he only sang in the beginning of Aida until he went unconscious due to his stupidity which he demonstrates throughout the movie. It is disrespectful to those of us who have struggled against the odds to become something we truly wanted to be by implying he did the same. The only reason he even entered the contest at the end was because his wife was at her wits end with his lack of motivation to sing, although the movie does make it clear that he was well motivated to eat. Ironically, it is implied that his obesity was the main reason he was harassed while growing up, and only those who feel pity for him because of this would see some kind of justification for his eventual success in spite of his gullet.",negative
One Chance,"I saw the film One Chance prior to it's official USA opening, at the Aspen Film Festival, where it received enthusiastic applause and cheering from the audience. Although I am a long-time fan of its subject, British operatic tenor Paul Potts, it is not just ""good if you like Paul Potts"" but really, really good for anyone. Tony-award winner James Corden is excellent as Paul Potts, as is the rest of the cast, and the film is a first-class production all round. It is heartwarming and inspirational--and humorous--as it tells the story of a man who was born with an immense talent but bullied all his life for being ""different."" It is full of gorgeous music and full of romance as it follows the story of Paul and his wife, through difficulties--almost unbelievable, except it's true--that almost forced him to give up his dream, until it all came down to just One Chance to make his dreams come true. I would give it more than ""two thumbs up"" if I had more thumbs!",positive
Special 26,Finally 2013 has its first Awesome movie. Its been an year with all crappy movies so far. Special 26 steals the show easily.The characters and actors have been so well chosen. Each actor has got the perfect character. The casting could not have been better than this. The direction is superb. So is the Art Direction. The story does not lag anywhere. So its a superb story with some really good editing.Talking about actors -Akshay Kumar - comes out of his day to day roles of khiladi and joker stuff. This is serious cinema which makes him a complete actor.Anupam Kher - reminds everyone that he is still very much the same awesome actor as the one in 90s.Jimmy Sheirgill - chooses the right kind of role finally. He perfectly fits the role of SI Ranvir Singh and also fits well in the 1987 plot.Manoj Bajpai - as good as ever. Special 26 ka CBI inspector Waseem Khan is as good as Wasseypur ka Sardar Khan.Kavya - hardly any role for her. Shes in the movie for songs only.Divya Dutta - standard supportive role. does well.Others - very well done.Art direction for Delhi steals the show. the 1987 Delhi has been brought alive. details have been worked out well. 1987 Mumbai disappointed. I guess it was very tough to recreate that so the director and the VFX team chose the green screen. Thats the shoddiest part of the movie and hence i gave the 9/10 and not a full tenner.Verdict : The movie can definitely been seen more than once at a theater if you get the tickets. It is gonna be a houseful for some days.,negative
Special 26,"You don't need almost 832 twists in a script to make it look slick and classical thriller. Neeraj Pandey proved it with Special 26. AND one more thing : All PANDEYz of bollywood please stay aside as this PANDEY is something extraordinary with his hand on script and direction. lets move back to film. film starts with a bang (Heist) which stuns you more because of body language of characters and the direction (ofcourse background score should get the praise too) film moves to some rom-com plot suddenly but without making you bore. First half was good but when the second half starts it takes it to another level. beyond our imagination and a amazing climax leaves you thrilled. film keeps you on the edge of seat throughout the 2 and half hour. astonishing sets,superb background score,tight script,marvelous performance and NEERAJ PANDEY. lets say the later NAME is enough to make you expect the unexpected. lets have a look to the performances : Manoj Bajpayee is amazing. one more time he gave his BEST and i don't think its necessary to say he is one of the most talented actor bollywood ever have. Anupam kher is also awesome with all his body language and dialogue delivery stuff. BUT this man AKSHAY was the show stealer. He did something out of the box and did it so brilliantly that you will remember him as his character name AJJU more than akshay. A film not to miss this weekend. All the abusive words got silenced and its a clean family entertainer with all the element to entertain and thrill you. missing such a cinematic experience will be a crime for a movie buff and bollywood lover. Rating : ALL THE STAR IN SKY",positive
Kai Po Che,"Kai Po Che, thus gives Bollywood a new wave of actors. Sushanth is a charmer. Amit Sadh is elegant and genuine. Yadav is creepy but portrays his role fantastically. The supporting cast is bold with Manav Kaul getting my uninterrupted attention. The music goes haywire sometimes, but the direction compensates it. Cinematography, I perceive has been a copy of Dil Chahta Hai while screenplay is non-linear & appreciable. The climax is different from the book & adds up little emotion to the film. Even if you haven't read the book, this one will give you a total feel of it.""I took the pains of making 3 Rock Ons!! for this,"" Anhishek Kapoor was himself quoted saying. And I second that. The glory of this adaptation is its screenplay, run time (135 minutes) & the audacity of film-making as a whole.Yes, there are some ennui-inducing sequences specially the romance thing which might... MIGHT annoy at times, but that is passable. Not much of dilly-dallying or item songs or stereotype ridden script or dialogs, this one. Indeed, KPC is a victory in itself! Yes, Gujarati people say it after achieving victory over kite flying, but after watching this, I too can say pretty much the same phrase with oomph. Except that the political hue was necessary, but the gore & violence made it look cranky. 7/10 for compressing such a magnificent book into a short film.BOTTOM LINE: Kai Po Che! is a pretty good film; a must watch this weekend (compared to Zilla Ghaziabad), but talking it with the likes of Dil Chahta Hai or Rock On!! would be mild disgrace to the latter because KPC doesn't talk more about friendship than it talks about its destruction. KPC will make you think, but it is not a GREAT* film as it tries very hard to achieve but still gets a cold spot.WATCH OUT FOR: Sushanth Singh Rajput, Manav Kaul, Amit Sadh & some tit- bits.*refers to actual meaning in the dictionary with in celluloid context.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESLanguage: Very Mild | Sex: No | Nudity: Very Mild | Smoking & Alcohol: Mild | Violence: Very Critical | Gore: Mediocre | Mouth-Kiss & Foreplay: Mild | Traumatizing Quotient: Strong",negative
Kai Po Che,"Earlier to, many movies tried to capture the incidents of Gujarat but this piece of work stands out from all of them. Beautifully and sensibly linking all of them with great success.

Great casting by the group.Great direction work.Music very different with studded Gujarati words and appeals all us north Indians. And purely one way a family movie which touches a bit from every person's life in the country and binds everyone with the highly accepted religion of cricket. Cons: should have been extended 1 hour more.",positive
Raanjhanaa,"Dhanush who had earlier wooed the South Indian audience with his acting skills, chose a script tailor made for him to launch himself into Bollywood. The movie, doesn't disappoint those who enjoyed the stories where love stands above everything else in life. To top it all, when you have ARR weaving his magic with some sublime music, the beauty of Banaras just comes alive in front of your eyes. The three main characters, all have their own shades of grey and more often than not they stem from Love. Sonam for once does justice to her role, she grew into her role as the movie progressed and gave a telling performance that she could reflect back with pride. Abhay was as flawless as ever, just easing through his role with nonchalant ease. It would only be fair if i end where I started - Dhanush simply stole the show with his intense portrayal of a person driven by love, a person who does the most stupid, brave and incomprehensible of things in the name of love. My Verdict: Expect a love story with a traditional characterization supported by some brilliant music and clean performances by the lead cast - you won't be disappointed.",negative
Raanjhanaa,"Lovely movie, it had a twist and a blend of action, drama, romance, a little bit fiction too. The movie is worth a watch. it displays the actuality of the people, their nature and all i loved the romantic part of the movie as well. it was fun, interesting and very very entertaining too. I seriously recommend it to be watched. it has a little bit abuses which aren't suitable for a child's attention. if you are looking for a movie to watch for fun, to cry, to feel love, experience pain,i am pretty astonished about ""Dhanush"" as this was his first movie in the Bollywood and he made his mark pretty high. People it must be watched at least once, and i am very sure about going to the cinemas to see it again Enjoy, It is not something either that will get you bored during the movie. The movie has brilliant direction, acting. For me its a 11/10",positive
Airlift,"One thing I've found prevalent among Indian cinemas are the ratings.Some of them are absurd to a point where you doubt the authenticity of IMDb as a source for checking the quality of any movie.This movie is one of the good ones but still it does not deserve its rating at all.There is no way it comes close to it.For example consider the latest release like Deadpool or Batman vs Superman.Both are equally excellent in terms of story,cinematography and both possess a line of star studded casts.Yet both of them do not have a rating they deserve because of the fair and right ratings from experts and viewers not from a particular or single place but from all over the world.Looking at this rating,I seriously doubt the entire Indian cinema ratings and would rather skip than waste my time and energy to go through any of the high rated movies and would skip the ones that do not even reach 5.This is my personal opinion but all I'm saying is the fans are not doing anyone any favors by giving outrageous ratings.",negative
Airlift,"After Bajrangi Bhaijaan, this one is the next heart stealer! In an industry where good films are not as often coming, movies like these are hugely treasured. Airlift is a real story where humanity is celebrated, and a movie on humanity needs to strike the right chord to enter the audience's hearts. And this one very memorably goes! Akshay Kumar gives his heart and soul to the role and is a huge reason why the movie achieves its heights. The screenplay and direction are top notch, and the music is very hum worthy. And best thing, it felt like it ended early as audiences were wanting more. Seriously Indian cinema standards will take a rise more with this movie. Highly recommended watch!",positive
Cinayet Süsü,Storytelling is really bad and its like the most booring movie ive ever seen dont watch it it is not worth you time.,negative
Cinayet Süsü,I have seen like really serious comments for this really funny movie. Guys please calm down and chill. It's as you can see just a comedy. Do comedies always follow the real life and perfect mentality? I don't think so. I love it especially Cengiz Bozkurt is -in a word l-amazing. I cried when I was laughing. Soundtrack also amazing! Go on Ali Atay and every single person who support or contribute this. I might be a little bit emotional because of this negative comments but only reason is I really like this movie and couldn't believe all those comments,positive
The Boy and the Beast,"Based on his wonderful films Wolf Children, The Girl Who Stepped Through Time, and Summer Wars, I've been thinking of Mamoru Hosoda as the heir apparent to Hayao Miyazaki, not because they're that stylistically similar but because both make beautiful, very human movies that give me joy. But The Boy and the Beast isn't anywhere near the level of his previous films.In premise alone, this film is far less interesting, falling into the clichéd reluctant-master-rebellious-student rut. Teacher teaches student, student teaches teacher, helpful sidekicks comment on the action, and it's all leading to the big fight.None of which is particularly bad, and the movie is perfectly enjoyable, but towards the end things go off the rails as a new storyline is awkwardly tossed in and a lot of new information is offered far too late in the game. It feels like two or three bits of movies were poorly welded together.Whether the reviews on IMDb are positive or negative, reviewers declare this beautifully animated, but while the animation is fine, there was little in it that was exceptional.Since Hosada's One Piece debut, every movie he has made was more wonderful than the one that preceded it. I can only hope that this is a stumble, not a fall, and that his next movie will be a return to his earlier brilliance.",negative
The Boy and the Beast,"Now with this movie finally getting an official release of course it has to open the same weekend as Zootopia (haven't seen but will review soon) which is killing the box office, while the Boy and the Beast had a total of 4 people in the theatre, two of which were me and my friend, and although I'm sure Zootopia is great, there needs to be love for this movie too! Japan is currently kicking anyones but in the animation department, and this film is nothing short of that, it looks beautiful almost every scene. The story it self is a simple one but the characters were so intriguing that it helped the story so much, basically a quick sum of the plot is there is a beast world and a human wanders into it to train with one of the beast, and as I mentioned I'm sure you are thinking that this is such an unoriginal plot, which in a way it is nothing new, but again you care about the characters so much that it throughly enhances the story, and the story actually has a great side plot. If you need something to watch this weekend I'm sure Zootopia is great for the family, but The Boy in The Beast is great for anyone, as it isn't too ""anime"" for the average person. Mamoru Hosoda really has quite a talent and with Miyazaki retiring I think he is going to cement himself as the best in animated films for years to come.So to sum things up definitely see the Boy and the Beast, it is a fantastic time age range: 10+ score: 10/10 would recommend to go watch",positive
Hichki,"Main female lead is born with a condition which forces her to hiccup or stammer or something between both. There is not any strong reason for her desperate desire to be a teacher while she is easily offered job in a bank. Her hiccups are plain annoying and clearly not fit for any profession where good speaking would be must. An upper class English medium school is not ready to accept slum kids, who are pushed over to them by Government, due to right to education act to study. Characterization of these kids are so cheesy, like they have shown in there very first scene, as drinking country liquor, smoking, gambling with playing card in school, because they belong to slum!? Then why they are not stopping to go to school is not clear, even how did they reach ninth standard when they were not a bit interested in study!? Why did school administration not rusticate them in beginning even being aware of their budding criminal like activities in school, when they could have do so as they decide to do in pre climax!? It seems that only a single teacher is taking class of all subjects of ninth standard!? If you are unable to understand science and math of ninth standard then you won't get the point of few scenes. Performance wise Rani Mukherjee is sincere, looks beautiful but fails to impress except in the scene where she breaks down. Harsh Mayer, who played student Atish, performed like a seasoned actor. Shivkumar Subramanium as Pricipal is very good. Neeraj Kabi as antagonist teacher is first rate. Title track music is so soothing and melodious.",negative
Hichki,"Hichki - 10/10 . Must Watch.I went to the movie theater after going through multiple mixed reviews from the so-called movie critics. 
For those who have seen the trailer, this will be nothing new
Plot: The main protagonist Naina Mathur has Tourette's syndrome who desperately wants to be a teacher. Even after multiple rejections, her decision to take up teaching as a profession remains firm. Finally, she gets offered, a job @ St.Nautkers but her class of 14 is full of rebels. We get glimpses of her childhood, as to how irritating it must have been to have been misunderstood and made fun of. She even shares an estranged relationship with her father. So basically, how she deals with all these hichkis is the story all about.Its a very simple plot of underdog meets underdogs and how they excel, but to make such a predictable plot interesting and watchable is where lies the craft of cinema. The direction, screenplay, cinematography, casting all in all was top notch. From the word go the movie started connecting. Everything was expressed in a subtle way. Nothing was over the top. There were many tear-jerking moments in the movie. There was never a dull moment. Every single character was bang on.Coming to performance, the 14 slum students(especially Aatish) were so good at their respective roles. Niraj Kabi as the other teacher was top notch, his transition in body language and dialogue delivery towards the end spoke leaps and bounds about how seasoned an actor he was. Sachin and Supriya as Naina's parents were apt. For obvious reasons, the belongs to Rani Mukerji. Rani as Naina Mathur is brilliant. She has given an outstanding performance which will guide many upcoming actors.No words to express my thoughts about how good an actor she is.As a die-hard Rani fan, I was nervous. I was just happy seeing her after 4 long years on the silver screen. Had no big expectation from the movie. But oh boy was I taken aback. The movie was something else. It was class apart.It was just awesome. It had the right pinch of ingredients.The main thing about the movie is that there is nothing forced, The music is not loud to drive you emotionally. You are at your own free will. It doesn't try to influence you. 
The teacher-student relationship has been portrayed so well. A student will be fortunate to have a Naina Mathur teach them. Everything was intact. You will start reminiscing. It for sure will be a nostalgic experience for many. For the 1st time in my life, I clapped once the movie got over. That was the impact it had on me.One piece of advice to all the people out here, please comment after watching a movie. Don't mislead people with your prejudice. This movie deserves to be a hit. Only then more of such will be made. All we get to see is stupid masala flicks crossing 100 crores with ease. But movies like Hichki in spite of having a very strong content end up doing an average business, one main reason, without doubt, it has a female protagonist. Come on guys times are changing. Appreciate movie's content. Every teacher/student/parent should watch the movie. Hoping for the movie to do good business. All the best to the team of Hichki.",positive
The Dark Valley,"Pleasantly surprised to find an authentic Western rivaling Dances with Wolves and Eastwood in quality and ambiance. And, shockingly, it's a German production filmed in the Italian/Austrian Alps. The character presentations, props, sets, landscape, costuming, background sound effects and music were created, or reworked from existing structures, such that I could feel those rain drenched muddy roads on my feet as I watched. Bonus - action, suspense, storyline twists and emotional intensity. Landscape/scenery looked very much like the Rockies to me and I've traveled the Rockies from Canada nearly to Mexico. My only negative is, like many movies, the director did not have enough real world dirt and tatteredness in the costuming and props.",negative
The Dark Valley,"There isn't much to say about this movie. I was pretty thrilled to hear that Das Finstere Tal was chosen to be among the Oscar candidates. So I simply had to give it a shot, after all it's an Austrian movie. So what I've come to find is that, as you watch the film, it gets more and more awe-inspiring. Sam Riley's performance is simply impeccable. The cinematography stunningly created, the shots simply gorgeous and even the soundtrack is genuinely amazing. Andreas Prohaska has created something I haven't seen in a while. Bottom line, I'd highly recommend the movie to everyone interested in something refreshingly original, an alps-western (even if I never thought this genre would even exist).",positive

Extraterrestrial,"This teeters on the edge of being a comedic IKWYDLS slasher/horror movie (with aliens in it) as opposed to a full-fledged UFO shocker. It has that commercialized ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" vibe and (intentionally?) comes across as totally over-the-top and cliché. It kicks off in that overplayed fashion, with the auto-tuned emo rock band playing in the SUV, as the college students go on a weekend getaway to their rich parents' cottage. You begin to expect absolutely no character depth and no intelligent dialogue (which is the way the director wanted it I guess). It does unfold in a corny kind of way but it has elements of awesomeness in it. The timing of the jump scares is really good. The moments of alien contact are really cool-looking. Even though it has an almost comedic atmosphere, it still manages to be scary. This is a decent horror movie, with good jump scares....so check it out. If...you can get past the anal probe jokes and corny characters.",negative
Extraterrestrial,"I saw a lot of negative reviews for this movie, and I just don't get it. I found it far superior to the garbage that Hollywood typically churns out. On a minuscule budget, The Vicious Brothers truly have come through with a frightening and atmospheric sci-fi horror movie. Once the aliens start popping up, there is a true feeling of paranoia and desperation in that log cabin as everyone tries to survive the night. Excellent performances from all of the young leads and a truly daring ending make this a must see. I'll take this movie over Sinister, A Haunting in Connecticut, etc. any day. I want to see more from these directors.....",positive
Mood Indigo,"It's been a long time since I've been acquainted with Michel Gondry. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Science of Sleep are two of my all-time favourite films. Be Kind Rewind was an unfortunate misfire but I already warmly welcome his style. However, I've never seen him quite so unrestrained like this. Mood Indigo is a truly fantasy world. No dream, no drugs, and nothing is how you'd expect. Not even dancing, not even a handshake. To say the world of Mood Indigo is surreal and absurd is an understatement and no words can quite grasp the chaos on screen. It's like an R-rated Dr. Seuss. Like Gilliam's Brazil. But, it's an absolute delight. Things may not make sense at any point, but it's not about symbolism, it's about expressionism. The characters are deeply human, and that's what counts. All these inventions, twists, obscurities all about emotion. And Mood Indigo constantly had me bellying with laughter or sinking an anchor in my stomach when tragedy strikes even when I wasn't sure what was happening.That's the spirit of filmmaking really, to feel how the characters are feeling, and this film achieves it admirably. But at times it is so dense that its hard to keep up. The special effects and production design are wonderful, but the way it's shot in HD does sometimes nullify its effects and brings us back to reality in a way it doesn't want (I would've preferred Gondry to not have his cameo). Sometimes the cast can't even keep up with it. I really wasn't sure about the cast at first. They're familiar faces, but they didn't seem to suit the tone, plus they felt too old. However, with the film's dark twist in the second half, so dark the film turns black and white, it did become apparent that these cast members fit this melancholic side of the world. I wish it wasn't so bloated in characters and was more restrained like The Science of Sleep. The great soundtrack definitely adds to its rich atmosphere too. I do hope this film will stick with me like his two best films. It may be manic, but it's thoroughly charming. Not Gondry's best but his best in a long while.8/10",negative
Mood Indigo,"When I decided to go see that movie, I was really scared. Scared that, somehow, this movie might be bad, whereas the book of Boris Vian is one of my favorite. But when I got out, I was really amazed. I felt almost depressed, exactly the same way when I finished reading the book. For the whole night long, I couldn't keep my mind of the movie, and I was barely able to sleep. Gondry actually made me open my eyes about some things, that I couldn't imagine or figure out. But when I think about it, it just make sense. Like the fact that Alise is black woman. I don't know why, I've always imagined her as a white and blonde woman. But it's only natural that she is in fact black.I can understand the fact that some people would not like the movie, being very weird, and being in it's own universe. But I really think this movie deserves a way better grade. Maybe one of the greatest adaptations that I have seen, yet. I gladly recommend to see this movie.",positive
Bilal: A New Breed of Hero,"So you get 3 instead! Thank you Barajoun Entertainment for making up for the film's dryness on screen by introducing one of the most entertaining IMDb pages in a long time, Please don't stop!I do not wish to repeat what others have said about your magnificent PR campaign, not only in IMDb but also in your social network websites, but it does show sad desperation instead of letting the movie speak for itself and leave the judgement to the audience.I will bet my Kentucky horses that it's the same fellow with the same broken English with the same justifications here. At least change the method so it won't be that noticeable. Introduce unique plot twists and expressions.You think people don't know how easy it is to buy votes and reviews in international channels, good for you though, thankfully there were a few genuine and non bought reviews that unfortunately wiped the floor with the film. Just like the US presidential Campaign of 2016, a few dollars can go a long way in the media of a capitalistic world. Even they lost when it came to the people it seems.No wonder the story and the film turned up the way it did when you don't even have half of the imagination to write a few diverse reviews in these pages.",negative
Bilal: A New Breed of Hero,"Bilal is the biggest first ever animated movie created in middle east till date.Spectacular visuals and strong characterization are some of the key factors of this movie. its production of established animation studio in UAE.The efforts and top notch work standard can be easily seen on the screen.Every character in film is crafted very well. Well voice overs for each character putting more life in them. its like introduction of the part of history.The movie is a fascinating glimpse into an important period in the history of the region, and the attention to detail paid to the costumes and backgrounds gives an authentic impression of the historical.

Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior,"When i watched this movie i found it entire commercial crap. Tanhaji was brave and loyal,and so was udhaybhan. Udhaybhan was not a cruel person and he was appointed by jaisingh, no relation between aurangzeb and udhaybhan. The people who watch this kind of historical crap they believe it and true history got lost. Nobody believes true history of tanhaji after this commercial crap. And shivaji maharaj never tried to keep secret of kondana from tanhaji he directly said that he could not come to raiba's marriage because he wants to win kondana fort. Nothing they showed about suryaji brother of tanhaji. After tanhaji dies suryaji leads the battle. Shivaji maharaj did not came in the battle when tanhaji was dying. After knowing that tanhaji was dead shivaji maharaj greived and named kondana as sinhagad and said that ""the fort is captured but lion is dead"". This movie don't deserve 8.4 rating.",negative

Fan,"After a long time, finally a SRK movie that propelled me to take some time out and write up a post.To begin with, FAN, by no means is a perfect and flawless movie (more on that later), but what the movie has successfully achieved is to unearth the untapped ACTOR out from the catacombs of mediocrity that has thus hindered the transition of THE STAR to an ACTOR.Director Maneesh Sharma, who also claims to be a big SRK fan himself, surely knows that the general audience wants to see more than rhythmic extension of arms from the MAN who once gave extremely nuanced and balanced portrayals in Swades and CDI. And hereby comes the movie FAN which can be any actor's dream role. From an uncouth and lovable Gaurav Chandana to a shrewd, realistic Aryan Khanna, it was hard to imagine that the same actor did play both the characters and that too with so much attention to detail. There are quite a few scenes that leaves you in awe of the exemplary display of Acting and makes you wonder ""where was this SRK hiding for so long?"" Kudos to the Director for taking this bold step of making the movie without any songs, heroines or as a matter of fact any comic scenes as well. It is just one man show from beginning to end laced with some superlative performance.Now coming to the flip side, at least for me, are the 3 exceptionally well designed and seemingly never-ending chase sequences which somewhat dilutes the impact. But again I see others really praising those sequences (so it depends on the taste I assume). Another glaringly noticeable point is the contrastingly different approaches to handle the 1st and 2nd halves. In the first half, the makers tried to keep the narrative as much close to reality as possible but in the 2nd half, Maneesh Sharma played it to the gallery where logic takes a backseat, but the sequences concerned are certainly thrilling and creepy enough to keep you glued to your seats.Lastly the climax which might receive extreme opinions, but I personally loved the ending.To conclude, this is not one of the best performance of SRK, rather his career best performance. And the movie might not earn big bucks because of its dark, grim and creepy undertones but will surely earn the love of moviegoers.",negative
Fan,"FAN is Shah Rukh Khan's best performance till date. His Aryan Khanna is Excellent but his Gaurav Chandana is better. This is the SRK I grew up watching. He can't really top this one. Kudos to the VFX and the prosthetic team for the make up. Maneesh Sharma's direction was brilliant. The story is different. The dialogues are very very good. Habib Faisal has done a good job with the dialogues. The costumes are dope for Gaurav . The editing is crisp and the screenplay is Fantastic. The movie has no songs(That was a bummer) The cinematography was exceptional, great locations. Since, the movie is completely focused on Aryan and Gaurav, the supporting cast don't have much to do. It's good seeing a movies like this is being made. Something different. It won't be a great success at the Box Office as it's a dark movie. The flaw what I found was the Special Effects in the first Chase Sequence- You'll notice it. Well one of the best movies SRK has ever acted in. 9ish/10",positive
Pawn Shop Chronicles,"Hadn't heard anything about this movie, or even known of its existence, until about an hour before I watched it tonight, lol. First off, for all you Norman Reedus fans: Even though he gets near top billing, You never see his face, and his screen time is like 2 minutes, so calm down for thinking you found a new Reedus film to be excited about, lol. (Don't you hate it when they do that :o/) This film's a good example of that scenario where the concept or premise of the film, its preview, and poster, make the film look really good, only to have the execution and/or the end of the film fall flat. High quality acting performances were given by the entire all star cast, Brandon Frasier especially, impressive as a lost, struggling, Elvis impersonator. There were some good, entertaining moments in the movie that gave me hope, but that's as far as it got. For every moment it seems like it was going to recover, it would fall again, including the ending, which was a let down, and, honestly, even for a movie of this genre, I felt the ending was in bad taste and crossed a line, as they tried to make humor of a man keeping women in captivity. VERY BAD timing, after what just went down in Ohio. You know how a movie can be so weird, but in a good way, or so weird in a bad way ? Well for me, this had both, but in the end, just left me feeling in a bad way. But, I say ""for me"", and rate this in the middle because, I'm sure there's going to be some of you sick pups out there that's going to think it was hilarious, while others will think it's just plain weird, in a bad way. 2.5 out of 5, or 5 out of 10 IMDb stars.",negative
Pawn Shop Chronicles,"Just discovered this movie and decided to watch as it is listed as a 'comedy'. And a very dark comedy it is! There are some really disturbingly funny scenes, but I found the balance of the film to be a sarcastically allegorical comment on life in America. Why the previous reviewers missed this is a surprise! Throughout the entire story director Wayne Kramer has offered to the viewer symbolic remarks on religion, politics, and economic life in the American laboring society.First we see the pawn shop - in America everything is a commodity that can be sold and bought - nothing has real value and value is always marginalized when the seller is in 'need'.Second Kramer offers the three rednecks who, on the surface are religious, in symbols only, and have no idea why 'they believe' because they are too consumed with destructive self indulgence. Then when Vernon is left for dead a 'savior' appears not to save him but to offer the chance for revenge. In America it's just believing that makes religion true, not understanding and living it.Third Richard discovers 'the ring' in the pawn shop and seeks answers as to how it got there. Kramer again shows us how property is valued in the social order. Material things along with humans are gifts for capitalist overlords. Shaw represents the ownership society. And when they offer favors to the 'working class' they are to be obedient and grateful, as seen with the caged women for Shaw's pleasure and the 'number one' caged girl who refuses to leave because she gets 30 minutes of television a week in 'the house'. Richard is the liberator and freedom fighter that American's always reject and destroy.Fourth Kramer gives us Ricky, the fourth rate Elvis impersonator, and here Kramer sums up the movie. Americans want to be 'a star' but few have that kind of talent outside of being a big fish in a small pond. And thats where Ricky finds himself. His image is compelling to the locals in that unnamed small southern town and they willing follow him around! Ricky wants a barber to even his sideburns and must choose between two identical barber shops. Kramer smartly symbolizes the American political system here as there is no real difference between the two leading parties (Democrats & Republicans). But the locals think there is a difference between the two barber shops and when Ricky picks one over the other mayhem erupts in the street. In America perception is what drives the choices. When the choice really doesn't exist! When Ricky gets to perform at the carnival he is so unprepared and untalented the locals reject him. Then when he accepts the offer made by the street preacher (Mephistopheles type character), Ricky's whole image changes when he starts singing 'Amazing Grace'. Suddenly the local towns folk see him as bright and talented because he has accepted their Christian values. Then the naked and filth covered cage women show up and wrap themselves in the American flag. The image of justice and freedom shine as long as Americans have patriotism and God. Shaw returns from the dead to claim the filth covered women and a new woman. They all follow him out. The locals are too star struck to notice what's happening right before them. Kramer shows how Americans cannot escape the capitalist system (Shaw) because society will always give into religion, patriotism and those who control the money.The film closes with Harry (little man/big truck) entering the pawn shop to teach Alton a lesson but JJ quells him easily and then it's business as usual for Alton. Harry is the collective conscience of America and it's small and easy to overlook, but it's always there.Pawn Shop Chronicles is a triumph for Kramer - it's perfection start to finish!",positive
The 9th Life of Louis Drax,Nominated worst movie of the year?. I wonder what was watching these guys I really don't understand critic experts. Since Shakespeare in love won i quit of listen to them. This is a great movie. It starts as a comedy then turns to drama then to fiction and ends with mystery and investigation. So you have a good movie with lots of éléments. Maybe is not the best but it doesn't disappoint. Worth to see more than many others.,negative
The 9th Life of Louis Drax,"This movie draws you along, and doesn't leave you in your own head trying to figure out what happens next, till near the end. And even then, you are riveted. The ending had a small twist, that was well done, but seemed a little too preachy at the end. I guess some filmmakers and/or story writers feel the need to supply morals in a world that has no basis for them anymore. Nonetheless, the plot devices and its non-linear storytelling blend well together, and make for a big win in my book. The performances were all lights out fantastic from a cast of relative unknowns. This gives you hope for the future of cinema, and dramatic acting in general. Especially in this era of the super hero film. It also seamlessly blends science and medical technology with the paranormal, in a way I haven't seen since ""The sixth Sense"". More than any other film I have reviewed here (and there have been a few that I have felt unjustly rated) this film's overall low rating is grossly unfair. It blends all the tools of good storytelling and suspense, with great revelations at its climax and ending. Not to mention dialog that leads you where it wants you to go I highly recommend it.",positive

Karwaan,"What is a road movie if it has not chafe the topic of self-discovery? Karwaan is thankfully not devoid of the usual ingredients plus some more eccentricities developed by its formula characters. Which at the end does not help it stand out from all the other road movies we have seen before.Writer Bejoy Nambiar's cliched story is a straightforward setup of a drained and unenthusiastic software engineer Avinash (Dulquer Salmaan) trying to retrieve his late father's body from Coimbatore. Helping him in this 'endeavor', as per director Akarsh Khurana, is a mysterious and over-zealous mechanic friend Shaukat (Irrfan) who seems to be a walking book of jokes and contrived thoughts that look like they were also borrowed from the elastic Internet and a ridiculously similar recent Bollywood film, Tanuja Chandra's Qarib Qarib Singlle (2018). Together they follow Khurana and scenarist Adhir Bhat's storyboard to an eventful journey from Bangalore while meeting at least three new people that would change their lives. That Mithila Palkar plays (Tanya) one of these people not only adds to the annoyance in the experience but also completes Karwaan as a rehash of all road films.Whether it is Avinash who shows no remorse at his father's death or about the body mix-up or Tanya who is that spoiled brat with Himalayan proportions of angst inside her just because she had to deal with a death when she was eight, Karwaan has a reason for everything. It tries to justify its characters' actions using random story arcs that are emotional, but downright ridiculous. Death seems to be an easy subject for each and every character in Karwaan until it suddenly isn't. Forget about the transition, the characters fail to emphasize this development as we see the film take a turn at the eleventh minute just to show that ""different people grieve differently"". I am all in for eccentric road trips but there has to be honesty in the storytelling when you are trying to convey a message, even if it means trading with sassy humor. Karwaan lacks that honesty.The narrative gets a flat tire when it extends to a territory that would have reduced the running time by 30 minutes. But then how would they demystify Shuakat's story and add more to the sassy humor. There is a clear attempt at projecting this entire thing as a bittersweet story about life and death, yet the contrived nature plays spoilsport with it. The bending of the genre is appreciative, and I am more than happy with Hussain Dalal's funny dialogues and their timing, but none of that would help salvage the car heading towards an accident because of the flat tire that they fail to mend.Salmaan manages to portray his character like the decrepit van used in the film. It works and is perfect for the use, but it still has some problems. His Hindi dialogues are a bit rusty (but Avinash's a native of Bangalore, mind you) but his expressions and acting, in general, make up for it. His deep voice adds to his character, which is why I would say that his casting was one of the best decisions the makers made for the film. The same isn't true for Irrfan who is typecast and made to look like a fool in the name of comedy. His actions surely will tickle your bones and make you chuckle for about three seconds. You will soon realize that this comedy is the only saving grace of the movie, and the character who delivers it is annoying to the core. But Palkar wins that throne as her teenage character successfully captures the millennial vibe, using Snapchat and Instagram to chronicle the trip, testing if she's preggers just to add that ""you know what' to the story, and having no regard to her mum or anyone in her life to showcase the ""cool teenager of the 21st century"". She is incredible, but her character is again a piece of cliched cake that Khurana seems to be a master baker of. I'm only happier that she didn't pull off a Kiki challenge using the symbolic van. That would have given the writers one more joke for Shuakat to crack. Sad.The lead protagonist's anger towards his job and the IT sector, in general, is loud and clear in Khurana's screenplay, and I have all the reasons to believe that Khurana knows someone who or was himself laid off by an IT company. Not taking names, but this type of stereotyping is all over the place in his Karwaan. From Shaukat's vindictive dialogues about partition and the British Raj to two unsuspecting foreigners (who may not even be English), again his condescending ways against two hippies from Europe, and his overall decipherment of people in large highlights and shamelessly supports the dogma that the world has been trying to eradicate. I cannot support entertainment of that kind even if it means in a light heart. I wonder if the CBFC only cares about sex and Kashmir.Moreover, for the entire running time of the film, I even believed that Irrfan had just moved out from the sets of the Tanuja Chandra film and stepped into Khurana's without even changing his attire. Such is the similarity between the characters, whose life philosophy seems to be originating from the same source. The other two characters use each other as sources and thereby discover themselves. The soothing soundtrack is supportive of the nature of the film but they will be forgotten before you move out of the hall. But what WILL stay with you instead is the logistical issues in the film. As a pedant, I was wondering how these people were transporting a dead body inside an aluminium box for days and without even once mentioning anything about a stench. Of course, Tanya once points out the decomposition factor, but a little more info would not have made me accuse Khurana of letting easy, small holes into his plot.Karwaan plays out like a fairytale of sorts where the forgiving characters go about on a journey that does not disclose any logistical parameters neither sheds light into what matters. It dances on the periphery and strives to add comedy to everything, even death, which is counter-productive to what it sets out to be.

Detective Byomkesh Bakshy!,"Is the movie watchable? Perhaps to a degree, until the climax.I give it 2 stars, 1 for art direction and another for the actors.With the exception of Swastika, acting is generally good. Even supporting actors do their part pretty well. Talking about supporting actors, there is a certain Japanese gentleman who looks and acts his part very well. But here's what goes wrong. His character, Dr. Watanabe, a practicing Japanese dentist, language teacher and samurai swordsman all rolled into one (not to mention being a Japanese secret agent) has one great flaw. That is he shouldn't have been there at all. His presence in Calcutta as a free man would be next to impossible in Calcutta in 1943, a time when the Allies where already in war with Japan. As soon as war was declared, he would have been arrested and sent to one of the many internment camps that detained enemy nationals like Germans or Italians. Remember 7 years in Tibet? Brad Pitt, a German national finds himself in an internment camp in British India from where he escapes to Tibet. The plot might have been saved if he was disguised as a Chinese or Korean doctor, or if he laid low in some other way. But what can we say, it's a creative reinterpretation and Bollywood hype nowadays use words like ""creativity"" in combination with ""well - researched"" to the an increasingly discerning audience hungry for new, read better quality cinema.1943 was also the year of the Bengal Famine. Various causes including food stocks being used up to feed soldiers resulted in a Holocaust. Thousands from the country side flocked to the city to beg for food and people died by hundreds on the streets from malnourishment and disease. Yet there was no evidence of any of it neither in the outdoor street scenes nor in the screenplay. Such a major event going all around and there's not a single mention of it? It's like a typhoon blowing around you and all you can talk about is what curtains will suit the window, or more interesting, who stole the curtain. To top it in the streets, there are vendors selling loads of green produce and the fish vendor shouting out how fresh the fish is. One wonders how much research really went into it writing the script. Surely much less than the hard work of the CG team.The aim is to make an entertaining movie, isn't it? But the public also demands good entertainment which includes well written plot not full of holes and inaccuracies especially when the hype was all about being so accurate in terms of recreating the period. Art direction is not everything. You can make a pretty convincing picture of the past but if the story has obvious flaws, it's a disaster.For the less discerning who don't care about their intelligence being insulted, get your bag of popcorns and (re)watch the film till the very end. That is if you can digest the ending sequences where the slo-mo blood bath and hackneyed Chinese torture takes place. It's not even funny.",negative
Detective Byomkesh Bakshy!,"Everything is amazing in the movie, the set especially. It is very scripted and screen written. Director Dibaker Banarjee has proved that he is in class of pure elite film-makers like Raju Hirani,Anurag Kashyap,Neeraj Pandey etc. It is set in 1942 with a loose connection to World war II. In short, it is all brilliantly put. The antagonist of the movie is more powerful than the protagonist. this gives another spark to the movie. Every scene is interconnected with each other which makes this mystery tale perfect. There is not a single scene about the movie which you can say is unnecessarily put into it. The only thing which could have been better is that the actors could have performed better. Sushant did all he could but that was like his 3rd film so he is not to blame and all the other actors aren't famous. Just because few people who have zero knowledge of movie have given negative reviews about it doesn't mean that movie isn't good. Anyone who loves sherlock is going to love this movie too. Its not a movie to miss guys. And its sad the movies like kick, dhoom3 and chennai express do all the business only because of big names while good movies like DBB don't get the business they deserve. Its a pure delight for mystery lovers.",positive
The Congress,"I have to admit that the first 45 minutes of this movie were quite intriguing. Why Robin Wright would apparently play herself in what is not a real-life story (?) is somewhat bizarre in itself. The concept of her selling her virtual reality bio-scan to the movie studio was thought-provoking and you imagined (or hoped!) the movie developing into something even more interesting and insightful...After 45 minutes you enter into phase 2 of this movie as it enters cartoon(ish) territory. Trying to make sense of it all (in my mind) I've surmised that you're meant to imagine virtual reality movies denigrating into cartoons (to save the studio even more money?). I'm not sure if that was the intention of the director & writers, that's just me trying to make sense of it all.The cartoon(ish) remainder of the movie didn't do anything for me as it was all just a tad too fantastical on whatever level you're meant to interpret the later half of this movie.4 stars go solely to Robin Wright for promising so much more in the first 45 minutes...",negative
The Congress,"After reading so many complaints posted on the web about the lack of originality in modern movies, one would think there would be a lot of support and praise towards a film that tries to do something different and unique, but it seems that complex (or merely unconventional) narratives are loathed here on IMDb. But then again, this is the same website that gives extremely inflated ratings to a lot of generic superhero flicks. It is also the only website where a show like ""Mr. Pickles"" could be rated so high.Anyway, ""The Congress"" is a wonderful film. Of all the movies that combined live-action with animation through the history of cinema, this might be my favorite. Plot-wise, ""The Congress"" might be closer to movies like ""Inland Empire"" rather than ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"". And the balance between the live-action parts with the animation is simply excellent.Some people say that it would have been better if the ""Hallucination"" parts were done in live-action, but I disagree: The animation sequences (Which make a marvelous combination of psychedelia with an art style reminiscent of the work of Max Fleischer) not only gives the story a proper dream-like feel to the story (Opposed to a dry and forgettable portrayal of dreams as it was seen in movies like ""Inception"") but also serve as a subtle commentary about modern-day obsession with escapism: It's something admirably subtle the way the thin line between fantasy and reality fades away as the plot of the film progresses, until the bitter reality is finally showed in a rather heartbreaking manner. Like at the end of ""Waltz with Bashir"", when the animation changes into live-action, we as viewers are forced to confront a harsh reality that cannot be ignored, and that reality is that living with our backs turned to the problems of today only will have dire consequences in the future, and we will have to deal with those consequences in one way or another. I guess that a message like that could be hard to swallow for many viewers, but I personally think that in this day and age, a message like that it's more necessary than ever.I hope ""The Congress"" gets eventually vindicated by history. Maybe in the future, people will be able to appreciate more its daring qualities. For now at least, the future of cinema seems bleak, with all the same generic stuff making billions at the box office while the actually challenging movies are perpetually ignored. A shame, really.",positive
Krrish 3,"Literally, each and every character, most of the action scenes, and dialogs in the film are inspired, or say blatantly copied from the Hollywood superhero films. X Men, Batman, Superman.. You name a comic hero, you got him in this film. Even the background score is lifted from Inception and The Dark Knight. And the worst part is that this plagiarism didn't pay off in the end. The screenplay was very poor. Action sequences looked too much fabricated, super slow, and lacked depth. It's a congery of B-grade visual effects, melodrama, and toothless humor.Final word: If you're are an eleven year old with no Hollywood experience, it's a treat for you. Or else, don't bother watching it.",negative
Krrish 3,"Just watched the movie. I think this movie is the first step of bollywood in making superhero movies. Hrithik roshan was fabulous in three different roles. He was childish as rohit,sweet&cute as krishna and menacing as krrish. I was moved when rohit died. Because rohit mehra was one of my favorite character which was portrayed by hrithik. Finally, it is good family entertainer. But it lacks somewhere to attract the youth. Kangana Ranaut was superb as Kaya. Vivek oberio was also good as Kaal. It could have been a better movie. Another drawback is that it has inspired by x-men,superman. Which questions the originality of the characters in the movie.",positive

Akshay Kumar do not need to romance hot girls, do not need to dance and sing, do not need to do melodrama to deliver a hit movie, he had shown us this back in Special 26, he has done the same here in Baby. The cast is a perfect one and there are no flaws.MOVIE: It has everything a good espionage thriller need to have- 1. Good cop bad cop routine 2. Cute chick beating the pulp out of the bad guy 3. Super cool combat scenes 4. No unnecessary sentiments and drama 5. Some brilliant dialogues 6. few laugh out loud scenes 7.

Yet, this movie is a rare feat. Bollywood rarely delivers movies like this. Its a must watch if you like sensible movies.

Baby,"Though I don't categorize movies on the basis of their region or country, I had mentioned this title regarding India being proud of this movie. This is because I have heard people yelling in social media and in public about the low standards of Indian movies specially thrillers which either lack thrill or are copied from Hollywood. I agree to them o most occasions but this one. And I would strongly recommend people who complain about the lack of good movies in Bollywood to go and watch it. Or else stop complaining these craps.Coming on to the movie, it describes the biggest agenda world is facing right now, i.e, Terrorism, in best way it could. The story comprises of many small incidents which are bound together so slickly that we feel the smooth flow of script. We are lost in the hustle going on in front of us and are keen to know what is coming next. First half makes the plot for the movie and the second half unleashes the execution. Each and every scenes complements its predecessor and we are biting our nails without even noticing it. Last hour is full of thrilling actions and grueling proceedings.Talking about the acting , I must say Akshay Kumar has delivered a role of his life very convincingly. He lives his character and puts that extra amount of thrill via his superb action. Danny plays his role quite brilliantly. Anupam, Tapsee, Kay Kay and other supporting casts act life to their characters and make this movie a combo of power packed performances.Director Neeraj Pandey has already made a Wednesday and Sp 26 in past and thats why there was a very little scope for improvement for him. But I would be lying if i don't say that this is a notch higher that his earlier masterpieces. Editing is quite crisp. Screenplay is the soul of this movie while BM is equally engaging. Cinematography is grand and deserve applause. Dialogues are apt and support the movie a lot. Music is average and rightly so. Choreography is nil while action is breathtaking.It has a few flaws here and there in a few scenes but those are hardly noticed due to the fast paced drama and screenplay.Overall, a standing ovation for Neeraj and Akshay to give us Indians a movie to feel proud of. It can easily go into books as one of the best Hindi movies.A movie of Hollywood standard and execution. And who knows Akshay might get a shot at his dream of wining a National Award. I won't be surprised if he gets one along with Neeraj Pandey. It also has a potential to be India's official Oscar entry next year.I have rated this movie comparing it to other Indian movies...otherwise I would universally give it a 9 or 9.5.",positive
Sultan,I do not see movies of Salman Khan and other khans (... except Irfan Khan) but was forced to see this movie with family. I would say Salman still struggles to perform and act after so many years. Story and plot was awful too. Total waste of money. However the main actress and other actors acting was superb and will help relieve the pain you are getting while watching this movie. I have kept myself far from khan's movies in general for so many years (Irfan khan is an exception) and I think its the right decision. Public watch these movies for time pass. There are other really good Indian movies being produced every day. And I would prefer to watch those in my precious time.,negative
Sultan,"I found myself really enjoying SULTAN. Ali knows how to push all the right buttons to keep the audience engaged. Ali's writing and directing are flawless. This is without a doubt Ali's best ever movie. Nushki is an acting diva and she is making her way to be the next great actress since Aishwarya Rai. I love love love Nushki, I truly adore her and always will. She's my love ;) xxx I must confess that I could watch Nushki in almost anything, but here she really delivers a performance that may be her best yet . . . and I've seen almost all of her work. Nushki elevates herself to a league of her own. She is a beautiful girl who is talented enough when playing ""regular"" characters, such as the journalist in ""PK"". But as a high profile corporate executive in ""NH10"" and in this film as a musclebound wrestler, she takes it to a level most female actors couldn't. You can tell how hard she worked to make this role believable because when she wrestles you forget it is Anushka Sharma in the ring. SK is always a pleasure to watch. Here his character's sizzling chemistry with Nushki is completely adorable and that moments of sweetness will surely MELT your heart. SK gives an incredible performance that will undoubtedly propel his career. Overall it is one motion picture that should never be missed nor put aside when selecting movies to be seen on a weekend. SULTAN is a sure winner for all.",positive

The Bag Man,"Preamble; I love movies of all genres from The Princess Bride to Total Recall with side-trips through the classics and British Comedies. That being said, this is perhaps the worst movie I've seen to which actors of this caliber have been attached. This is Grovic's first directorial attempt, and he has yet to develop a sense of tone, story-telling, etc... This movie is a mish-mash of other stories pasted together with no commitment to it being a comedy, gritty suspense story, visceral murder and mayhem fest or spoof. It's a mystery, to me, why these very talented actors made this movie. Are they friends or relatives of the director? Did he have a colossal budget to pay them? Was the script great and then thrown out during the process of making the movie? Beats me. I rented from a Red Box and I feel cheated at $1.20 Sorry for being so harsh about this film, but when proved actors whom I regularly pay theater prices to see work make a movie like this it's jarring to my artistic sensibility. Better luck next time.",negative
The Bag Man,"I usually watch movies based on their high IMDb scores, but movies like ""The Bag Man"" are why I sometimes dip down into the 5's and 6's. At first I was surprised to see so many reviewers call it ""boring"", ""bad"" and ""nonsensical"", but then I realized that this film just isn't for everybody, but for some--like me--it's riveting. Almost the entire movie takes place during one night at a roadside hotel, where our protagonist, a contract killer (Cusack), is meant to go with a package and wait for pickup. Only everything and everyone around him seem to be set against him. The characters he meets and adventures he has there are fascinating, quirky, and surreal. The best way I can describe it is as a mix between ""Identity"", ""Mulholland Dr."", and The Book of Genesis.I think this movie has gotten so many bad reviews because it doesn't fit the mold. It defies expectations, and some people won't like that. But if you're looking for something different, something that can surprise you, watch ""The Bag Man"". And try to vanquish your expectations.Special props to Crispin Glover for portraying the hilariously strange Ned. My favorite character!",positive
Cold in July,"When Richard Dane, (Michael C. Hall), shoots and kills a burglar his life, and that of his family, comes under threat from the dead man's father, (a grizzled and menacing-looking Sam Shepard), or so it would seem because Jim Mickle's excellent thriller ""Cold in July"" doesn't quite go in the direction we expect. It was adapted from a novel by Joe R. Lansdale but it could have come from Jim Thompson. It's also beautifully acted by Hall, Shepard and Don Johnson as a very unconventional private detective. It's certainly pulp fiction; it might have even been a B-Movie once upon a time, now given a high gloss finish. Very enjoyable, even if the violence may not be to everyone's taste.",negative
Cold in July,"Cold In July marks the fourth and most mature feature for director Jim Mickle, bringing electric performances and palpable suspense to an otherwise unoriginal premise. What sets this film apart from other films like it, such as Cape Fear, is the performances. Michael C. Hall gives one hell of a performance, letting the audience see a vastly different side of him. He generates a leading man quality in this film that, in my opinion, he has never done before. From the straight-out-of-the-80s mullet, to the tight Wrangler jeans, Hall fits the mold of an ordinary man from small town Texas in the 80s and does so very subtly without us ever thinking to ourselves that this man was Dexter. As much as I liked Hall's performance in this film, Sam Shepard and Don Johnson steal the film. Without giving too much away, Shepard and Johnson are two of the seediest dirty characters not in a Rob Zombie film. Each scene between Shepard and Hall generates a palpable tension that would be difficult to do with any other actors in their parts, respectfully. The story is interesting from jump street, its a familiar type of story but it has so many great twists and turns that you can't help but fall in love with it. The score here is also immersing. It rings back to Blood Simple, or John Carpenter's Halloween. It really throws us right into 1989 and does so with such grace that it really needs some attention. Jim Mickle proves here that he is a director to be reckoned with. As a fan of his previous films, Stakeland and We Are What We Are, I was excited to see this film. However, walking out of Cold In July made me ecstatic to see what he does next. Overall, Cold In July is brutal, unrelenting backwoods mayhem with great performances and plot twists galore. It definitely lives up to the hype and I highly recommend it.",positive

Things to Come,"The new release ""Things to Come"" is without question one of the most uninteresting, unengaging, plodding and pointless torture tests of cinematic viewing I will EVER experience in my, or ANY OTHER, lifetime.  I get that this is a slice of midlife crisis examination of a woman whose world is catastrophically crashing down all around her.  And I have appreciated the great French actress Isabelle Huppert in other star vehicles (e.g., ""Home"" and ""The Piano Teacher"").  But as talented as she is, Huppert is hopelessly lost in this pretentious mess centered around philosophy, anarchy and shattered relationships that tries hard, way TOO much so, in fact, to be more important and profound than the film ever manages to realize.  And trust me, I kept waiting for any manner of compelling ""things to come"" to actually come to pass here.  And waiting.  And waiting.  And waiting.  And waiting.   And...",negative
Things to Come,"""Things to Come"" is centered around Nathalie, a philosophy teacher, and while the film does touch on philosophical elements, the focus is on Nathalie's personal life and her own fears and thoughts about her slowly disintegrating personal relationships. She has her husband Heinz, two children, a mother on the verge of death who constantly needs her attention, and a previous student that she now has a sort of mother-son relationship with. The film starts with Nathalie, Heinz, and their children visiting a grave of a French author, and then cuts to several years later when Nathalie is called by her dying mother because she is ""having a panic attack"", although it seems she's done this before and simply wants to force her daughter to give her company. Soon after she is confronted by young protesters on the way to work. They are angry about something having to do with their future retirement. From the start, this film shows that it is about a fear of the future: fear of death, fear of loneliness, fear of old age.Soon it is revealed that Heinz is having an affair, and he is told by his children that he must choose between her and his wife. He tells his wife that he chose the other woman. She desperately addressed the news with ""I thought you would love me forever"".From here, she begins to realize her aging is happening faster than she has realized as her personal relationships and desires begin to fade away slowly and subtly until she is left with nothing but a cat, until she finally accepts her aging and lets go of that as well. The character becomes conflicted, and Isabelle Huppert conveys this repressed regret and fear perfectly. She doesn't want to care about her husband's affair, and she wants to be satisfied with what she has accomplished, but her dreams of the future seem to be destroyed, as each of those she loves begins to let her down. She even tries to fill the whole left by her husband through another relationship, but she no longer has the will or desire. In a great shot, the screen fades to black as she opens the blinds, showing the reality of her loneliness. She begins to lose hope.Her mother's death marks the disappearance of the one person in her life who still needed her. Her mother's life was revealed to be full of suffering and lost love, but Nathalie was the one thing in her life that she could be proud of, and now Nathalie has taken her place.As extreme as this sounds in my description, the film itself is very subtle, and relies heavily on Huppert's performance, to great effect.While ""Things to Come"" is a solemn, emotional film with themes that are upsetting and relatable for everyone, there is hope in the end. Through the newborn baby, there is hope, potential, and desire, and that is what is important. That is what we need to continue in life, even if the reality doesn't live up to the desire.",positive
Freeheld,"In a time when our nation is going through some the most progressive and long overdue changes in history, a film as timely as ""Freeheld"" would be welcomed with open arms and minds from critics and audiences. Unfortunately, what director Peter Sollett creates, in partnership with Academy Award nominated screenwriter Ron Nyswaner, is an uninspired, insipid, and downright cheap take on a same-sex couple fighting for death benefits.Starring recently Oscar-crowned Julianne Moore and Ellen Page, the two manage decent chemistry and maneuver through generic and Lifetime movie-like lines. The impressive Michael Shannon does his very best to elevate all the material, showing the if you're talented enough, no script can hold you back. On the hand, the rest of the cast, particularly Steve Carell, is so over-the-top, and poorly guided, that everything that could have made ""Freeheld"" a spectacular and moving drama, is quickly transformed into a distorted and tragic version of the Oscar-winning short that the film is based on. The most novice filmmakers could have created something more gratifying.""Freeheld"" tells the story of New Jersey police lieutenant, Laurel Hester (Moore), and her registered domestic partner, Stacie Andree (Page). When Laurel is diagnosed with terminal cancer, both battle to secure Hester's pension benefits.After just winning her long overdue Academy Award for last year's ""Still Alice,"" the excitement and anticipation for Julianne Moore's next role was at an all-time high. Moore, as we come to expect, commits firmly to the role of a dying woman. Reminiscent of performances like Hilary Swank in ""Million Dollar Baby,"" Moore dives into her psyche, offering her soul to a woman who lived her life with secrets, and became alive in her later years. While Nyswaner's script offers little insight into Laurel and Stacie's love, outside of montages and cancer treatments, Moore finds her way through the pitfalls to come out on the other side intact. Page, who was a strong voice in getting the picture made, is relegated to crying and awkward ticks. Several instances, we are led to believe that ""this scene"" will be ""her scene"" where she gets the chance to let loose and show us what she's all about. Once again, Sollett's plain and boring direction quickly cut her every scene short, and offer no room to explore her character's surroundings and feelings. It's a terrible waste of talent.Michael Shannon delivers a competent and layered performance as Dane, Laurel's cop partner. He finds the humanity and conflict in Dane's misunderstanding about Laurel's lifestyle and later in the fight for equality. He's the film's key positive note. Carell's over-the-top yelling and mannerisms is among the worst acting examples seen in 2015. It's as if Sollett decided to let ""Michael Scott"" from ""The Office"" run amok on the set because that's all that Carell manages to evoke. One year after a career-topping work in ""Foxcatcher,"" I'm embarrassed that this is his next venture for the world to behold.Even down to the cheesy score by Hans Zimmer, nothing about ""Freeheld"" sings. It lays dormant in a small courtroom, where anger and inspiration are supposed to fly but lies lifeless among the picket signs and Josh Charles' snarls. I was sincerely hoping for something better, actually something magnificent; too bad there's not enough vision to bring this powerful story to life.",negative
Freeheld,"If you've already seen Philadelphia (1993, with Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington), you'll watch Freeheld and have a feeling of déjà vu. Written by the same screenwriter, Ron Nyswaner, Freeheld has all the elements of its predecessor: (i) it's inspired by true events, (ii) the main character has a disease and enters into a legal battle while sick, and (iii) there is a lot of prejudice against homosexuals. Despite all the similarities, Philadelphia is superior, and I'll try to explain why.As Tom Hanks in Philadelphia, we see Julianne Moore transforms physically as the disease progresses. She always gives great performances, but I felt like I enjoyed it more during the first act, when she was struggling to keep her relationship a secret. Ellen Page is also great, especially when she's defied by her future boss who doesn't believe she can work repairing cars because she's a woman.Having said that, the best character, in my opinion, is Dane Wells (Michael Shannon), Laurel's partner in the police who struggles with himself when he finds out she's gay, but ends up helping her. Steve Carell is also in the cast and he was very applauded by the audience in the session I was in. He definitely gave the film a lighter and funnier tone, since it's clearly a tearjerker.Philadelphia had a different effect on me because the characters involved are more complex: the audience knows why Tom Hanks' character was fired, but the discussion is deeper than ""because he's gay"". In Freeheld, on the other hand, we see the ""Freeholders"" discussing Laurel's request behind close doors and their decision is simple and fast, with no further questions (except for Josh Charles' character). So, even though we all knew the ending to both films before they actually end, Freeheld felt like an old formula to me. Full review: http://wp.me/p5Rk4c-em",positive

The Survivalist,Judging by the poster this looked like a great post apocalypse drama. Instead it was a pile of pretentious artsy fartsy crap that moved along at a snails pace and got nowhere. Bloke lives in a hut after some disaster or other and grows food using his own waste. Bit like the Martian but without a script. Some woman turns up with her daughter and offers sex for food and board. Daughter duly obliges and the three settle down to a life of monotony and some sex. Then some dreary dialogue later bloke kills woman to ease her pain as she was dying and then all hell breaks loose as the hut gets invaded and everyone dies I think. Then daughter who survived the slaughter goes somewhere and does something and then it ends. I may be a bit loose on what actually happened as I was half asleep due to boredom and missed a couple of scenes but basically it's another pile of too clever drivel from the art squad who will tell us we are not intelligent enough to understand it and call it a masterpiece. Seen too many like this and am bored with them but am sure there will be another one along soon to stun us with it's brilliance.,negative

May not be for everyone, but a must for anyone who loves film and is bored of the spate of fantasy and YA dystopian dramas that are all too prevalent. This movie can be seen as both a futuristic nightmare and as a cautionary tale about our wasting of our resources and the dangers that loom. Martin McCann provides the heart and soul of the film in the title role and he is certainly destined for stardom. All the performances are brave and gut wrenching. Given the darkness of the film and its graphic visuals I am not sure if this film can find a wide audience but it is guaranteed to become a festival favorite and cult success.",positive

Trash,"A brilliantly exciting film from start to finish. The three boys are a triumph, and the way the film handles them, and uses their emotional closeness, their friendship, is a credit to Director Stephen Daldry and his crew, as well as to the three boys themselves, recruited from the streets of Brazil. The story jumps from one level of excitement to the next in a series of clever set pieces that, at the same time as they increase the tension to almost unbearable levels, answer the questions raised by the mystery; what exactly is the significance of what the boys find, as they comb through the giant mountains of trash, trying to earn enough to eat from recycling plastic and tin? The chase scenes through the favelas are exhilarating. Literally, you find yourself talking out loud. The film is a celebration of Andy Mulligan's stunning novel of the same name.",positive
Louder Than Bombs,"Trier's English-languaged debut has been praised by many, but NOT by me. This is the essence of mediocrity: forgettable, not moving, not interesting, not dramatic. There is really no point to this. The cinematography is beautiful, the editing is quite inspired and interesting, but the script is awfully bland and the otherwise fantastic actors and actresses are wasted and utilized in a horrid way. Eisenberg is just plain old Eisenberg; Byrne can't save his character; and worst of all: Huppert is reduced to a boring character with no real depth or energy. It's all so incredibly lame. There are a few subplots in it, but it doesn't feel like it has a real plot or story that can drive the additions. Besides, the entire thing with the youngest son is that he likes to play Skyrim and he writes bad poetry that brings him success with a girl (realistic much??). This entire premise is horrible and made me sad for whoever wrote this uninspired crap: it's a big bowl of nothing. It's worse than nothing, it's boring, a void, a complete waste of time and Huppert. I hated it and almost couldn't finish it. Besides, a bunch of morals to the story did bother me: none of the characters are likable, but I feel like they were meant to be. The journey is not a journey, but a stagnant and static group of characters in a dull setup. It's not bad. It's just mediocre. Incredibly mediocre. Normally, the quite impressive productive forces behind a movie like this can make it count, but this one will be forgotten completely in five years - only remembered by the handful of people that could relate to one of the characters. I couldn't... Five out of ten. And maybe four on a bad day.",negative
Louder Than Bombs,"I did not experience the powerful emotions that I am sure this movie was meant to elicit. There are probably a few reasons for this. First of all, there was not enough history to the characters - what made them tick? What were they like before her death? What about her? Was the depression always there or did her travels bring it on? Secondly, with the exception of Byrne, the characters were not likable (perhaps if we had more history, we could like them more by understanding them more). The sons were just horrible - I get grief - I have been there. But you don't spit in your teacher's face because she is dating your Dad, who deserves some tiny bit of light in his dark life while trying to raise his troubled boys alone. You don't cheat on your wife who just gave birth - you just don't - even if she is a nag. Lastly, you don't kill yourself when you have a family who loves you - it is the ultimate selfish act under these circumstances - more selfish than cheating on your hubby (oh, you did that, too). Byrne was the only one who walked away with my sympathies.",positive
Mirror Game,"unique concept, good story & script, superb directing and great camera work make this movie one of the best creation Bangladeshi movie industry. especially Chanchal was great in the main character, maybe this is his best acting. Others did great too. I don't know if anyone can show us the dirty Dhaka as such a beautiful city. Really camera work was great. As a normal movie audience, the whole film seems to be very interesting and exciting to me. No over-acting, no plot hole, no extra bright make up and no boring scene- all make this movie very interesting for the audiences. And it's worth watching. The whole Aynabaji team deserve to be appreciated.",negative
Mirror Game,"This is my first IMDb review, please excuse my English grammar...The soundtracks of the movie was the foremost reason for which I went watching it, tracks from Arnob, Shaan and Habib were laid throughout the film absolutely magnificently.From the beginning till the end, the film stretched out unfolding plot so much unpredictable that the effect of Aynabaji (magic of mimicry) surely effected major part of the audiences in the theater hands down.Building up of suspense has occurred from the get go, acting performance of the hero character was not only spellbinding but also very interesting.If you're predicting this movie to be a typical 'art film' where one can tell how the story will cut curves towards the end, then you would be wrong my dear friends; as auxiliary characters seen in the movie may become center of attention from time to time, which unfolds thrilling new openings for the storytelling experience.For filming, absolutely fantastic locations were selected, very well composed production values were used cleverly for shooting with 6K camera, true cultural essence of old Dhaka was present in the movie, stages prepared for shooting various shots for the movie were also outstanding, lovely concept of 'Hawa Ghar'!As always Amitabh Reza told us the story meticulously, composition of each characters were extremely well thought, not a single character I found in the film was least important, which made the entire crowd grabbed by their collars to enjoy the movie.Chanchal Chowdhury has pulled off few great tricks of diving deep into character detailing, it was a treat to watch the 'training scenes'. Masuma Rahman Nabila acted superbly well in the film, her simplicity of acting the role was reflected positively towards audiences. Dress design was also done well in the movie, Easter eggs ;)Many would find Partho Barua better one to come out acting for the crucial part of the story, and I would agree with them, persistent characteristic of the role he played in the movie was undoubtedly extraordinarily acted by the singer come actor.General pace of the movie seemed slow however, as the full length of the movie is way more than 90 minutes, building up sheer suspense each long scenes have played out nicely to stand out from the crowd.Syed Gaosul Alam Shaon has enabled this movie to have a sequel, which is another great reason you should definitely watch this great movie. Dialogue and screenplay was above excellent and it was a delight to watch the Barisal local dialect performed.I highly recommend spending on watching the movie Aynabaji in theater, true masterpiece, absolutely worth it!9.5/10 and thanks for reading y'all :)",positive

Mucize,"First, let me list what I liked about this film. The setting is beautiful. Stark natural beauty of mountainous Eastern Turkey is breathtaking. Cinematography is also top notch. Local costumes, especially of the women are colorful, authentic and gorgeous. The subject matter, a city-bred grade school teacher is assigned to a remote mountain village where he assumes the self assigned task of rehabilitating a local spastic young man, has the potential of being developed into a powerful story. However, that is where my disappointment starts. The film blows the chance of being a masterpiece. The story development is choppy and full of unlikely events. At several points, I found myself asking 'but, why?' or 'how come?' and finding no explanation. The 'miracle' that is revealed at the end of the movie is probably the one plot element that is least believable. When the villagers wonder how the 'miracle' came about, the main character's explanation, 'I fell in love with my wife', just does not cut it. I admire the young Turkish director, Mahsun Kirmizigul, due to his productivity and improvement in his directing skills he has mustered over the years. Never the less, I believe he still has quite a distance to cover in order to perfect his artistry in story telling.",negative
Mucize,"This is my first review on IMDb. I loved many films but in no case was so motivated to write a review ! I went to ""Mucize"" (Miracle) with little bits expectations but I was truly overwhelmed with this superb story of Mahsun Kirmizigul. I can not remember another movie where I have cried more then this! It is about people who loves other people without expectations. It is about courage of a man who only wants that children go to school and therefore he moves from his city to a place what you can call ""the middle of nowhere""...It is about love what is defined as the key for reach your target...the film looks like real life. All of the characters have played very well but there is one person who have played his role SUPERB ! That is the crazy man : Aziz (Mert Turak) ! The character who plays te handicapped man with a truly amazing emotional bond with his horse. ( I have read somewhere that he has been lived 3 months with the horse to make this possible). He plays the character so perfect that I thought that he really was crazy / handicapped ! In the first half of the movie are so many good jokes that you can think it's a comedy. In the second half the film transforms in a emotional roller-coaster what's putting you in a story that is no more forgettable in your whole live ! A person, who is saying I own a heart, will cry ! There are also more Turkish films like, Eskiya (now in the top 250 of IMDb), babam ve oglum etc. what I can say they were very good but this peace of cinema from early singer Mahsun Kirmizigul is near PERFECT ! See it to believe it. 10 stars out of 10 !",positive
Badlapur,Movie Has No story Line.First Half Is Very Uninteresting And The Scenes Don't Link With each other. second half left every thing too apathetic. On the other hand movie struggles to make any sort of sense.Acting Of Varun Dhawan and Nawaz makes the movie bearable but the movie still isn't backed up by no story line. this movie tries to show a psycho-path but instead makes him a stupid unrealistic personality. watch the movie if you want to just watch a movie for the heck of it. believe me you won't regret not watching this movie. I will give a thumbs down to this movie. and only thing good in this movie is ActingI would not recommend this movie to any one except for Varun Fans as you may watch him in a new Avataar,negative
Badlapur,"From the first moment you set your eyes on the movie, you know that it's going to be highly stylish one. And it is! Not your Once Upon a Time in Mumbai sort of stylish. Rather stylish in truer and grittier sense.The characters were just fabulous. You don't know whom to call the victim and whom the culprit. Just an unfortunate event that sets off a chain reaction transforming every one in the process for the good or worse.The charms of the movie: Varun and Nawazuddin. The one I liked more was Varun for a very simple reason. Nawazuddin is an acclaimed actor though underrated. It's Varun who broke the stereotype chocolate boy image and got onto a new avatar. One that's disturbing and at the same time interesting. The only thing is, Varun's voice seemed childish in some scenes that demanded more impact. Other than that, Varun has my respect. Nawazuddin is Nawazuddin. I watch his every movie just to see him in action. Enough Said! The twists and turns in this movie seemed natural. Never forced. Unlike other bollywood movies, where the twists are introduced out of nowhere, this one had twists that baffled me with it's sheer brilliance. The gore is limited to just few minutes but enough to make a huge impact.The comedy is unintentional yet brilliant. The dialogues are not intended to make you laugh. But you laugh anyway. Even after the movie has ended. WOW! 2015 has been so good this far. Hope this continues for the rest of the year. Ugly, Baby, and now this.I'll not urge you to watch this movie if you like masala movies Or, if you intend to watch a family movie. But, if you want a taste of the nastier grittier stuff bollywood has to offer, I can't think of a better movie right now than this one.You'll either love this movie. Or, hate it. But this movie will definitely make an impact on you. That fer sure.",positive
I Am Not a Serial Killer,"I never review any films but I felt compelled to after having watched this absolute trash. I honestly have no idea why it has so many good reviews, this film is so inconsistent. The main character is diagnosed as being a sociopath yet he cares for everyone?!?! 90% of the film is filler, none of the scenes push the story forward, a plot didn't seem to exist. An hour into the film I checked to see how long it had been on for, I was gobsmacked it had only been on for 60 minutes, It felt like days had passed. The film was slow and cumbersome, the dialogue was ineffective and didn't contribute to the story line most of the time. I won't put any spoilers in, the main spoiler of the film is the fact it has spoilt my Sunday afternoon, I'm hungover and now I'm angry too. Please don't watch this film, you will just end up like me, bitter, twisted and disappointed.",negative
I Am Not a Serial Killer,"John Wayne Cleaver (Max Records) is a teen sociopath growing up in Clayton, Ohio. He has the traits of being a serial killer, but manages to keep his urges under control when pushed. His Mom runs the town's funeral home and he has access to dead bodies. The town does have a serial killer and John has a fascination with him, so much he does his own investigation.This is a dark humor horror film. We get to know the killer after a few kills. There is blood and body parts.I love these clever indie horror tales. They tend to have some unique element making formula guessing a film impossible. I also recommend ""Night of the Living Deb"" a comedy/zombie indie.Guide: No swearing that I recall. No sex or nudity.",positive
Bangalore Days,"Seriously, this movie is overrated. Nothing really happens in this movie. We've got three cousins and we're shown how they're spending their time. Each of them have got problems of their own and they try to sort it out. The acting is sub par with the only good performance done by Fahadh Faasil. Nivin pauly tries hard in comedy but does not succeed much. Dulquer tries to look menacing but does not come up to the mark. Nazriya is really bad. The story turns melodramatic and songs are there for no reason. Songs were actually good, but there is no context for these songs in the movie. And what's with putting the setting as Bangalore? Seriously, this story could've taken place in any of the cities of India. Kochi would've been fine. I won't say this is a complete failure. It is only overrated. If you have nothing else to do and is ready to see a movie which is all style and no substance, then watch this movie.",negative

They Call Me Jeeg,"Plain awful. Do anything else, throw marshmallows at stray dogs, pinch wallets, try to pee in a beer can, sell your body in parts. Anything is better than watching a badly acted and awfully written Kick-Ass/Hancock clone. Terrible B movie. At least Kick-Ass was funny and ironic, Hancock had great special effects, this dough is even trying to be dramatic. The only character building up throughout the movie is the loony girl, and she gets killed for no reason whatsoever. Her acting is dreadful (apparently she comes from a TV reality show), but her character is the only element of interest in the movie. Santamaria is just as wooden as Pinocchio. After she dies anybody else might as well turn into flaming zombies and bite everyone, you wouldn't give a rat's behind, anyway. The wooden puppet playing the bad guy should have been court martialed for his insanely bad acting. Steer clear, it is awful.",negative
They Call Me Jeeg,"A very good film, not afraid of showing on the screen the ugly people we are. This looked like a real National product to me, devoid of major foreign influences: it recalled much more of Pasolini's suburbs or of Pazienza's bad boys than of Deadpool or Kick-Ass. Which is something I liked very much.A catching opening scene, a solid plot, some very good actors and a great villain (Fabbio: Luca Marinelli won a David for this performance) will make you overlook some lack of craftsmanship in special effects or in action scenes.And originality is priceless. So sometimes is good to diverge from International main stream, I guess. Enjoy.",positive
Good Kill,"I found this movie to be very upsetting personally, having spent 20 years in the U.S. Military. This movie portrays military personnel and the military family in general in an extremely negative way. The movie is also written in a propaganda format that questions U.S. policies on the war on terror. It shows military personnel at high levels questioning their orders and actions on a daily basis and tensions within their ranks/unit because of that. The main character, played by Ethan Hawke, clearly needs help in many ways (not being specific purposely). To think that a senior officer wouldn't notice his behaviors and would continue to allow the character (a senior officer himself) to continue to fly drones and kill targets is ludicrous.",negative
Good Kill,"Good KillThe good thing about drones is they give little people pilots the chance to show their stuff.Oops, apparently the tiny aircraft in this drama are completely unmanned.With the advent of unmanned aerial vehicles, Air Force pilot Major Egan has found himself obsolete.Resigned to guiding the drones and initiating launch commands, Egan feels unsettled in domestic bliss with his wife (January Jones), longing to return to action.When the CIA starts assigning the missions, Egan loses even more of his integrity. Troubled by remote images of a Taliban soldier raping a servant woman, the ex-pilot tail spins out of control. One of few war films to confront the cowardly notion of drone strikes, and their effect on the soldier pressing the button, Good Kill features some good performances and poses some valid questions.In fact, the only people who can thwart these evil drones are R/C aircraft hobbyists.

Saaho,"Saaho...! There are so many problems with this movie that I don't even know where to start. There were so many times throughout the film where I wanted to laugh at how stupid everything was. That is how hilariously bad this movie is.I don't think there is any point trying to explain the storyline of this movie because it barely exists. The movie thinks it's so clever when it tries to wrap up everything at the end but without any logical sense, it comes across as painfully silly.There were so many things happening but nothing kept me invested or compelled throughout its 3 hour runtime. I really don't know what was going through writer-director Sujeeth's head because he failed to even get the basics right. The dialogues written were just cheesy one-liners that made me want to facepalm every time I heard one. The jokes were nowhere near funny. This movie itself is a giant joke.The writing is vastly incompetent. There barely was any character development from anyone. Shraddha Kapoor's character had some development but it wasn't enough for me to care about her. Prabhas's character unfolded literally at the end of the film but there was so much trash from the previous 2 hours 40 minutes that I just didn't care anymore. The only thought I had was to get up and leave. The gangsters portrayed didn't seem menacing at all because we don't learn much about them. Chunky Panday did feel threatening but he wasn't given anything to work with so he was just wasted.The acting was okay. No one really stood out to me since everyone was wasted potential. I thought the chemistry between Shraddha Kapoor and Prabhas was very unconvincing and dragged the film a lot.I kept on noticing how atrocious the editing was. To me, the background score was immensely obnoxious. This film takes itself so seriously and the loud score makes even more dramatic. The songs didn't do anything for the film's 'story' so in the end they were just unnecessary.Another thought that crossed my mind was ""Where did all of the money go?"". With a budget that high, you at least expect the film to look really good. The special effects are laughably bad. There is a scene involving a snake and the snake looks really fake. Parts of the action scenes seem very unbelievable because of the effects and how illogical they are. The scenery in the songs are nice to look at but they are irrelevant to the actual narrative.Saaho is one of the biggest disappointments of 2019. Pretty much everything in this movie is flawed. You ask for logic and don't get any of that. I just wish they wrote a better story with fleshed out characters so that we have something worth watching. Saaho is all style and no substance.",negative

Night Moves,"""You said no one would get hurt!"" -DenaI was not particularly excited going in to see this one but I was certainly interested, Night Moves is another of those movies that premiered a year ago at the Toronto Film Festival that are only now getting released in my country though this one has also taken a while to get it's release in the U.S. It was a year ago then that two films premiered at ""TIFF"" that stared Jesse Eisenberg, one of them was The Double and the other one was this one, both received good reviews, The Double continued to get it's share of talk while this one kind of was forgotten, still though I remembered the good early buzz that had continued throughout it's promotion so I still went ahead and saw it.Night Moves is Directed by Kelly Reichardt and it stars Dakota Fanning, Jesse Eisenberg, Alia Shawkat, Peter Sarsgaard, Katherine Waterston, James LeGros and Griffin Newman. "" Three radical environmentalists coming together to execute the most intense protest of their lives: the explosion of a hydroelectric dam-the very source and symbol of the energy-sucking, resource-devouring industrial culture they despise.""Night Moves is not a picture that I loved, I didn't it's no doubt flawed and I can see many getting way of this one but I got to say that this is a good little film that's being underseen. I am not familiar with director of the movie, I had heard about some of her pictures but she seems to be someone who divides audiences and I guess this is another picture that will divide audiences. It will not break audiences because it's weird or too complicated but because it's too simple and many will probably find it uninteresting and boring.Though the movie certainly has a slow pace I would disagree with those who say it is boring though I got to say that I would understand those people too because I feel there's a lack of character development. I'm not saying they should have gone with some cheap clichéd sh*t and put up a background on the characters but they could have made a bit more effort. We are never truly able to understand these guys, their motivations seem awfully weak, they are basically people who want to protect the environment and all that jazz but the fact is that the movie's tone is much bleaker, these characters are completely alienated, especially Jesse's and we never get the sense of why. They basically are acting like terrorists doing some ""Mickey Mouse"" job that doesn't really have a great deal of importance in the big scheme of things but they take it like they are revolutionizing the world and I think that made it kind of confusing for the audience.It was also confusing what happens afterwards, I mean was it really that surprising that someone got injured or killed, I mean that blew up a f*cking dam like tough guys but then they couldn't handle the consequences of their job that was ultimately successful. I mean this collapsing of the characters in the afterwards of the job is certainly an interesting character study on guilt, on fear and on redemption and I think it's handled quite beautifully but I still I couldn't help but to feel confused. It's kind of a paradox because that made me feel confused but it also helped me relate with the characters because they are no big timers they are just normal people, with good intentions and a heart and it's very interesting to their reacting to the consequences or their actions, their reactions aren't from a gangster where he doesn't feel anything, this the way probably a normal person would react.The film takes it very slowly but then again it's never boring even though the movie is never really exciting or thrilling it's always at least engaging and an interesting watch and certainly quite tense to. It's a very intense film with doubt and I got to applaud the director for creating such a mood where you feel trapped, claustrophobic, very gloomy and heavy. It's a very simple story with few twists in it, very straight forward and there are not a great many deal of surprises but again I say the movie is always very tense and there's quite an emotional complexity to it all.The performances certainly helped. Peter Sarsgaard is such a great actor, very underrated, good in everything he's been and unfortunately he's face doesn't bring audiences and because of that he usually is not given big roles, here he does have a good little role that he plays well, not a great deal of showy scenes where he lets loose his talent but still worth mentioning. Dakota Fanning is still seen as a child by many, such as myself, but the fact is that she's already taking big roles such as this one with a performance that I'm not going to lie, impressed me. She's great in this though she's not the star of the movie. The star of the film is Academy Award Nominee, Jesse Eisenberg, who gives he's best performance since The Social Network. What a good performance, very contained performance, as a seemingly shy, quiet, lonely, alienated young fella. He almost reminded me of Travis, this guy is really quite sick, very paranoid, it seems like he's always cooking up something and I mean those last 25 minutes just showcase Eisenberg's talent, he here proves that The Social Network wasn't just luck.Night Moves is a simple yet beautifully made picture, with a slow pace but gut wrecking intensity at times and performances that alone are worth your while, it also raises up some interesting questions like ""when do legitimate convictions truly demand illegal violent behavior?"" and a good meditation on consequences when it comes to political extremist acts. See it!Rating:B-",negative
Night Moves,"Way too many negative reviews of this excellent production of cinematic art! I must speak out and state my opinion of this movie. It has little to do with radical environmentalism, as so many believe. Instead it is a story that deals with the lack of guilt and then the overwhelming feeling of remorse for a wrong committed.The plot line is about three idealistic youths who are too immature to realize the consequences of their actions in creating a destructive environmental statement . Director Kelly Reichardt has Jesse Eisenberg as 'Josh', Dakota Fanning as 'Dena', and Peter Sarsgaard as 'Harmon'. Josh, Dena, and Harmon are best described as politically committed environmentalist. We are not given much information on each characters background, we know they are sensitive individuals because they care about the natural process of things around them. The Harmon character is the wild card and the leader of the other two. Harmon has a military background which makes him suspect from the start - if he cared about the environment why would he join the military - which is more about destruction than preservation.Their idea to destroy a dam is half baked at best because it is made clear, after the fact, that destroying one dam on the river is futile as there are many dams along the course of the river. When Josh, Dena, and Harmon realize this they are consumed by regret for their foolish action and the fear of being caught. Harmon tells them to communicate in no way. Harmon disappears, Dena becomes a nervous wreck as shown by her case of hives, and Josh becomes paranoid and irrational.Night Moves is a study in the human condition. We as individuals seldom consider the far reaching consequences of our hateful actions, and individuals create societies, societies create nations. I believe Kelly Reichardt has made a clear statement on our world today. Just because this story only shows the actions of three people their actions had far reaching consequences on innocent others. The same statement can be made about nations and their actions against other nations. And what is achieved in the end - destruction, death, fear, and paranoia.At the end of the movie we see Josh becoming a nonperson and having to look over his shoulder from fear. In the mirror he has no reflection but he can see other people. Who's friend and who's foe?",positive
Mary and the Witch's Flower,"This got three stars because it does have beautiful animation and they did a really amazing magical land but outside of that nothing about it was that good. The story fell flat and became contradictory. I was waiting for something to happen and to be excited but that feeling never came. There were two plots in the film that we're completely contradictory. First she shows up at the school and the headmistress is like ""we have been watching you for a long time now"" but also doesn't know she's the niece of the woman who tried to destroy her or that she has never used magic before that day? What?Second being Mary has a set amount of magic? And she's constantly 'almost out' but can still destroy an entire science lab when she's suppose to be completely out? And how does everyone around her know how much magic she has left and not her? And how does she have a limited amount of magic when her aunt is this powerful witch?Music didn't stand out as either amazing or dull just eh.Characters and dialoge was also so flat. Seriously just plain awful at points.",negative
Mary and the Witch's Flower,"Just came back from the one time only screening of this movie in Austin TX. I'm a bit confused by the super-negative reviews of this film. I guess people were expecting a film on par with past Studio Ghibli movies? Lets be real here, as sad as it is, the age of Studio Ghibli is over, unless Hayao Miyazaki decides to return to the directors seat and make another full-length feature film. Which at this point seems unlikely. The fact that we have a studio like Ponoc to carry on the torch of 2D animated projects in the style of Gibli should be celebrated I think. I went into this movie not expecting it to be on par with any of Studio Ghibli's past works, yes it's no Howl's Moving Castle or Spirited Away. I did enjoy Mary and the Witch's Flower more so than Miyazaki's last two films, The Wind Rises and Ponyo. The only other Hiromasa Yonebayashi films I've seen was Arriety, never saw When Marine Was There. I do think this film is better than Arriety was.Mary and the Witches Flower looks like a Studio Ghibli film, the character animation is really great, the backgrounds, while reminiscent of past Ghibli works are nice, but not on the same level of detail, which was fine to me. The characters and the story is good, again, not as solid as past Ghibli works, but I enjoyed it overall. The biggest thing lacking to be was a musical score from Joe Hisaishi, but he has never done music for a Hiromasa Yonebayashi film. The last film he composed music for was The Princess Kaguya, which was a big deal. I'm getting off-track here, but the last I will say is that is if you are a fan of Studio Ghibli, and are yearning to see a full-length feature film in traditional 2D animation, go see this film if you are able to, just don't go in expecting it to be as good as one of the Studio Ghibli classics.",positive
Journey to the West,"Warning: Spoilers This movie is a disaster with its horribly random script, flat characters, terrible CGI, and an unbelievable romance.So let's talk SCRIPT. This should be easy, because there isn't one. The story follows the exploits of a young demon hunter as he hunts down three demons: water and pig demon, and the Monkey King. There is no set up to each encounter as the title character Xuan Zang tends to show up out of the blue, do battle, fail, and get saved by a better demon hunter Miss Duan. That's how each fight transpires from start to finish over the course of a 2 hour movie. We never really learn much about the title characters or a handful of minor characters who randomly appear and disappear. The whole movie and the threat of these demons is just glossed over for special effect and battle pieces that get rather boring by the end of the film.Xuan Zang is the lead—a demon hunter who believes in reforming demons rather than killing them, but we never learn why. There are no flashbacks or character development to lead us to understand why he thinks so differently about the monsters. He's a typical Chow innocent, almost exactly like Chow's character in a dozen of his previous movies. He is horrible at what he does until the end when he finally rises to the occasion.Second central character is Miss Duan (the love interest). She appears to help him out against the water demon and then appears out of nowhere when he tries to fight the pig demon. All we know about her is that she isn't an innocent as she kills whoever steps in her path and doesn't know how to flirt or express herself without using her fist. She travels the world with her sister and a couple hired goons that we only see once in a prolonged sequence in the middle of the movie. Like everyone else in this movie we never learn enough about them to care.I understand this is a comedy/action/fantasy movie, but enough character background and development has to be done for us to root for them and sadly, there wasn't. When people start to die at the end—you don't care.The CGI is laughably bad. I'll be honest, during the sequence with the water demon (by far the best part of the whole film) the effects looked great. The water demon looked fantastic, but the pig, the green screen sets, and the over-the-top ending are just so cartoon and obviously fake that it takes away from the film.One of the biggest problems for the film is the forced romance between the central characters. There is no chemistry between them. Miss Duan follows Xuan Zang to each of his encounter with the demons to ensure his safety and when the battle is over tries to get him to confess he loves her, which is something he never does until the ending. She gets rejected, if I remember correctly, 3 or 4 times before (SPOILER WARNING) he finally admits to loving her for 10,000 years as she dies! This romance had about as much heat and passion in it as Twilight. I couldn't believe how flat and forced it was with no payoff.But there are more crimes against this movie which just annoyed me to no end—blatant stealing of items from other Stephen Chow movies. Now part of me believes that Stephen Chow didn't direct this whole movie—in fact, you can see that there are two directors.The Water Demon sequence is about 15 to 20 minutes long and is on a beautifully constructed set—similar to the one found in Kung Fu Hustle. The humor here is excellent, the camera shots, the tension, the drama, everything works perfectly. I was thrilled to be watching one of my favorite Chinese directors hit his mark and exceed. However, after that sequence and a short encounter with Xuan Zang's teacher, Buddha in earthly form, the film falls apart and the ripping off begins. Here are some examples: 1.) The Nursery Rhyme Book: in this film, Xuan Zang uses a book of nursery rhymes in an attempt to bring out the goodness in the demons. Other demon hunters laugh at him and mock him from using it, which later turns out to be a very powerful weapon against the Monkey King. In Kung Fu Hustle it's the same thing—main character buys a book of Kung Fu from a guy, everyone thinks it's a joke, but later on he realizes how to use and becomes a great Kung Fu master.2.) The score from this movie comes from Kung Fu Hustle.3.) Prince Important uses magic swords to fight in the exact same way as the blind music killers from Kung Fu Hustle.4.) (SPOILERS) Buddha kills the Monkey King with the Palm Stephen Chow's character in Kung Fu Hustle used to defeat the villain.All these factors lead me to believe that Stephen Chow directed the first part and was basically helping with the film rather than directing. If I am wrong, then it's a sad day when you see such comedic genius fall so far from grace. If you want to see a hilarious Stephen Chow movie about the Journey to the West see his old movies instead.The last thing I will mention is the endingoh man, what a joke! (SPOILERS) In the end, the three demons join our main character as he travels to the west to spread the word of Buddha—but why would you want to see the continued adventures of a demon who ate a little girl, a demon that had a hotel used to lure travelers so he could eat them, or a Monkey King who ripped a guy's throat out and killed the main characters love?",negative
Journey to the West,"Fortunately, the movie packs Stephen Chow's comedic style, or I would call it contains his soul. There's Chow's usual style of comedy, action, love story, and some meaning behind life. Well, what more is needed in a blockbuster movie? Unfortunately, nothing is perfect. I went into the cinema without any expectation, and I didn't read any reviews so I could enjoy the whole movie as if I was the first to do so. I understand that Chow directed this movie, and even demonstrated to retain the ""feel"" of his usual style. Still, I find the first 15 minutes of the movie to be a little dry in terms of humor. As the protagonist enters the scene it was a bit difficult for me to laugh. However, as the story unfolds, and as the mainstream humor pours in, laughter floods the cinema wave after another. To add, the protagonist's wacky hair style, does resemble Chow in some ways.The CGI is of top quality, I can see the movie spending a lot of money on CGI. Many of the scenes contain a lot of visual detail and picturesque grounds. The music is familiar and lovely, I shall not reveal too much.Show Luo's appearance in this movie was like his usual funny-self in his TV entertainment news. I would appreciate it more if he would have neglected his usual style and adopted a new one. It's not a bad thing, but it's not a good thing too, it lies somewhere on the neutral side. I guess on the good side, his fans will love to see him.Trying my best not to disclose too much. This movie is a prequel to his previous 2 part movie, ""A Chinese Odyssey Part One: Pandora's Box, and A Chinese Odyssey Part Two: Cinderella."" The essence of this movie is how it somehow relates to ""A Chinese Odyssey"" in terms of how life is, in its cycle. The feelings the protagonist experienced in this movie is similar to what his disciple experienced in ""A Chinese Odyssey"". The good news for those who haven't seen ""A Chinese Odyssey"", is that you can watch this movie on its own.Lastly, there are some tear-jerking scenes. My eyes welled up at some parts, but I stayed a man. I would give this a 9.5 out of 10 because of its imperfection, but the scores only allow whole numbers. So.... enjoy the movie.",positive
Arif V 216,"Boring.
Yes it was really boring. I could not leave the theatre before the end since it was not free.

Arif V 216,"As being unconfident with the visual effects or some technical details, Turkish movie makers keep themselves away from this genre. Even if there is no problem with the technical issues, it is very salty to take it. Thus, they can't venture.Additionally, most of the Turkish people are not interested in science fiction. They prefer comedy movies with cheap jokes or drama movies in which there is a love between a rich and a poor.However, this movie is a fruit with the taste of drama, comedy, and science fiction, but shaken, not stirred.",positive
Ugly,"This movie left you with the feeling of numb .Ugly sets a new dimension to the Indian Cinema . I am not a frequent watcher of Bollywood movies.But ugly movie is just beyond the ugliness of everything. A grungy, dark police procedural set in motion by a little girl's kidnapping, Ugly has few discernible auteur touches to set it apart from standard genre fare. Gone are the farcical, hyperbolic violence and the larger-than-life, tongue-in-cheek gangsters who modeled themselves on the movies. Gone is the wacky humor. Here the pettiness, egotism and corruption of modern Mumbai rule and the characters are all cheap and small—even the kidnapping victim is annoying. There may be a method here but if so, the result is very dark and downbeat for general audiences. The film's Cannes outing and Kashyap's cult standing could give it a little shelf life at festivals before it heads into genre venues. The cast of characters is presented haphazardly. Shalini (Tejaswini Kolhapure) is a desperate, middle-class housewife kept at home as a semi-prisoner by her macho police-chief husband Bose (Ronit Roy). She's about to blow her brains out with his gun when a knock on the door stops her. It's her daughter Kali (Anishika Shrivastava), whining for her to call her estranged father. This is Rahul (Rahul Bhatt), a down-and-out actor still waiting for his big break, who comes to take her for a drive. He's so distracted with phone calls he barely looks at her, and then he ominously leaves her alone in the car while he goes to talk business with his friend and casting director Chaitanya (Vineet Kumar Singh). Within minutes the girl is missing. Rahul becomes the hero by default as he searches for the girl, first through the police, then following the kidnappers' ransom messages. What little sympathy he inspires in the audience comes from his terrifying interview with local police captain Jadhav (played with gusto by the fine comic actor Girish Kulkarni). Instead of launching a manhunt for the girl, the captain absurdly chats about CELL PHONES and computers while the distraught Rahul chafes and Chaitanya attempts to cajole him into action. All at once, Jadhav realizes the missing girl is the stepdaughter of police honcho Bose, and his attitude switches to FBI pro. At this point the stone-faced Bose, who hates his wife's ex, orders him to accuse Rahul of the kidnapping and be beaten senseless. The rest of the film is a battle of wits between Bose and Rahul to find the girl while tripping up the other. Rahul and Chaitanya are monotonously arrested and rearrested. Police violence is graphic and frightening. They use the ""latest"" gadgets in their investigation— computers, CELL PHONES and GPS—like they were major novelties on CSI: Miami, which makes it seem the film is aimed mainly at local audiences. There is, however, a continuous sense of vitality and movement in the film, whose action scenes are foot chases filmed from a distance. Kashyap's nasty point is that, between violence, greed and corruption, just about no one is innocent in the end. Certainly all the characters are selfish beyond belief. This existential cynicism hits home in the horrific crime revealed in the last shot, but by that time, the emotions feel light-years away.",negative
Ugly,"Anurag Kashyap yet again proves that he is in a league by himself among accomplished Bollywood directors. Lately in Bollywood there has been a surge in talented writers/directors creating movies that steer away from typical Bollywood glitz, glamor and grandeur. These glamorous movies appeal to the delusions of most of the Indian audience. But audience who take movies as a form of art and source for inspiration can see through the bling and realize that the substance is utterly lacking. Writers/Directors like Kashyap do not have audience in their mind when they create movies, they cater their work for themselves, which in my opinion brings the best out of any creator of art.Ugly is a tale of ordinary lives involved in extraordinary circumstances. It starts out with a missing child followed by sequences that will make you utterly hate some characters initially. But as the movie unfolds and characters develop on screen, opinions on most of the characters will gradually change. This is a rarity in Bollywood movies, because many of them have characters that are purely good or evil. There is no middle ground, everything is looked as black or white and 30 minutes into the movie you can predict the plot by connecting dots between good and bad characters. But what if you start watching a movie where characters are constantly evolving on screen and every character has some evil and some nobility to him? That is when things become unpredictable and keep you on the edge of your seat if it is a thriller like this story is.Greed and desperation, combined with poverty has a way of bringing out monsters in people you would usually deem as normal. Let me go ahead and say that you will find no character likable in the movie. Correction, I liked all the characters, but I could not root for any of them. But if I had to make an exception I would say one character would come out in a positive light by the end of the movie, even if there is some evil to him/her.This movie is very condensed and concentrated with many raw, heavy hitting scenes that prompt vivid reactions from expressive audience. The plot is captivating and progresses linearly, with some retrospection in-between. Kashyap manages to have his audience on the edge of their seats 15 minutes into the movie. If you are a sucker for suspense thrillers like I am, you wont be leaning back for the rest of the movie. Kashyap also compels you to empathize and cringe at the plight and despair of characters, a lot of which is brought onto them by themselves. Kashyap is a master at writing characters and finding impeccable actors to bring them to life. The lack of make up combined with many improvised scenes give a ""real life"" rawness and experience you are not used to in Bollywood movies. The movie ""Apocalypse Now"" where the character played by Marlon Brando talks about ""the horror"" is a scene that resonates deeply with audience. That was an improvised scene played by Brando who hardly could remember the lines and thus improvised in front of cameras to give us arguably the greatest scene ever. Kashyap obviously understands the positives of improvisation and lets his extremely talented cast do their thing. I only hope these actors get the recognition they deserve.All in all, Ugly is the best Bollywood has to offer for the year 2014. I can confidently say that without even watching 99% of Hindi movies that came out in 2014. It is entertaining and inspiring. I wish I could meet Mr. Kashyap in person and thank him for all the wonderful creations. He is one of the very few reasons I still bother with Bollywood. I wish he managed to squeeze in Kay Kay Menon and Manoj Bajpai somewhere, that is the only (silly) complaint I have about this movie.",positive
Chhapaak,"The story could be accurate but it sadly isn't. The lawyer in real life events was given no real credit for her fight ! But let's forget the facts for a moment and enjoy the movie one would think ... The direction is poor and the movie feels like something emotionally charged than a message. Honestly a one time watch movie and you wouldn't be able to handle it another time ! Here's a suggestion for south indians with a similar storyline... Watch the malayalam movie ""Uyare"" and you'll be much more satisfied than this supposedly true story !!
But hey ! This movie will make you rethink about everything that's wrong with our cheap minded society !! Watch it for a message...ignore it for the facts !!",negative

A Perfect Day,"Well, I called it. As soon as I saw the trailer, the only word I could think of was 'aimless'. And sure enough, the ironically titled A Perfect Day, turns out to be a not so perfect day at the theatre. The film tries desperately to combine road trip elements with social commentary on warfare and aid workers in Balkan conflict zones, but the end result is boring and pointless, an unbalanced mess of ideas. Road trip? More like road tripe. Mambrú (Benicio del Toro) is overseeing the removal of a fat corpse from a well 'somewhere in the Balkans' as the film puts it. The rotting corpse doesn't exactly help things on the sanitary front, as you can imagine. Like my patience, the rope is wearing thin and rope snaps. So begins a trip across the countryside to secure some new rope. He is joined by his rather eccentric partner, B (Tim Robbins, who's sporting the biggest, most unnatural looking set of pearly whites I've ever seen), new blood Sophie, a translator, and an old flame, Katya (Olga Kurylenko). Along the way, they'll meet people, bump into the U.N., etc. I can't sum it up much better than that.I'll get right down to it: this movie is so terribly balanced I'd almost say it suffers from bipolar disorder. I get that it tries to combine the appeal of a road trip movie with some serious storytelling, but it just never works. You jump from a zany scene to a sad one, all the while questioning how you're supposed to take any of it seriously. A perfect example: early on, when the new girl Sophie sees the body in the well, she freaks out in a way that feels like it should elicit laughter: 'haha, that's cute, she's not used to bodies yet.' Mambrú and B's reactions seem to confirm this. Later, Mambrú and Sophie are in a ruined house looking for rope. Sophie opens a door, but doesn't notice a body hanging behind her. Mambrú tries to spare her the trauma, but Sophie of course sees the body and freaks out. She freaks out in the same way again, but this time it's supposed to be taken seriously. But how can I take it seriously when the film was using her reaction for laughs earlier? Other examples include the gang driving through the mountains as rock music plays, when suddenly we get a scene where they have to drive away from soldiers rounding up people to be shot; A major subplot involves Mambrú and Katya who used to be lovers. Mambrú's surprised by her appearance and they have some conversations where they dance around the issue. Despite seeing someone else, he still has feelings for her, although he wouldn't admit to this. The same goes for her. Watching their banter is about as interesting as you'd expect, but in the end it doesn't contribute anything to the plot nor does B contribute anything except a few laughs. Sophie goes from oblivious newbie to 'having learned the ways of the world', but it's not the focus of the film, so why should I care? Needless to say, the acting, while decent, cannot save this walking identity crisis. Not even Tim Robbins and his great white teeth can save it. It's not a case of the actors failing the movie, but the movie failing the actors. It's the kind of experience where, instead of being absorbed by the *clears throat* 'drama', you're trying to peek inside the actors' heads and wonder what's really going through their minds.I can see what the filmmakers were going for, but the few scenes that bordered on interesting just made me wish they didn't waste their time with boring romances and botched attempts at road trippy humor and instead took things a little more seriously. There are poignant scenes, like the one where Mambrú struggles with his own uselessness when attempting to help others. Here, notions of helping others on a large or small scale, bureaucracy, usefulness, etc. are all touched upon, but the film's all-over-the-place attitude prevents you from taking it as seriously as you'd want to. Right when the credits started rolling, there were high school kids in the front row clapping. Pray for them, dear reader. Pray for them.",negative
A Perfect Day,"M*A*S*H in Bosnia? It centres around Mambru (Benicio del Toro) and B (Tim Robbins), a couple of aid workers in the Balkans during the conflict of the 90s. Working with an NGO known as Aid Across Borders, they deal with the horrors of the war and the vicious consequences of ethnic hatred almost on a daily basis. The film begins with the pair trying to raise a morbidly obese body from a well in a remote village before it can contaminate the water supply. A lack of suitable rope hampers their mission thus setting them off in search of equipment. Further complications arise when the UN administration specifically forbids them to remove the body for fear of upsetting the locals. The UN adviser who is compiling a report on the team's efficiency is ""conflict evaluator"" Katya (former Bond girl Olga Kuylenko), who had a relationship with Mambru that ended badly. Tension is in the air as they set off with their interpreter Damir (Fedja Stukan) and new recruit Sophie (Melanie Thierry) on a journey that reveals some of the horror of war. And Nikola (Eldar Reisdovic), an orphan boy they come across, puts a more human face on the carnage and adds a more sympathetic element to the material. A Perfect Day is the first English language feature for Spanish director Fernando Leon de Aranoa (Barrio, Familia, etc), and he maintains a light touch throughout. He mixes black humour with an exploration of the absurdity of military authority and the futility of war. Black humour at the expense of military authority and the helplessness of the UN is reminiscent of the classic M*A*S*H. In one of his better performances for some time Robbins is excellent here with his irreverent sense of humour and acerbic observations, while Del Toro's swarthy presence, cynicism and ironic detachment adds gravitas. Their banter is amusing, and alleviates some of the tension of the dramatic journey through this war torn countryside. Alex Catalan's superb cinematography of the arid mountain landscapes and war devastated backdrop further enhances this enjoyable comedy/drama. This ironically titled pitch black comedy has been one of the early highlights of MIFF.",positive
Extinction,"The zombie genre has been bled dry, nothing new there; there is literally nothing new anyone can eke anymore out of it to make another great zombie flick. I certainly haven't seen a good zombie flick in over a decade. Instead of being creative by coming up with new creepy concepts, the vast majority of ""film-makers"" are content to milk the last molecules out of zombie and vampire genres. Only two adults (at the outset) are left in the world – yet they don't talk. That's a whole new level of dumb they're trying to sell, just so they can do injustice to that overrated movie term called ""dramatic conflict"". The notion that these two guys won't talk due to something that occurred eons ago, regarding some floozy from years back, is too stupid. It just doesn't wash. No matter what argument or hatred is going on between grown men, an extraordinary situation such as a zombapocalypse should have brought them together, at least to the point where they can talk and grudgingly co-operate. Beggars can't be choosers, yet the writer thinks they can. People forgive each other under much less stressful conditions, when they don't have to, let alone in an unpopulated, frozen wasteland in which co-operation is essential to survival.What's with this ""double whammy"" apocalypse anyway? We've got a zombapocalypse AND a new ice age! I'd be curious to know WHY a zombie virus would cause such a radical shift in global temperature. Any explanations, movie? No explanation. Movie refuses to discuss this matter with me. Movie knows it's wrong. Movie is a dummie. If anything, there should be global warming, not an ice age. Here's why: since zombies eat much more than humans (bless their wicked metabolism) – and yet remain skinny – this means they must do the brownie much more often than humans. The logical conclusion is that they fart more – which in turn would make the planet warmer, not colder. Am I right or am I right?Nor can I accept the fact that TWO major events occur at the SAME day, after nine years of relative monotony: first the hippie gets attacked by a new breed of zombie, only to be contacted by radio minutes later - for the FIRST TIME in nine years – by another survivor. That's coincidenceitatis being brought to a level of absurdity that's an insult to viewers, even zombie viewers many of whom are not unlike the movie's zombies themselves.It gets better. The little girl, who had been obedient for so many years, not leaving the grounds as ordered, suddenly decided it was OK to go for a NIGHT stroll – only a day after seeing a zombie for the first time! So let me get this right, movie: BEFORE seeing any ""live"" zombies, the girl didn't have that much interest in venturing outside, but as soon as she witnessed a zombie attack her neighbour, she somehow found that ENCOURAGING? ""Hmmm, I used to think it wasn't safe leaving the house, but now that I've seen an alien-looking, deformed, vicious zombie with huge teeth attack another human right in front of my eyes – to which I reacted with shock, dismay and disgust - now I guess it's OK to go out. It's much safer out there with a zombie on the loose."" Great logic, movie. Are we to believe all 9 year-olds are completely retarded, devoid of even the most basic survival instincts?Still, at least she isn't dumb enough to have herself locked up in a basement; but that's precisely what her guardian does. There's hardly an experienced film fan that didn't see THAT stupid plot-device leading to the girl's endangerment.Just exactly who or what threatens our less-than-merry bunch? A bunch of freakin' gollums, that's what. In recent years a dull fad has engulfed the world of horror flicks, a fad that is making many of them a lot less interesting: the gollum trend. We've seen gollum-like monsters in the overrated ""Descent"", we've seen them in ""The Hallow"", in ""From the Dark"", and many other recent monster movies. Must we have the SAME kind of monsters in every film?Besides, if these zombie gollums evolved during the new ice age, shouldn't they have grown fur at least? No: the movie thinks it makes more sense to make them totally hairless! Now, that's a logical evolution right there. Darwin would be laughing his ass off. Clearly, American screenwriters have devolved to the state of an amoeba, because so few of them think anymore. Horror, fantasy, and sci-fi films are getting dumber with every new generation of devolved film-makers.It mystifies me why the survivors have to resort to hand-to-hand combat with the gollums when they'd previously armed themselves to the hilt. And when they do finally get to shoot the gollums, they run out of ammo! I mean, here we have a world in which time is the one commodity the humans have in abundance, yet they never actually bothered to make sure they have sufficient supplies of ammunition. This is the kind of nonsense I'm talking about, a clear indicator that screenwriters have devolved from average morons who made average movies in the 40s and 50s to the sub-par imbeciles who never run through a script more than 2-3 times before submitting it to some daft director.",negative
Extinction,"This movie could have been so much more. it had all the elements to end up a masterpiece, but for whatever reasons the actions seem incomplete. The potential in this movie was beyond awesome, unfortunately they only scratched the surface.The beginning of the movie wasn't all that promising but once I had a view at the first snow creature I was amazed how well it looked.. from afar. Once they got close, it lost all the fear that got me excited at first. I'm not saying they did a bad job, but the effects and costumes felt outdated and unpolished.The acting was above average, even though some character decisions were sloppy here and there, never the less the movie did connect with the human touch after 9 years of survival in the wilderness with 2 men and a child.The plot is unique and original but a bit rushed, maybe too many elements were included and there wasn't enough time to explore them in depth and evolve a better bond between them. One solid example would be the radio voices that were suggesting dementia, but they were there only for a few minutes in the movie then they weren't mentioned at all.The movie is worth watching, even though the ending was kind of messy with little information what was going on. Maybe one day someone will try to remake it into something better and add more refined details that were skipped or rushed in this movie.",positive

Borgman,"I'm still not quite sure what the film is trying to say, what it is about, it does seem like it is saying something, but in a way that is only logical within the film itself. If that makes any sense. It's a dark film about some people taking over some other people without getting to know why. It all happens in a designer house and a large garden surrounded by nature, forest. The further you go along in this puzzle (which tends to be quite slow in the first half and more paced in the second half), the more you understand what's going on but only cause you see a plan being revealed but still not knowing really what the goal is, or the meaning. It never get's explained fully but this tension is what keeps you watching it. At times brutal, funny and reflective upon society towards certain members who are let's say, not so fortunate vs the fortunate. In a way, it's payback time to those who have it all and don't know what they've got. Not sure that covers it all. At the end of the film I did feel a sense of conclusion and awe of it all, not knowing exactly what I just saw, just knowing I liked being played for the duration of this work. Would like to see it again.",negative
Borgman,"One of the best films of the Philadelphia Film Festival, Borgman is a hilarious, darkly satirical, mysterious, sexy, fascinating, and surreal allegory for social upheaval.In the beginning, there was armed men looking to kill underground hobos. We will never find out why they want to kill them or why the hobos are underground (or why the hobos have nice cellphones). One of them, Camiel Borgman, escapes and warns his friends. He washes himself at a gas station and begins wandering down an extremely affluent street with the intention of getting a proper bath in one of them, simply by asking at the front door. One house in particular strikes his fancy, and he begins a slow process of worming his way into the household and the lives of everyone who lives there.But that's when things get REALLY strange.This film is destined for hopefully a good deal of international attention in the art-house circuit due to its exceptional storytelling, unpredictability and very weird plot.With the matter-of-fact way it presents absurd goings-on, it reminded me of Dogtooth a little.",positive

Wetlands,"I instantly knew that this film was written and directed by men, because the female characters, including Helen, the main character, lack any credibility to me, as a woman. I also felt that the shock factor was only used to make money, not really to achieve any artistic or philosophical depth. It's difficult to shock these days, the film does it by an (excessive) exposure of all kinds of body fluids and dirt, to the point of boredom. I also felt that the main character was shallow and not likable in any way. I'm a big fan of Lars von Trirer and nothing of that which is human is alien to me. But this felt like a desperate call for attention, rather than a valuable (while shocking) cinema.",negative
Wetlands,"I am a student and admirer of the works Antoine Artaud and am very pleased to see a movie breathing the spirit of my second favorite insane Frenchman. This movie is aimed at the idiots who think they have to bear children. The body fluids and bleeding assholes are metaphors for what happens in the minds of children of infantile parents. I'm not big on symbolism in movies, but this thing a Bosch puzzle, it just goes on an on.. Four guys jerking off in a pizza, I think it's brilliant, think about it, what do these parents feed their kids spiritually? Crap topped with crap. It is no wonder says she has had herself sterilized because she doesn't want any kids. The sad and also - in a perverted way - beauty of the end is that, life repeats itself. The asshole represents the circle of life. This is what Fassbinder would make if he would be alive. Have you paid attention to the face lines of this woman? It's very similar to Fassbinder's heroins.

Dilwale,The script for this was written by a 6 year old who watched too many Hollywood. That is the only way I can interpret this movie. More that half of this movie is CARS and then some Michael Bay sh*t. The song locations or songs not make any sense.I like SRK and Kajol as couple but I never expected that they will act in such a movie. Even half the dialogs were reference to other movies. The action scenes were too short for enjoyment. If you go too deep in movie for logic (I always do because I want good logic in a good movie) then you will bang your head against the wall.My conclusion is that if you are looking to waste 2h 38m of your time and to see the return of SRK and Kajol jodi then go watch the film. But if you're looking for a good story or at least a logical film then really don't waste your money or your time. Thank you!,positive
Dhoom 3,"Aamir Khan dons the helmet this time and sets on thrilling escapes. Chase is the buzz word in Dhoom. Instead of being called action films, Dhoom movies fit the description of adventure. There is an underlying socialist theme: the corporate domination, the exploitation of common people by banks, their arbitrary attitude, prejudice and so much. It's a circus guy's battle against a bank. A common man versus establishment. Three chases are almost enough. One more would have been better. It doesn't matter that they don't show how the banks were robbed. The chases are so well executed that it doesn't matter. The circus stunts during the chases are awesome. Full points for that.The suspense-buster scene is directed with sheer brilliance. Aamir makes it special with a great performance. ACP Jai Dixit has shades of gray. He too is a part of the ""system"" like Anderson and the bank. The ending is a sad commentary on our society, deeply moving with love between two brothers.",negative
Dhoom 3,"Sometimes in cinema it is difficult to live up to hype. However, Dhoom 3 exceeds all expectations by packing a solid punch. The start was excellent and emotional, propped up by great performances from Jackie Shroff and Sidharth Nigam, the kid who plays young Aamir. YRF were indeed fortunate to find a kid who is not only a gymnast but a talented actor. I thought the cruel bank guy was good in his small part. He should've got a longer part. After the hasty Iqbal (Jackie) commits suicide, his son decides to take revenge. He targets the bank using his circus tricks and incredible gymnastics.As good as Aamir acts, he gets a very good script here that gets the best out of him. The ""dhoom"" scenes i.e. the chases are awesome. Modern cameras and VFX effects make them even better.Aamir's acting gets better and better as the story progresses. This is one one hell of a job by Aamir, on par with his best works.*****SPOILERS AHEAD*****To be frank, ACP Jai Dixit has become a liability since Dhoom 2 because his character makes things redundant. Since Dhoom 2 had a happy ending, his pesky interruptions didn't matter. But in Dhoom 3 the ending is sad, just because they had to give leverage to his character. Alas! they miss out on many tricks. Sahir's mastery and the twists around his characters are so good that he could have easily toppled Jai. Alas! Jai's character needs face saving because he's supposed to be one of the principal characters. He comes across as a big time nuisance.The whole angle about Jai called by US police to help them is hard to fathom. But we understand it's ""dhoom"" and some level of cinematic liberty has to be taken to involve a story like this in Chicago because it's hard to visualize this story on the streets of India.",positive
Bajirao Mastani,"One of the best performance by Bansali Sir Ever . Project it as the third spin off from a trilogy started from Hum dil de chuke sanam and Devdas where Salman and Shahrukh Stealed the show , but here Deepika did .Ranveer and Priyanka were lovely to watch but Deepika was far better . Belonging to such a strong and non-entertaining genre , it did entertained us and I will highly recommend you to watch this .Some may have rated it down (Fan wars or something) but believe me , it will show a spike and gradually may end up around 8 or something .Deserves your bucks and after watching it , you will for sure oblige Bhansali Sir to the magic he brought back that was missing from Bollywood for the past few years .Story 9/10 Songs 9/10 Dialogues 10/10 Acting 9/10 Direction 10/10Overall 9/10",negative
Bajirao Mastani,"This movie had already garnered expectations of epic proportions due to the cast, crew and the director, Mr. Sanjay Leela Bhansali. This movie had been in the making for over a decade and hence had already created ample curiosity in the moviegoers minds. After watching the movie, I was at a loss of words. I don't even know where to begin! The music, screenplay, acting, dialogues and the beautiful story of 3 complex characters - everything is magnificent and spectacular! This movie is poetry in motion, easily one of the most epic tales in Indian history being translated in such a classy yet relatable manner on screen! Each scene and each dialogue gets the viewers completely hooked! People were involved and taken back into the 18th century - such was the appeal of the movie! The acting is PHENOMENAL! Ranveer Singh has always delivered fabulous performances, but this performance will be remembered until the end of his career as the performance that catapulted him into the hearts of the Indian cinema lovers. He has done a beyond brilliant job and as a viewer, we laugh, cry and root for him throughout the movie! He's the out and out star of the film. Priyanka Chopra is her usual magnificent self, nothing else can be expected of her after delivering award winning performances in Barfi and Mary Kom. She lights up the scenes she's in. It's amazing how she's good at dance, acting and emoting on screen! Her pain as Bajirao's first wife is captivating and makes the viewers feel for her! What else can be said about the ruling queen of Bollywood, Deepika Padukone, that hasn't already been written!! She is a spectacle all by herself! She makes us cry, laugh, weep, and look at her in awe! She's fabulous in the kathak number, ""mohe rang do laal"" and she shines in every scene of the film! Especially in the scene where she meets kashibai and in the scene where she is jailed! Her eyes are truly the window to Mastani's soul! She matches Ranveer''s energy and their chemistry is undoubtedly historic and classic! What fabulous acting! The supporting cast is a marvel in itself, Tanvi Azmi as Bajirao's mother is fantastic! Her acting abilities are par excellence, couldn't have imagined anyone else in that role! The music, costumes, scenery, sets and decor are exquisite! Nothing less can be expected from an SLB film! This movie is easily one of the top 5 cinema experiences in the past 10 years! It excels in both content and creativity! I will definitely be watching the movie again, it's simply addictive and outstanding and leaves a lasting impression on the viewers mind. A 10/10 experience! Loved it.",positive
A Hard Day,"When I saw the poster that presented one man helping a man hold a gun to his head in a ""go ahead and do it"" matter, I assumed I was getting more of an action movie. Instead, the movie was more of a suspense thriller, but I'm not complaining at all, the movie gave me just what I need.A police man involved in a hit and run has a hard day when he tries to cover it up especially after he discovers someone saw him do it.Well done film making from front to back. the movie is filled with plenty of conflict that makes for some good twist and turns. It's able to do the whole ""just when you think it's over..."" bit without it getting stale for the audience. You want to know what's going to happen at the very end, but I welcomed all the obstacles that came along, they really hold your interest.Especially the main antagonist who reminds me of Micheal Shannon's character in the movie Premium Rush, but a little more confident and darker. It was not the action movie that I though it was but it does not let down. Watching this will make your day.",negative
A Hard Day,"Director Kim Seong-hoon's sophomore film A Hard Day arrives 8 years after his directorial debut, How The Lack Of Love Affects Two Men was released back in 2006.Now, this film is a nerve racking roller-coaster ride, so the less you know going in the better. I shall attempt to introduce this film in one sentence: A comedy-action-thriller about the chaos that ensues after a detective is involved in a hit and run.The film smoothly and skillfully balances the dark comedy, action and thriller elements, giving us ingenious set pieces (a particularly memorable one involving a toy soldier...) and also well-paced and effective suspense. The film does not waste a shot, let alone a scene to make audiences laugh, squirm and be intrigued through it's twists and turns. It's tightly-wound from beginning to end and will surely be one of the best times you'll have in the cinema (or in your home) this year.Lee Seon-gyun (who you may recognize from Hong Sang-soo's films such as Nobody's Daughter Haewon) plays the lead role of detective Ko, a divorced father of a little girl who may not be the most ethical of cops. Lee carries the film, delivering a charismatic and humorous performance that makes us root for his character when he is faced with tough situations and pitted against Cho Jin-Woong's formidable protagonist. Kudos to Cho for interestingly pulling off a role that could have easily been bland. This film was also filmed beautifully. It's gorgeous to look at, thanks to cinematographer Kim Tae-Sung, who gives us dynamic and impressive shots (one that immediately comes to mind is an overhead shot during a chase).It's refreshing to see a South Korean film that's playful and never stops being fun, after the recent slew of superb but disturbing, dark thrillers such as I Saw The Devil, New World and The Man From Nowhere. Don't be fooled, this film has its dark moments. Most importantly, it holds one of the quintessential elements of movies: taking audiences on a ride that endlessly intrigues and keep them wanting more, having no clue where the next moment will take them.",positive

Newton,"Newton (2017):
Most of the people are unaware of a film named Newton until it was selected as an official entry to 90th Academy Awards from India.This low-profile film has attracted audience after its Oscar-entry buzz and even the reviews are highly positive.Starring Rajkumar Rao (2017's surprise star of Bollywood) and limited cast,Newton is directed by Amit Masurkar,who earlier directed Sulemani Keeda.SO how is Newton?Plot:Nutan Kumar alias Newton (Raj Kumar Rao),a government clerk on election duty in the conflict ridden jungle of Central India tries his best to conduct free and fair voting despite the apathy of security forces and the looming fear of guerrilla attacks by communist rebels.My Review:
Newton is one such message-oriented film which will equally impress both art and commercial audience alike.It is brilliantly funny poignant film which every Indian must watch.""Do you know what your problem is?"" a veteran election instructor asks a newbie.The youngster replies: ""My honesty?""""No,"" says the older gentleman, ""your problem is your pride in your honesty.""This conversation between Rajkumar Rao and Sanjay Mishra is one of the best scenes I have seen this year.In the same scene,Sanjay Mishra compares Newton's view is similar to Isaac Newton's view.Director masterfully wrote such strong scenes in the beginning of the movie which really created strong impact throughout the movie and even after coming out after watching it.Writer-director Amit Masurkar and Mayank Tewari have painfully captured the bittersweet essence of the people of an obscure jungle that's far-flung from civilization.Masurkar razes multiple Hindi film clichés to the ground in Newton by resorting to low-key black comedy to tell a tale of Adivasis being pulled in different directions by the police and Naxalites on election day, by making an Adivasi - that too a woman - one of the agents of change in the film, and by conceiving Newton as a man of indeterminate caste, even if clearly not an Adivasi himself.Newton is a dark comedy that gives you equal measures of dread and disillusionment and hope and hilarity. It makes you see the pitfalls of the democratic system but also tells you that it's the only one capable of positive change. This is reality at its finest, with credible performances and backdrops that immerse viewers into the world and where even the faces of the background characters leave a heartbreaking impression. The script is full of humorous touches and intricate visual details.Once again Rajkumar Rao proved that he is the upcoming gem of Bollywood.He gave a powerful innocent performance with perfection.Pankaj Tripathi is the show-stealer with his career best performance.Rest of the cast also impressed a lot with their natural acting skills.So,Newton is one of the best political satires I had seen from Indian Cinema.A Must Watch..My Rating 8/10",negative
Newton,"I saw this fabulous Indian film called ""Newton"" last night which by the way is the only Indian film to be screened at this year's New Zealand International Film Festival. This film was screened at Cannes and I guess this is the second festival after the Festival de Cannes where it is being showcased. In a nutshell, this film is about an election officer who takes the responsibility of going into a forest ridden with armed revolutionaries in order to collect votes from the local residents.I had read somewhere that Isaac Newton, the genius scientist, was actually a very complicated man. His namesake in this film seemed no different. While his intentions were good, his method of executing them was questionable. Which is why when you see this film, you will wonder if the protagonist is actually the antagonist. Everything in cinema is a matter of perspective. The film is infused with dark humour from start to finish and Rajkumar Rao is nothing short of a brilliant actor.Because this was a festival film, I saw this film with a primarily Kiwi audience which is always a great thing. I want Indian films to have a global audience. If main-stream Bollywood films don't attract a foreign fan-following, art-house festival circuit low-budget films certainly will. It is so ironic that I saw this film at a time when New Zealand is preparing for the upcoming elections This film appeared so minimalist yet was nothing short of a funny edge-of-the-seat thriller.",positive
The Fool,"If only the director was generous enough to give the end scene where the building slowly collapsed and zoom out, I will cry in happiness. Yet, the feeling for the existing ending is still full with emotion but more of a strong Schrodinger cats feel which secretly entails that Dima maybe wrong. I had to consolate myself that what Dima did was worth it and the ending made it very difficult for me.",negative
The Fool,"This movie could be a documentary on Russian society, it's hopes and fears, it's ideology, the eternal conflict between people and government officials, the dark and hopeless landscape of human minds where one can still choose to be human.As a Russian myself, having lived in my homeland for 34 years already, I can say that there's nothing that will tell you more about Russians than this movie. It is not a heroic WW2 nonsense, not a dumb czar era pictures, but modern life as it is. The things you will see in the film are definitely depressing and hopeless, showing the state of decay in society «God created this kind of life and he made us live it.».",positive
Dil Dhadakne Do,"Look of film is rich as their characters but they behave like a typical middle class family. I could have accepted it with few ones but every one!!!! Then what was the need to show them upper class!? Cruise thing was just stuffed to add some grandeur in film and it adds but nothing to add any entertainment or any good use of it in film plot except in boring way in climax. Writer and director had taken audiences for granted as if they belong to the family, whose story is being told. Lots of character confuse audience to understand the movie. There are very few emotional scenes and that too are mixed with some quirky humour so nothing comes to audience very clearly. There are few good emotional scenes, precisely shot actually, Neelam Mehara eating cake while crying, Anil Kapoor grabs Rahul Bose neck. Love track doesn't have any scene to mention. Its narrative style from the dog perspective doesn't appeal. Film bores and length makes it more boring. Performance wise Anil Kapoor and Shefali Shah as Neelam Mehra are very good. Rest are just OK. Music also bores as the lyrics.",negative
Dil Dhadakne Do,"The people who are saying this movie is not good clearly don't know anything about films.Dil Dhhadakne do is one of my favourite films.It is inspiring,beautiful,funny and just a full package.The film has a soul and is just a masterpiece from the director Zoya Akhtar.",positive
God's Not Dead 2,"(Spoiler alert) Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. and their commitment to non-violence are being discussed in a high school AP history class. A student Brooke asks if this is similar to the teachings of Jesus. The teacher Grace Wesley responds that it is and make some references to the bible.The movie's plot collapses right at the beginning. The bible references are enough to get her dragged to the principal's office where she is forced to either recant her statements or face the end of her teaching career - a highly, unlikely scenario to begin with. Grace was only answering a student's question. She wasn't leading her students in prayer and she wasn't preaching from the bible as though she were teaching Sunday school. The mere references to the bible, however, are too much for Brooke's freethinking parents and the ""evil ACLU."" Brooke's parents file a lawsuit against Grace.As the courtroom drama starts to unfold, we learn that ACLU lawyer Peter Kane's goal is to ""prove, once and for all, that God is dead."" In the jury selection process, ""Duck Dynasty"" fans are considered reliable to the defense, while ""Pretty Little Liars"" fans are considered helpful for the ACLU. Brooke's parents are never shown mourning the recent death of their son in a traffic accident, and are hoping that the winnings from the lawsuit will finance Brooke's going to college at Stanford. The movie overlooks the probability that a high school teacher is most likely not a person with deep pockets. As if making a mountain out of Grace's molehill response to Brooke's question wasn't bad enough, the movie goes off on tangents about the separation of religion from government and the historical existence of Jesus.I'm assuming the makers of the movie didn't hire a legal consultant to provide them with advice on the fine points of trial procedure. In the real world, an attorney cannot compel his own client to take the stand, and would definitely not treat her as a hostile witness. The ACLU attorney should have been raising objections to the defense bringing in Christian apologists to prove the existence of Jesus (or at least he should have brought in his own expert witness who could have shown there is no evidence to support the historical existence of Jesus). The whole court room scene would make any 1st-year law student laugh.There are a few subplots going on in the movie. The atheist-turned-Christian blogger Amy Ryan who found in ""God's Not Dead 1"" (GND 1) that she had advanced cancer learns that the cancer is in complete remission and believes that it was cured by prayer. The Chinese student Martin Yip, who became a Christian in GND 1, is disowned by his father who has arrived to take him home. Brooke discovers that her late brother was a Christian. Eventually, she becomes a Christian (what a shock). Like GND 1, the movie ends at the Newsboys' Christian rock concert.And just to add a little fuel to the conspiracy fire, a group of ministers are told by their senior pastor (Fred Dalton Thompson is his final film role) that their sermons for the past three months are being subpoenaed -- never mind the fact the such a subpoena, which screams First Amendment violations, is never likely to be issued in the first place. He never says who issued the subpoena. At the end of the movie after the credits, Pastor David Hill (another character from GND 1) is arrested for refusing to comply with the subpoena. In the real world, the ACLU would have helped the ministers defeat the subpoena.As in GND 1, non-Christians are held in low regard. They are portrayed as either shallow (Brooke's parents), rigid (Yip's father), or devious (ACLU lawyer Peter Kane).The cases listed, by the way, in the closing credits which claim that Christians are being persecuted for their beliefs have almost nothing to do with religion in public schools. Their focus is instead on requirements for birth control coverage under health insurance laws, and laws against discrimination based on sexual orientation.The message of the movie is that Christians are victims and are under attack from all sides by evil ""secular rationalist forces"" that control the government - even in Arkansas (the state's never mentioned by name but its flag and the state capitol building are shown on a few occasions). The movie is made by Christians for Christians who aren't going to ask hard questions about how it's so out of touch with reality.In the real world, some Christians (but not all) want to tear down the separation of religion from government so that they can use the government to spread their religion. Roy Moore, Pat Robertson, et, al, rail for mandatory prayer and mandatory bible studies in public schools. The non-Christians (Moslems, Jews, atheists, among others) that stand up against these high-and-mighty leaders are the ones who have been targets of hate and violence. They sometimes have had to classify themselves in lawsuits as John or Jane Does. They're not likely to have large crowds supporting them outside the court, like the crowds cheering the ACLU in this movie. Usually, they'll face angry crowds.In recent years, some Christians (but not all) have been portraying themselves as victims for not being able to discriminate against LGBT individuals.Note: As a historian, I would have responded to Brooke's questions by pointing out MLK's references to Jesus in his ""Letter from a Birmingham Jail"", which Grace's lawyer referenced in the court. I would have also mentioned that Gandhi said, ""I like your Christ. I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ."" (Christian Europeans, especially the British, in Gandhi's day treated non-Christians and non-whites like second-class people or worse, which hardly reflected a belief in ""love thy neighbor."")",negative
God's Not Dead 2,"A fascinating sci-fi alternate reality thriller with a fundamental reality twist that would put Hitchcock and the writers of the Twilight Zone to shame. Imagine a world where Christians were victims of oppression and persecution in the United States. As hard as it may have been to conceive of such an outlandish alternate reality (much less make a film about it), the team behind GND2 were Kubrickian in making this film. The idea itself is worth 10/10 stars on its own, all the way to its conclusion of an ordinary schoolteacher besting an Orwellian justice system. It puts everything in perspective, as the oppressors become oppresses (the shoe is on the other foot, so to speak). The film carefully parallels the persecution of non-Christians by seemingly earnest (but deceptive) believers, and completely switches it around! There were some faults, of course. Some of the legal jargon was misused (as it depicts a civil suit, yet the heroine is warned of criminal liability), and the presence of some expert opinions didn't really seem to be relevant to the case. Also, the dialogue did seem, well, unrealistic (but such is to be expected of Sci-Fi films). Overall, however, I felt transported to another dimension at the film's onset, one where Christianity was routinely shunned in the US. I felt as if I were really there. The one thing that stuck out, though was the audience: It didn't seem like a sci-fi prone audience, although the other viewers seemed even more convinced of this truth of this alternate universe than I was. I give it 8/10 stars.",positive
Frantz,"Diane and I viewed this brilliant film yesterday at Fremantle's art cinema and we both shared the absolute same high regard for the wonderful film that we had just seen. The film was so rich in cinematography, dialogue, acting and scripting that both of us were totally absorbed in this cinematic experience. I am old to the point where I have difficulty following subtitles: either they are too quick so that I can't read them before they disappear or they are too small and in the wrong print colour for this film they were perfect. The print was not too small, too fast or the wrong colour so for an old guy the visuals were perfection personified. As to the substance of the film's script, the action takes place two years after the end of WW I and involves two soldiers who met during the war and the family of one of these soldiers after the war. The drama is intense and its intricacies are sobering and manifest. A film to anticipate and make every effort to attend.",negative
Frantz,"The eponymous character is a cultured, pacifist, loving German young man whose doctor father urged him to fight for the fatherland. He gets the title because his spirit haunts the film — as the heroine Anna's lost love, as the Hofmeisters' lost son and as the kindred spirit his killer, the French solider Adrien, comes to love through his family and their memories. Himself another cultured, pacifist, loving young man, Adrien seeks out Frantz's grave and family to seek forgiveness for having killed him, albeit in the trenches. As he is so much like Frantz he wins over Anna and Frantz's parents and in turn becomes properly enamoured with her. Though Frantz and Adrien only met in that fatal trench, the narrative posits them as potentially dear friends, perhaps even lovers. That potential was dashed by the war.Adrien's relationship with Anna is based on his lie: that he was Frantz's dear friend, not his killer. When he tells Anna that truth she hides it from Frantz's parents, to spare them further pain and disillusionment. They cling to the illusion he will replace their son by marrying Anna and reviving Frantz' violin. To preserve their illusion Anna stays in Paris and reports living with Adrien. In a sane world Frantz and Adrien would have lived the lie to which Adrien retreated: they would have met in Paris and become fast friends. They might've competed for Anna on an equal footing. But not in this world. As Frantz's father reminds his war-mongering compatriots, fathers send their sons off to war. Though the nations blame each other, it's the fathers' responsibility when the lads are killed. The film's most obvious theme is how war needlessly fractures the brotherhood of man. After the war the Germans still hate the French, the victorious French the Germans. The hatred renews itself. Set in 1919, the entire drama of renewal and loss plays out under our knowledge that WW II lies ahead. The German discontent and French complacency will shortly reignite with even more catastrophic consequences. If Frantz shadows the scene from the past, the next war looms in the future.In addition to war, the film is about the equally difficult issues of how to live a full and honourable life. In peace as in war we're challenged to balance truthfulness with the empathetic lie. Thus Anna tells Adrien she has revealed his lie and guilt to the Hofmeisters. But she hasn't, preferring to save them the renewed pain and another disillusionment. To the end she sustains their illusion that she is living a full life in Paris with Adrien, not wasting away in grief for their Frantz. Where Adrien's lie served himself, hers serves them.The last scene promises a happy ending, her lie coming true, when she meets another version of Adrien, a fragile lookalike, in the Louvre. As young men on either side are interchangeable as cannon fodder in the war, young men can replace each other in civilian life when their mothers send them off to marriage. Tragically, Adrien doesn't resist his mother's assignment of Fanny, as Frantz couldn't resist his father's dispatch to war. But with the spirit of life a heart can survive death and loss. A new love can replace a lost. Until the next war, of course, which could well make her a widow, him a casualty.But that may be the film's most compelling theme: the importance of carrying on with hope and life. Hofmeister means master of hope. Through their mutual attraction Anna and Adrien snap each other out of their emotional paralysis, whether from guilt or grief. They bring each other to life. But as any war story inevitably requires compromise here they can't have each other. They have to settle for other mates. From Frantz letter on to the visits to the Louvre, the film returns to the Manet painting, The Suicide. A pallid thin man flings back across the bed dead, evoking both Frantz and Adrien — and Anna, who tried to drown herself after losing her illusion of Adrien too. In Manet's image off a despairing passionate death Anna finds encouragement to live.One of the film's strengths is its detailed realization of the period, not just in setting and costume but in conversation, tone, values and understanding. Especially in the black and white sequences, the film feels like a document of the 1920s, the period between the great, the terrible, wars. The periodic suffusions of colour serve two functions: they provide an emotional heightening to those particular scenes and they remind us that the film is as much about today as about its historical setting. Perhaps today the bloody fractures involve different nations, and different cultures at war within any of our present nations. But the dashing of hopes and fidelities continues.",positive
Spare Parts,"I found the rating of this movie to be over reaching. While the cast was an interesting blend, I just didn't feel much of the characters fit. Lopez didn't feel like he connected at all, and many of the scenes were very forced. I really appreciate that this is a true story, but I felt the acting (or maybe the directing) was just off point. the 5 stars are simply for the story told.I will say Esai Morales, José Julián, and Marisa Tomei did a pretty good job for their roles, they felt believable. I was surprised that Jamie Lee Curtis went for the role she did, while it was completely believable, there were some parts that had me going ""really? ...why would she do that?"" Carlos PenaVega was believable but the acting fell short in many cases, again forced emotions and sloppy writing for certain situations. Young actors are often caught posing and much like project almanac, often blank or shy smiling in moments that don't call for it.",negative

Four Hispanic-American high school students want to enter an underwater robotics competition which will pit their entry against some of the greatest tech minds in MIT, Cambridge, etc. Led by their reluctant, substitute teacher (George Lopez), they must use their fund-raising skills, minds, and teamwork to try to achieve an almost impossible goal.What a GREAT flick. Very highly recommended. I give it 10 stars on IMDb and five stars on Fandango. I laughed, I cried, I laughed until I cried, I was deeply touched.

Bareilly Ki Barfi,"For me, I was actually enjoying the movie. But not the ending...
I liked the main actor's character at first, looked and acted very decent until the character unravels. He is only decent around the girl but his heart is not. I do not think he deserve to be with the girl. I mean the last scene was so cringe when Chirag was happy and telling Pritam that Pritam taunted Chirag so much (basically like a week I bet!)...and they both laughed as it was so hilarious or something (and we forget that Chirag bullied Pritam for 5 years or so..lol)**they were not even friends, movie narrator even said 'mu bola dost'Chirag also said he learned his lessons (as being a selfless human) because he wants the girl (Bitti) to be happy. So, he would let her marry Pritam.
Well, same thing happened with his first love? He lets her marry off with another guy.. he was crying and all. So, what did he learn that time then?Also about Pritam's life. All the mental and physical abuse Chirag did. No one is going to talk about it? Felt so bad for the poor guy.**Lastly they become friends for real? sure :3(Just shared my personal opinion, I watched this movie lightly, sorry, that my comment isn't light enough)peace",negative
Bareilly Ki Barfi,"How often you watch a Movie which is so well and solidly written that the characters are tremendously real. The actors portraying those roles they appear utmost genuine and authentic to the audience. Well, Bareilly Ki Barfi is one such movie. Set in the small town of Barielly (Uttar Pradesh) we get introduced to the characters within five - ten minutes of the movie playing by the Voice - Over/Narrator (thanks to Javed Akhtar). We get introduced to Mishra Family, Father (Mr. Narottam Mishra) played superbly and excellent by Pankaj Mishra. Mom (played brilliantly by Seema Pahwa) and Bitti (played excellently by Kriti Sanon). They have a sweet shop just attached to their home which is run by Narottam Mishra. Seema Pahwa is a teacher in a primary school and Bitti Mishra works in Power Sub - Station like a Customer Care or Support Executive answering and attending phone calls. Hats off to Ashwini Iyer Tiwari for beautifully portraying the relationship between father and daughter (Pankaj Mishra and Kriti Sanon respectively). I mean how often in Bollywood Movies you see father borrowing a cigarette from his daughter, and on top of that he gives all that space and liberty to his daughter. Bitti's mother too remains suspicious and revolting for her daughter and her actions. Worried still that she may never get married after being rejected twice. Bitti later on finds support and solace in an nondescript and inconspicuous novel published by a Printing Press owner (Chirag Dubey played remarkably well by Ayushmaan Khurrana). The Novel's Title and Film's are Namesake. Bitti after reading the novel correlates with our own self like all the habits which she had bear a stark similarity with the female protagonist in the Novel. She gets smitten and falls in love with the Author of the Novel - Bareilly Ki Barfi. Here is the twist in the story. Even though Author of the Novel is none another than Chirag Dubey (Ayushmaan Khurrana) himself, who is heart - broken as his first love affair ended in a tragedy and was a disaster believes and fears that there will be backlash from women in the society and also his first love will be dishonored. Having said that, he asks his close friend Pritam Vidrohi (played ultimately well by Rajkummar Rao) to publish his name and photograph at the back of the Novel and credit him as the Author of the Novel. Pritam reluctantly agrees, but immediately after leaves Bareilly and settles in Lucknow by managing a job at a Saree Store. In the meanwhile Chirag falls in love with Bitti. On the other hand Bitti asks Chirag to fix up a meeting with Pritam and she desperately wants to meet him. In this era of Whatsapp, Facebook, Messenger who cares for hand written letters. They are a thing of bygone era. But wait, Writer and Director (Nitesh Tiwari and Ashwini Iyer Tiwari) bring this bygone thing and portray it to immaculate perfection onto the screen. Bareilly Ki Barfi is very simple and ordinary love story or I will say Love Triangle, but narrated, portrayed and enacted brilliantly and flawlessly. Also, take a look at the characters, they are so real and sincerely true in their emotions, behaviors, mannerisms. Right from the first frame to the moment when the end credits roll along, you as audience tend to flow with the narrative and in fact try to identify and associate with all of the characters. This is the power of script and screenplay and not to mention the direction. Must watch specially if you believe in good, clean and wholesome cinema.",positive
Indignation,"We watched this at home on DVD. We both enjoyed the movie.It is about a young Jewish student from Newark, NJ. It is 1951, in the shadow of the Korean War, and he goes off to college to a conservative school in Ohio. He is a serious student, very intelligent and very sure of his stance on assorted issues. Like religion, even though his upbringing is Jewish he considers himself an Atheist.INDIGNATION: anger or annoyance provoked by what is perceived as unfair treatment.And that is largely what the story is about. The student is Logan Lerman as Marcus. He wants to be left alone, his two roommates are annoying, and he also finds the Jewish fraternity guys annoying, he wants nothing to do with them. He wants to spend his time on study and work, he has no time for frivolous pursuits.For me the highlight of the whole movie is the scene in the office of the Dean of Men who called Marcus in for a chat after Marcus requested a different room. The thrust of the Dean's discussion is if young Marcus always flees disagreement instead of working things out, a skill needed in the real world. As the DVD extra points out, this scene runs rather long, about 13 pages of script, where the usual guidance limits a scene to about 3 pages of script. But the scene works wonderfully, we get to peek inside young Marcus and see what really makes him tick. Both actors, Lerman and Tracy Letts as Dean Caudwell, are remarkably good.The love interest is played by Sarah Gadon as very pretty student Olivia Hutton, who takes a liking to young Marcus and shows him some of the less obvious pleasures of boy-girl encounters. Overall a very fine movie with superb acting.SPOILERS: The movie actually opens and closes in the present time, an older Olivia is in a special care facility, as we saw in the 1950s she had some emotional issues and slit her wrists at least once. Back in 1950s young Marcus objected to the requirement that he accumulate at least 40 hours in Chapel, and eventually paid someone to go for him and fill out the card with Marcus' name. But they were both caught, Marcus was expelled, he entered the draft and was killed in Korea.",negative
Indignation,"Indignation simply means anger provoked by something perceived as unfair treatment and that's what happens to the main lead Marcus in this Phillip Roth beautiful adaptation. I would say there are three main reasons to watch this amazing movie.1. Thought Provoking themes and survival in a society where there exists no individuality - Stating it simply this film proves even its set in 1950s society don't follow good with change. Marcus played by Lerman considers himself to be an atheist and wants to stay that way. There are many things which he finds difficult to chose from like joining jew fraternity club, love life ,sexual awakening, relationship with his father , conversation with Dean of college.Unable to conform to these changes his life deteriorates and it's something that anyone who doesn't go all the way with beliefs of society and very well understand.All this is represented very beautiful manner. I don't want to say much about the themes as you should watch it yourself to draw meaning from them .I was wondering that the way in which the film started it must be going somewhere , it went and delivered more than I expected. The themes it tackles especially of individual freedom and independence is something even many people struggle in today's society. The was society wants you to make them their carbon copy only makes it harder. Apart from that the film also takes a genuine take on Human Character like Marcus Father worrying about him or How the slit wrist mark on Marcus love interest was not seen by him as he has no intention of that type but was quickly seen by his mother which at that moment hated her stating it's her weakness that will drown Marcus which I strongly object to. There are far more things and if you are an atheist it's of your interest.2. The Great Dialogues and Quotes - This film is filled with so much engaging and deeper meaning dialogues. Although I haven't read any work of Roth , I find these dialogues and quotes a rare offering from the Cinema. With all its deeper meanings and delights it hits you right and the heart and the brain. There is Great 10-15 minutes long conversation between Marcus and Dean and I really like it as I too doesn't have belief in God. The whole conversation was like a debate where everything had a counter answer and although for me Marcus won , whatever he said is embedded in my mind for its logic and clarity. For example when Marcus told Dean he is atheist ,Dean told Millions believe in god why?. Marcus said - Millions once believe Earth was flat. That's something and the film is filled with more of this.3. Performance In my opinion cast did a good job but especially this was best career performance by Logan Lerman of Percy Jackson fame . This surpasses his incredible performance of Perks of being a wallflower.This movie is a rare offering by Cinema directly reflecting on life and individuality even though set in 1950s , it highly corresponds to today's time too.",positive
Tom at the Farm,"I just watched this movie as part of the 56th Muestra International de Cine at the Cineteca Nacional, in Mexico City. As I noted in the synopsis, the director is also the protagonist, something that I don't consider sane for a movie. But the storyline seemed attractive. And my intuition was right: an excessive use of extreme close-ups, not helping to the narrative, but making it boring and exasperating. And yes, most of the close-ups, specially the long-lasting ones, were on the main character. I don't know the original text (I know it's a theatrical text), to make a difference between failures in the original story and the version of the director. The characters are interesting. They're strong. But I couldn't understand the basis of their actions. There is a scene when characters are doing this, and the next they're changing, and then they're going back, and then they make a new thing... The only well-presented character is a secondary one, appearing as much as 15 minutes. The actress in the role of the mother makes a very good work, but it's diluted by the failures in the story and the lack of strength in the work of the co-protagonists. At the end, I found the director being the protagonist, also made the selection of the music, the scenery, the dialogs (interestingly, the playwright helped with the dialogs). And it made sense with the result. A fragmented work, a complete lack of unity.",negative
Tom at the Farm,".... and I think Xavier Dolan threw in a subconscious symbolic message no one has picked up on.If you want to read about the plot of this movie there are plenty of reviews here that focus on that. I want to write something here that occurred to me maybe 3 or 4 days after viewing 'Tom at the Farm'.Near the end of the film after Tom has escaped from the farm and evaded the attempt by Francis to capture Tom in the woods, we see Francis walking away from the camera and on the back of his jacket is an American flag! That image left me a bit confused as to why a bold American flag. Then it occurred to me that maybe Dolan is making a statement that Francis represents what the USA is today - a neurotic phobic bully. And that is what we are given in the Francis character. The mother 'Agathe' represents the many citizens of the US that refuse to see or try to comprehend what is happening in their country. The unknown 'victim' of Francis represents the countries that have dared to 'talk-back' to what America does. And Tom, he represents the friendly nations to America and what Francis does to Tom is what the US has and is doing daily to it's friendly nations.I realize this may be reading more than really exist in this movie but ... this is the effect 'Tom at the Farm' had upon me.",positive
Rudderless,"Great original storyline that takes you on an emotional roller-coaster and leaves you thinking about it for days! I loved the music and that Billy Crudup and Anton Yelchin actually sing themselves...then there is their performances which was powerful. Not many movies impress me these days, which says a lot being that I watch more movies then anyone I know. This is a sad movie though that makes you think and adjust your perspective towards people. This movie might not be for everyone, but I don't think you can watch it without using the word WOW at least once. I ended up buying the album afterward. Great directorial debut from William H. Macy, look forward to what he does in the future.",negative
Rudderless,"Was fortunate to see this at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. The story line was very original and fresh. Emotional as hell! Really shows a story from a different perspective with a bit of a twist. NO SPOILER I PROMISE! Anton Yelchin was amazing. HE SANG!I was not familiar with him (I know, I know)and I thought he must be a professional singer who was acting. Billy Crudup was also a huge talent that I was also unfamiliar with. His voice was amazing but his acting was off the charts. You could really feel his emotion and understand his thoughts. The rest of the cast was also stellar. I am chomping at the bit for the soundtrack to come out. I will be the first in line. Thank you William H. Macy for an amazing piece of work!",positive
Dear White People,"I watched,with great pain,the pitifully biased and nonsensical film that attempted to elevate the discourse on real racism and its presence in our world. Well funded and full of passion,it simply shows whites as the worst people,ever. The black people in the film,ironically,came off just one half a notch less awful. Im a glass half full type,so I have more optimism than the cynic that penned this thing,but the answer to this problem is NOT to write a film that portrays whites as whiskey drinking KKK types with greasy hair and hate in their hearts. The only answer is truth. Pursue it. This is NOT the truth. Just a slant.",negative
Dear White People,Dear makers of this movie - little tip; if you want to attract an audience - try to come up with a title that doesn't alienate your watchers into eye rolling territory. It is a terrible strategy based on pseudo-moralistic far left ideas that are already unpalatable.,positive
Rememory,"Rememory - A sci-fi thriller with borrowed plot points and an unsatisfying conclusion. It's definitely worth the price of admission, however, being that it's free on Google Play before it comes out in theaters.The movie centers around an invention that allows people to view memories from any point in their life. It doesn't get bogged down in the science behind it, allowing the story to unfold. The problem is, it's not a very good story.Although the memories of these characters are on full display, I never felt like I got to know any of them. The main character, played by Peter Dinklage, is a figurine maker, but is seemingly Sherlock Holmes as well. I don't know how much PTO comes with a job like that, but he spends all his time investigating a murder on his own volition. It never feels like he's truly given a challenge at any point, and the movie is too busy trying to throw you off the scent that it doesn't seem to care.One thing that jumps out, however, is that the movie makes zero reference to the fact that Peter Dinklage is a little person. His stature is often the main focus of his character on Game of Thrones, but any actor could have gotten this role. Given what he lays out on screen here, the overall movie notwithstanding, it's clear why he earned the part.Another positive performance is offered by the late Anton Yelchin. He plays a troubled young man on the brink of total mental collapse. He put all he had into his small role, showing that his untimely death robbed us of decades of potential in the world of cinema.If you want to see a better execution of the technology featured in this movie, I would direct you to the BBC (now Netflix) anthology series, Black Mirror. Each episode is its own independent story, so you can jump in at any point. The one entitled 'The Entire History of You' delves deeper into the topic, and also happens to be my favorite of the entire series. Yes, Rememory is currently free, but you already have Netflix on every device you own. Queue it up. 5.25/10",negative
Rememory,"I am an easy sucker for any sort of film involving memories (Memento, Rashomon, etcetera) and this one had a plot synopsis that just begged me to take it in. It also made me think of the movie ""The Discovery"" about a scientist who supposedly finds proof of the afterlife, and while many people are committing suicide, he develops a machine that lets him apparently view a recently deceased person's memories.
I would have liked to see some manner of mystery or even a bit of incoherence done with the memories that are played back in this film. They all look too perfect; perfect vision, perfect audio, camera angles that would require the person to be behaving very oddly (such as an extreme closeup of someone's fingers playing the piano would've meant the viewer would've had their head resting on the piano). The intro video the scientist Gordon Dunn shows at a presentation looks absolutely nothing like recorded memories, and completely like something you'd see in a GoPro promo or some other HD digital camera technology.
The thing about memories, even fresh and recent ones (at least in my experience) is that they can often be an incoherent mess. Sometimes I won't remember large portions of conversations, but manage to somehow understand the conversation that was unfolding. I can ""feel"" certain attitudes and concepts and sensations rather than hear them. Sometimes the memories are completely wrong, as well; sometimes it's foggy and blue on a summer day, and sometimes just by the act of trying to remember something, I don't so much ""remember"" as create a fantastical re-construction of the memory.
Nothing of that sort is explored in this movie, and it's quite a shame, because the story that they did go for is very plain and straight-forward. The memories just become a sidepiece and a means of confirming people's stories in a murder investigation being conducted by one incredibly lucky and bold man.
Peter Dinklage is that man, playing Samuel Bloom, some guy whose brother dies in a car accident and who now he is obsessed with getting into contact with Gordon Dunn to use his machine so he can view his own memories, obsessed with remembering what his brother's last words were as he was dying.
In the process, he takes it upon himself to pretend to be various people, question people involved in Dunn's memory experimentation, use the machine to confirm their stories, and so on. He is perfectly at ease using a fake name and taking advantage of having watched people's memories before meeting them so as to better pass himself off as someone who may have worked for Dunn or with one of the subjects.
But this also makes for another thing that the movie just passes over, to its detriment. Peter Dinklage is a little person. There's no mistaking it when you see him. This never comes up in a derogatory or limiting way for him or his character; his character could just as easily be played by any other actor of any other size and nothing at all would change about the film or the character.
But while that's a good thing for him as an actor, it leads to some really odd moments in the movie, as well as a plothole or two, where Peter Dinklage's height would either be a liability for his character, or a benefit for certain characters who are trying to track him down. Knowing that he is a little person would make finding him significantly easier, especially when he thrusts himself into the middle of the murder investigation by stealing the memory recording machine.
It feels like the film was more focused on its plot, blissfully unaware of how predictable it was, rather than filling out the details that could have made the movie much more intriguing and fun to watch. The desire for Sam to revisit his brother's death just to remember his last words loses a significant amount of impact when those words are actually revealed, and it turns out you already figured it out right at the start of the movie when the death happened. It hardly feels fair to label it as a spoiler because of how predictable and ultimately insignificant it was. 
It also feels like the filmmaker at some point realized this was a very insipid line to follow, and rather than commit to it in some mildly nihilistic way, they tack on a pointless twist, one which not only plays little to no role in the ending, but one for which, due to them ignoring Peter Dinklage's height, becomes a rather significant plothole.
Overall, this was a movie that had a fun and novel concept to play with, toyed with us with the potential of this concept (the idea of a world in which anyone's memories could be viewed on the spot by others in perfect HD) and proceeded to do very very little with it, more focused on its boring and predictable story than with running wild with its imagination and doing something really memorable.",positive
Wakefield,"If you enjoy watching psychotic middle aged men completely abandon their families while completely isolating themselves from society then this movie is for you!! Two exciting hours of watching Bryan Cranston become increasingly more disgusting and manipulative with the bonus of seeing him defecate in a bucket. After you survive those two hours, you are rewarded with the most insulting ending you will ever see in a movie. Not only, will you never get that time back, you will waste more time being angry at that complete bs ending AND writing a review on IMDB because the ending was seriously THAT bad.",negative
Wakefield,"Let's start first with Bryan Cranston's performance. When watching this movie, I think it would be easy for someone to overlook just how good he is. 85% of the movie is Cranston sitting in a room talking to himself, and yet he is able to bring such dimension and drama to it. He makes it look so easy and natural, and that's why it would be easy to overlook his performance. He absolutely carries the film, and it does not work without his ability as an actor. Jennifer Garner is also really good in this movie, however she is absolutely outshined by how brilliant Cranston is. Her role was also minute enough that really anyone could have played her character, whereas I don't think just anyone could have played Howard Wakefield. What struck me most about Wakefield was how much of a character study it was. It was actually more of a situational study. What does an average human being reduce themselves to when stripped of all their possessions? When they become entirely deprogrammed from society? This idea has been explored before, in films like Cast Away, but never quite in this way...",positive

Script is well knitted & director has full control on the minutest details. 9. Each scene is well directed. 10. Akshay is redefining his own benchmark in each film. He has developed a perfect comic sense & timing to deliver dialogue. 11. Overall a genuine social cause has been presented in a perfect frame which penetrates deep into the hearts of each Indian, whether the person has a toilet in his home or not. 12. The best scene of Akshay in my opinion that moved the audience is, while the toilet he constructed for his wife, was ruthlessly broken by his own father. OVERALL TOILET is a perfect combination of social cause & entertainment. movie deserves TAX FREE in all over India. Akshay you are already an inspiration to millions in many aspects but after this movie, billions would love you.",positive
The Good Lie,Every RELEVANT character in this movie did a sensational job! the only down side was throwing Reese Witherspoon in this complex situation. The whole time I'm trying to enjoy the story and the struggle of these incredible characters and the only thing i saw out of Witherspoon is that she is completely out of her element and deep down she knows it. If this movie is to get any Oscar recognition...Reese will be it's only downside! That being said.... Learn some editing techniques and cut out all scenes with Witherspoon and it will still make sense and add more credibility to the film. Finally i need to decide who to blame...the writer (i doubt it) the directer (unlikely) the producers and studios??!! enough said.,negative

My country's people is not a drama fan... They probably squeezing each other at the comedy's and action's section.Oh right.... the film is a masterpiece. The storyline and scenery, the cast and everything about the film is just wonderful. It's like one of the most beautiful film I have ever seen since Blackswan. This film should win an Oscar just for its existing. The storyline was beautiful. And the fact that it is real made me cry even more. At the beginning of the film it was so so touching and sad, and then it made me laugh somewhere in the middle, and it ended with me crying like a baby alone in the theatre. Like literally. The cast performance is wonderful. They should probably need to win some awards or i'll hate everyone.The film ended, and I walk out alone from the entire theatre, with red eyes, tear all over my face and every single cinema's employees stare at me like what wrong with this guy LOL.

The Bélier Family,"Paula is an average country-girl who discovers that she has the gift of singing. Her music teacher even suggests that he coaches her for a big audition, the Maîtrise of Radio France in Paris. The only snag is: Paula's entire family (mother, father and brother) are deaf, and they need her as a translator to the ""hearing world"".This is actually a very conventional ""I have a dream""-type movie which centers around real-life French casting show participant Anne Peichert aka Louane Emera, who plays a simple schoolgirl (albeit one with golden tresses and the looks of model) who comes up in the world and emancipates herself from her parents, has to deal with puberty, finding a boyfriend, and getting along with classmates and pesky teachers.To add a bit of flair to the story, it is offset by the chaotic deaf family on the one hand, and the high-strung music teacher on the other. Karin Viard as the ditzy mother, Francois Damiens as the anarchist father and Eric Elmosino as the Michel-Sardou-worshipping music teacher are putting in extra shifts to save this movie from becoming a teenage shlockfest.As someone who deals with hearing children of deaf parents (they're called CODA - Children Of Deaf Adults) professionally, I have to say that it's highly unusual for deaf parents to be so dependent on a translator or facilitator. They can usually read lips just fine.But basically this is not a documentary but a movie squarely aimed at teenage girls.",negative

24,"'24' by Vikram K Kumar is essentially a family drama centered around the idea of time-travel. However, the film also includes elements of romance, action and thrills in ample measures, even though the bulk of the screen time is spent on emphasizing the significance of familial bonds (Appa-Amma-Thaatha-Maama-Maami and so on).The director, who recently made the Telugu drama 'Manam' still seems slightly hungover from it. He has proved that he loves playing with the concept of time (13B, Manam). But the surprise in the screenplay here comes in the form of sci-fi elements. Tamil cinema (and Suriya himself of course!) has been churning out many sci-fi thrillers in recent times (Enthiran, Dashavathaaram, 7aum Arivu, Maattraann, Anegan, Indru Netru Naalai to name a few). Some of these were characterized by an overdone formulaic story replete with masala, while a few of them stood out for their innovative screenplays and seamless blend of sci-fi with other genres.'24' marks a return to the sci-fi genre for Suriya. Hats off to the man for taking up this expensive and ambitious project after many a recent failure (Maasss, Anjaan, Maattraann, 7aum Arivu) and funding it himself. I will not shy away from saying that the production values look top-notch and the CGI is mostly sans notable flaws. The sets boast of decorative extravagance and are mostly a treat to the eyes, at times resembling the lavishness of Shankar films. The cinematography by Tirru is nothing short of spectacular in the initial portions. It would also warrant special mention that different color-tones are attributed to different characters with respect to their portrayal in the film. For instance, the intelligent, yet tender (and at times, clumsy) Dr. Sethuraman (Suriya) and his wife (played by Nithya Menen in an extended cameo) gleam in lighter shades (of golden yellow) while his evil brother Aathreya is burnished in darker shades (of brown).The story is really not that path-breaking to be honest but still holds narrative interest owing to the director's firm grip on attention levels of the audience, by way of utilizing its star lead's boyish charm during the romantic interludes, as well as a welcome change of seeing him play the character of a psychotic antagonist. Aathreya wants his brother's time-travelling device (which happens to be a watch) by hook or by crook and is even willing to murder his brother and his family for the same. Suriya depicts the antagonist Aathreya in a style of his own and the actor seemingly looks like he had fun doing so. The devilish grin and the plain stares are placed at apt junctures by the actor. Suriya, the romantic charmer that he is, uses his potential to the maximum in the scenes with Samantha, although, however cute they may look initially, start to wear out and eventually end up bland. The romance is underplayed in the first half, with Mani (son of Dr. Sethuraman, again played by Suriya) using his time-travel watch to woo Sathya through various instances of play-pause-repeat. ""I'm a watch mechanic madam, enakku ithellaam sarva sadhaaranamaana vishayam"" is a line that brings both laughs and shrugs. Some of the wooing methods deployed here are fun to watch though, and this makes the first half a mildly entertaining affair. The amazing opening segment as well as intriguing interval block are admittedly where the writer-director scores brownie points.The film slows down considerably in initial portion of the second half with family sentiments (even though Saranya Ponvannan is consistently marvellous at her job of exuding maternal warmth!) and downright- silly romance segments thrown in simply for the purpose of extending the run-time. Thankfully, it does not take too long for the sci-fi element to bounce back and take its rightful position in the film and the viewer is rewarded with a feel-good (rather feel- great!) climax. However, it needs be bluntly accepted before and after watching the film that a lot of it works purely on coincidences rather than logic or situational coherence.A R Rahman's music+BGM is certainly a plus-factor although personally, I am of the opinion that a sci-fi film would be much better off without so many song-n-dance routines. If you, as a viewer, are able to forego these minor masalaic tropes and are okay with a run-time of 160 mins (editing dept. could have done better!), then you are in for a decently satisfying sci-fi treat!",negative
24,"This being my first review on IMDb,I'd like to be impartial.Masterpiece.The film's carved so perfectly you'll be satisfied once you come out of the theater. First thing,the story,it'll be what you expect from a time-travel movie.It's not exaggeration when I compare this movie with ""Predestination"" and ""Triangle"".The Interval scene will keep you guessing and if you can guess it,you're wrong anyways. Second thing,Suriya's versatility.Suriya is a perfect cast because you love him and hate him at the same time because he is the protagonist as well as the antagonist. Third thing,background score.Well,what more can you expect from the legend himself. If you see someone giving a rating less than 9,suggest him to watch the movie again because he didn't get it the first time.Thank you for the classic,Vikram Kumar.",positive

Our Little Sister,"I must admit that I am a sucker for anything Asian, and given the chance to sit down and watch an Asian movie I will gladly do so. So it was that I was given the chance to watch the 2015 ""Umimachi Diary"" (aka ""Our Little Sister"") from director/writer Hirokazu Koreeda based on the Manga from writer Akimi Yoshida.Sadly this movie was unfathomably slow paced and had next to nothing to tell in terms of a properly entertaining and captivating storyline. Sure, the movie had great acting performances, but the plot and storyline was just so horribly slow paced and irrelevant that the actresses struggled a losing battle no matter how well they performed.I managed to endure 1 hour of the ordeal that is known as ""Umimachi Diary"" before I gave up out of sheer and utter boredom. I have no intention of returning to finish the rest of the movie, because there was nothing entertaining here, and just watching the female actresses trying to stay afloat in a sinking script hardly proves for proper entertainment.This drama might certainly have an audience out there somewhere, sadly I was not in the target audience. But then again, I can't claim to have been familiar with anything about the movie prior to stumbling upon it by sheer random luck.There are far better Japanese movies in the drama genre, so I am advising you to find something else if you are in for an evening of Japanese drama on the screen.",negative
Our Little Sister,"All the Hollywood directors producing one comic-book sequel after the other (and all other directors as well) should see this film, they should turn away in shame, and quit directing. Movie is largely seen as a medium to entertain, yet it could be so much more.Watching this movie, in every scene, it is incomprehensible for a western viewer how it is filmed: There are only daily life scenes, nothing dramatic, yet it is such a heart-warming experience, a simple joy of watching people living their lives.The story follows 3 very different grown-up sisters who live independently in a big house. The father has left them when they were little, and now they learn that they yet have another little sister. Soon their little dormitory has an additional guest. The main characters are the youngest sister who tries to adapt to her new life, and the oldest sister who is determined to live her life lead by strength and kindness.Critics have compared Kore-eda with Ozu, because of his calm observation of life. Still, Ozu's films contain great sadness, while Kore-eda's movies ('Like Father,Like Son', 'Kiseki') are full of hope and joy for living. They show simple people trying to find happiness in life. It has a Zen-like quality: one doesn't need big dramatic events to show love and kindness, if you are looking close enough you will find it in the most ordinary things in daily life.This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.",positive
Think Like a Man Too,"I never review movies, but this one was so bad that I'm writing this as soon as I got home. I didn't expect much, but I knew that there were some well known actors in this movie. I found that Kevin Hart's character was so obnoxious and that the only good part of the movie was the 30 seconds piece with Drake.I NOT recommend this to anyone--even if they're a Kevin Hart fan. If you like comedies like 22 jump street or the neighbors, you would be wasting your time by going to see this movie as it does NOT compare what so ever.I am so upset with what I saw and I regret seeing it.",negative
Think Like a Man Too,Review: I really liked this movie because it shows you that even though Las Vegas is extremely Gotti there is still romantic places you could consider for marriage. The couples including a former player and his current girlfriend who almost steal the show away from everyone else because of his reputation and she having to do damage control. A newly divorced man who thinks he is a player. This cast of characters is perfect to have been roaming around Las Vegas. The director and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. There are some really funny moments such as the guys going to the strip club for amateur night and the girls being the audience. The in jail moment feels as real as it gets based on the couples behaving poorly in the strip club. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.,positive
Suck Me Shakespeer,"Like so often I ask myself how a bad movie can reach a good voting here and a good movie a bad voting. Of course tastes are different but this is exaggerated. This movie doesn't only have a bad story line, it has even worse acting actors. 90% of acting is done by ppl shouting around angry in a childish fake annoying way and behaving like everyone is uebercool. Especially the mainactor is awful. I've seen for sure over 1000 movies in my lifetime and I can say this one is in the top 10 of the worst. I prefer a ueberlow-budged movie which for sure can reach a better quality than this one. I hope this junk wasn't translated in other languages since there are a lot of other German movies which deserve to be translated first.",negative

Bala,"I don't get why they couldn't hire someone with dark skin to play a dark-skinned person's role. It completely takes you out of the movie when Latina's skin colour is inconsistent through out the movie. I have hundreds more complaints about this movie but it is just annoying me to think about it. Don't see this extremely lame film.The Bala character is such a vain person that it is extremely difficult to connect with him at any level. The man only cares about his looks and nothing else. In fact the man has no identity in his film except his bald head. Every character in this movie is one dimensional and defined only by their looks or something that will serve a completely useless purpose in the movie. Bala is his bald head, Latika is her dark skin and Pari is Tik Tok.They want to tell you that looks are not important and yet they underestimate humanity. We are not in the age anymore where people look at bald people and find it funny. Nobody sees a person's wig come off and immediately starts guffawing. Nobody does that.Don't waste your time with this film.",negative

Open Grave,"Oh dear. What have we here? I'm sure like most people, you came to this movie via the pretty good looking trailer. That guy caught on the barbed wire fence, the video monitors of people in cages, that big pit full of bodies, man it looked like it was going to be fantastic. Sadly though, that's the ""grave"" error I made too. To find a horror movie with an actor who's just been in Elysium, and earlier in the brilliant District9, I thought I was onto a winner here, but the acting? It's absolutely atrocious. Fake accents, and dialogue straight out of Scooby Doo. Dreadful, simply dreadful. You can almost smell the cheese on it.The premise was quite good, and I won't spoil it for you in case you manage to get to the end. But the cast simply ruined it for me. And the storyline is pretty convoluted as well. From the offset when a group of strangers wake up in a room (where have we seen that a million times before?) not knowing how they got there or who they are, it descends into a mess of a film. Towards the end it picks up slightly, but by then you've basically just given up on it. Very disappointing, really disappointing, I had high hopes for this one and it threw me into an open grave.",negative
Open Grave,"I went into this movie mostly blind, having only read a short summary 30 minutes before seeing it. The summary does not do this film any justice. I expected a quick horror slasher, that I could enjoy for 90 minutes and immediately forget about. What I got was a brilliantly shot, beautifully scored, and engrossing mystery/horror thriller that I will never forget. It relieves me to know that there is still some creativity and originality in horror movies, especially in this day and age. While the ideas and concepts in Open Grave have been done to death, it brings new light to a certain horror genre we are all probably getting sick of and uses them perfectly. A few horror clichés are still there that I am frankly growing tired of, but not enough that it hurts the film.The cinematography was top notch for a horror film. The casting was also well done. Sharlto Copley does a fantastic job as the lead, even with his real South African accent trying ever so hard to bleed through his fake American one. Also anything with Thomas Kretschmann in it is always worth a watch. In conclusion, if you are at all a horror fan like me, you must give this film a go. I think you will enjoy it.",positive
The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Them,"I have just finished watching this movie, and prior to that, the first two that are basically identical, though one from his perspective and the other from her's. The problem I found is that even the first 2 movies (Titles ""The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Him (2013)"" and ""The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Her (2013)"" had too many scenes that aside from the odd word were identical. To then watch this movie, I could find nothing that I had not already seen in the previous 2 movies. In fact, I have to say that 2 of the 3 movies were superfluous with nothing snappy, or fresh...I felt like I watched a very long drawn out movie that only held my attention because of the hype I'd read by previous reviewers here (who should be banned for saying how artistically it was done. Copying something is not artistic. Basically one horrid and boring movie stamped into 3 movies, though from the producers perspective they got to use many of the same film parts, so the cost of production would have been low - 3 for the price of one. As for the acting - below par, even for Eleanor's father played by William Hurt - yes they were all supposedly dysfunctional with a fairly high lacking of communication skills on both sides of the families with each and every character, but they almost all acted as if they were in a severe state of depression - the sister (a blond Jess Weixler) who was supposed to be only 2 yrs younger than Eleanor (Jessica Chastain) (but looks at least 10) was the only one to have any life in her, though she is pretty much a side character so didn't and couldn't have lifted the movie. Yes I get it was supposed to be sad - dead child (which they never in all 3 movies went into detail so we never even found out how the child died at age 2 yrs I think he was - not a single flashback of the child only the 2 main characters)= marriage breakup = angst for everybody +++ (just like in real life for many, so really what was new about this movie, or rather what made it worth watching - I can say for myself it just wasn't worth watching, and that is rare for me to say.",negative

James McAvoy has no acting talent that I can see.Overall, this movie was a waste of film stock.",positive
The Past,"Since A SEPARATION (2011, 9/10) has been my runner-up film of 2001 hitherto, I couldn't be more expectant to Farhadi's follow-up THE PAST. Relocating the milieu to France and signing up more internationally bankable names (Bejo replaced Marion Cotillard due to schedule conflicting), Farhadi has formulated a more universally relevant story to buttress his filmmaking journey, thus it transpires to be an astute move and the film is dedicatedly intriguing and unwaveringly laying stress on the fatigued moral yardstick gauging by modern standards. Similar to A SEPARATION, this film is also triggered by a divorce, Ahmad (Mosaffa), an Iranian man, goes back to France after four year to accomplish the divorce procedure with his ex-wife Marie (Bejo), who is expecting to marry Samir (Rahim). During this period, Ahmad has to live under the same roof with Marie and Rahim, with two daughters Luci (Burlet) and Léa (Jestin) from Marie's first marriage, and Samir's son Fouad (Aguis). In order to suss out Luci's hostility towards the remarriage, a suicidal incident causes Samir's wife in a coma surfaces up and jeopardizes the lives of those who are involved.Barren with music (not until the end credits roll), Farhadi proves again he is a mastermind of singling out precise emotive nuances from domestic entanglements, minutely digs in the roots of the problems, teases out the best renditions from a first-rate cast and maximumly bypasses any sappy platitude which is concomitant with the drama set-up. DP Mahmoud Kalari examines the storyline with a steadier hand than in A SEPARATION, the transcendent ending shot single- handedly elevates the movie's soured stalemate to a plaintive eulogy to love's most instinct primitive force. The performance is the film's strongest suit, Bejo deservingly won Best Actress in Cannes this year and her restrained volatility is awards-worthy. Mosaffa (the husband of actress Leila Hatami and a booming director himself) mostly appears as audience's on-screen proxy, leads us to unearth ""what had happened"" scenario, a busybody and a wannabe-hero in the mess. But the most admirable player here is Rahim, who is utterly composed and sidelined in the first half of the movie, but he is seething with ire and guilt in himself, a scarred psyche beyond redemption. Burlet (resembles a young Cotillard) and Aguis are glittering discoveries from the movie, Ouazani is pitch perfect in a limited but key role which alters the perception of the entire myth. Farhadi leaves many loose ends here, there is little elaboration on Ahmed's past and his background, and the truth about the suicide will lie forever with the comatose woman, but it is a highly accomplished woe of tale, relatable high and low, a gratifying follow-up of A SEPARATION and a solid brick of Farhadi's wall of fame!",negative
The Past,"As an Iranian, I have respect for Farhadi and I expected a marvelous film, and it was! He once again proved that a film can be watchable even without visual arts, thrilling action scenes or sexual materials. The structure of the story is somewhat similar to A Separation: two parallel stories of two families. Several twists and surprises convince you to stick to your seat to the end. There's no excessive dialog. You have to listen carefully and memorize all the details. It has a very interesting ending; even when the cast was shown I was watching what would happen next(!) and the audience were leaving the cinema while talking about the open ending. I have planned to watch this masterpiece several times. I give it 10 stars because it deserves this.",positive
Kilo Two Bravo,"I was recommended this by a fellow ex-serviceman as I'm usually pretty weary of this stuff. It is a little bit slow to start. (But then life in the Army can be like that.) Then it go's wrong spectacularly quickly. (Life in the Army can definitely be like that.) If you haven't served in the British forces you might not get this film, at one point I was sat quietly crying when a guy spat out a one liner that had me in creases. I won't go in to the old ""them and us"" bit, comparing British soldiers to American soldiers, suffice to say that these guys are very understated hero's. No hullabaloo, no histrionics just guts and above all a camaraderie that cannot be replicated anywhere else. But don't take my word for it, judge for yourself. Please.",negative
Kilo Two Bravo,"I like war films. Not because I like war, but since it happens I'd like to know more about it. This film isn't like ""Platoon"", ""Hamburger Hill"", ""Saving Private Ryan"" or any other such ""Movies"". This film isn't like a movie at all. It is so real that it sucks you into every moment as though you were actually there. After the character development, I was literally on the edge of my seat, with my elbows on my knees with my hands holding my cheeks. I saw it at home, so thankfully I was able to pause it to make a cocktail; I needed one because it was that serious. Other war films I have seen and liked; they seem like popcorn fodder compared to this one. I was so engrossed in the progression and actually became angry at war itself like I have never felt before. I wasn't aware it was a true story until the end credits and I cried then. I was emotional throughout the film, not even knowing this. It was so real that I talked not only to myself, but to the characters I was watching.Thankfully, there were no ""shaky cameras"" like ""Inglorious Bastards"", making it easy to concentrate on what was really going on. What was going on was disturbing and humbling at the same time. Every scene and every incidence was relevant. I don't even call this film a ""movie"", because it is better than that. I have never given 10/10 to any film and rarely write reviews, but this one is deserving of a 15/10 if that were possible. If you have any reservations about watching this film, cast them aside and view it. Every aspect of what a perfect film would be about is included in this one. It's not a family film or for those who faint easily. It is gripping, extremely graphic, truthful and simply a masterpiece of cinema. It is deserving of the Academy Award for ""Best Picture"", ""Best Director"", ""Best Screenplay"", ""Best Actor"", Best Supporting Actor"", ""Best Cinematography"", ""Best Editing"", ""Best Makeup"", and of all the films I have ever seen, I put this one on the top of my list, and that isn't an easy feat. With my child love of the ""Wizard Of Oz"" and my insatiable lust for ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Wars"", this film has dethroned all of them. This is the best film I have ever seen in my life.",positive
When the Game Stands Tall,"As I watched this movie, I developed and steadily growing dislike for both the coach and the team. There is a scene late in the movie with a kid who had spent three years on the bench and had never played in a single game. Earlier scenes showed that the team won every game in previous seasons by six or more touchdowns, and that star players played both offense and defense. What kind of crappy coach and crappy team never puts the second string in, even when they are leading by 40 points? The muddled point of the movie seemed to be that winning wasn't the most important part of playing the game. For me, this scene blew that ideal out of the water. For this team and this coach, the point wasn't just winning, but winning by huge margins, to the detriment of the players who weren't superstars.",negative
When the Game Stands Tall,"Responding to the overtly religious criticism/ This movie was about a team that won 150 games in a row. It was based on real life coaching. (This was not a made up part of the story but intrinsic to the coach's point of view).To leave family/faith values out of the movie would have been like telling the story of a journey without any information about how the characters were able to get from point A to point B when no one else in history had ever done so.Nevertheless the movie wasn't just about the overall journey, but also included the individual stories of the coach and black and white students facing their own challenges.The many football scenes through-out the movie were great fun to watch!",positive
Haider,"Simply put: Do not see. Or see it. Or see it on TV later. This film is not worthy of such discussion.FOR THE PEOPLE FROM KASHMIR (1). For people from Kashmir, who are looking for some authenticity in the storyline; I am sorry to say that the situations are mostly contrived. The objective is to create pathos for the hero of the film. So, the army is shown as the aggressor in a vacuum and its actions as the instigators for the common man. Many times, the people who fund such propaganda/ political movies have their own agendas and it appears to be very much the case here. There are other objectives and those are from the political leanings of the well-known, separatist-sympathizing, script-writer Basharat Peer. (2). In reality, the anti-terrorist local force, Ikhwan was made more from the people who had been wronged by the terrorists and not from turncoat terrorists. The cause and motivation of these Ikhwanis is not explained as such. The horrors and miseries of the terrorists (many of them being non-Kashmiris from Pakistan and Afghanistan) upon the common man and women, which created Ikhwanis, are not shown. Ikhwanis are shown as mercenaries under the guidance of the Army but Ikhwanis were actually the ones who had earlier been wronged and tortured by monster terrorists and that was their motivation against them. In the film, this Ikhwan-Ul-Muslimeen is deliberately called the Ikhwan-Ul-Mukhbareen. The subtlety in changing the nomenclature should not be lost on you if you are from Kashmir. The History of Kashmir and the names of places in Kashmir are being rewritten with an agenda and the story of the Ikhwan-Ul-Muslimeen seems to have been rewritten with the same agenda. (3). For Kashmiri Hindus, half a million of whom were forced into mass exodus, there is barely any mention and no background is provided about them. The script writer/ movie maker sees that if it was done, you could not develop pathos for any terrorist and Haider eventually is just a terrorist. (4). In the future, if a writer were to actually weave all the subplots (Kashmiri Hindus, What the army was up against, Torture of Locals by the Terrorists, Reasons for the Ikhwan, Role of the rich and the famous and the well off from among the Kashmiri Muslims .) into the narrative, it will be a hell of a story. Haider is not.FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE BACKGROUND ON KASHMIR (I will stick to facts) (1). There were 2 rows occupied in the entire hall. 1 row was occupied by people of Kashmiri origin and their friends. (2). The people in the row behind the Kashmiris were fidgety after the first 20 minutes of the movie. They would walk out and walk back in. I am not sure how many stayed for the length of the movie. (3). The story is supposed to be adapted from Hamlet. During the portions of the movie that touch the Hamlet storyline, one could only hear guffaws and lack of inclination towards the film. (4). During what should have been the most touching scenes and songs, people kept casually leaving their seats to fetch popcorn, to ease their heads, to take a break (5). After the movie, during the follow-up dinner, I asked some of the non-Kashmiri friends what they thought of the movie. They are open-minded, liberals and what you will call very secular. They did not believe the storyline was as much about Kashmir as it was about Haider and his conflicting/ unclear emotions for his mother and her undeclared, under the covers relationship with his uncle. Unfortunately, this portion of the story and the inter-relationships of the people were not developed well because the script-writer/ filmmaker chose to cover the Kashmir issue way more than required. The movie therefore became a hotchpotch. Even without any background, the non-Kashmiri people in the audience did not believe that the story was anywhere close to the truth. It was just their feeling about the story, even if it had been fact. The problem was that the script-writer/ film-maker tried too hard to thrust their emotion on the audience and that fact had not been lost. Think of a salesman trying too hard to sell to you and your reaction! (6). Their rating for the movie ranged from 1.5 to 2. They said that if they did not know that it was based on Hamlet and if it was an original story, they may have rated it 2.5.CONCLUSION This movie is not a game-changer or a piece of history for anyone. You can safely watch it now, ignore it, watch it for free on TV later, save your time and do something better ..(1). It will not appeal to the young Muslims because they know that it is not the truth. They are up against an incredible amount of propaganda anyway and if they have to be affected, it will be due to that propaganda than due to this movie. (2). The Kashmiri Hindus will know that this is a lop-sided story. They should not worry that general people (other Indians, an international audience  ) will believe in this being a statement of truth. (3). The remaining audience finds the movie to be only moderately entertaining (for art, visuals, drama, suspense  ) but certainly not a reflection of truth.",negative
Haider,"HAIDER to me is an acronym that means the following:H. Haunting. Be it in its background score, music, lyrics, playback (especially Rekha Bharadwaj, Sukhwinder Singh, and Arijit Singh), cinematography, or backdrop of Kashmir in 1995, Haider is Haunting, and how! The film will stay with you long after you have left the theater.A. Astounding. Haider is an astoundingly adept adaptation of a classic written almost 415 years ago that can be enjoyed irrespective of your knowledge about the Shakespearean Tragedy - Hamlet. If you don't know Hamlet, great! You do? Even better! I. Incredible. Haider is incredible - in terms of its performances. Be it that of Shahid Kapoor (Haider/Hamlet) who performs a complex role with the kind of award worthy chutzpah that should silence all his detractors once and for all. Or for that matter the the triumvirate of Tabu (Halala/Gertrude) - ethereal, dauntless, and supreme, Kay Kay Menon (Khurram/Claudius) - terrific, resolute, and subtle or Irfan Khan (Rooh/The Ghost of Hamlet's father) - rudimentary and underplayed. Not to be forgotten is Shraddha Kapoor (Aarshi/Ophelia) who pitches in a performance that is 'picture'esque perfect and so full of finesse. And of course the two Salman Khan's who are fans of the superstar and who will surely gain some fans of their own post this film. In fact, every single member of the cast pitches in a perfect performance here, irrespective of the role and duration.D. Daring. Haider is daring in talking about issues that many wouldn't touch with a bargepole and for the way it has juxtaposed a Shakespearean tragedy with a human tragedy - Kashmir. The valley is a character here that finally finds a voice of its own. The interpretations of that voice are truly brilliant.E. Effective. Sometimes experimentation and reinterpretations fail. Not here. With layer upon layer waiting for the audience to be interpreted (for example the touch of Oedipal complex between a mother and son, the growing of guilt of a well meaning lover, the song of the gravediggers, the examples of 'Chutzpah' and its comparison with AFSPA etc). Haider is effective on multiple levels and truly faultless in its execution.R. Rooh (Spirit/Soul). This is a film with an indomitable spirit that filmmakers would die to include in their body of work, and which Vishal Bharadwaj effectively manages to in this lifetime. This film has that which many a masterpiece may sometimes lack - a soul. A terrific triumph encompassing its soulful music, soul stirring performances, and soul warming message.In short - watch Haider - in a theater. For Vishal Bharadwaj, the Director/Composer/Writer. For Shahid, the rising prince. For Tabu the eternal Queen. For Gulzar, the lyricist. For the cinematography by Pankaj Kapoor and the editing by Aarif Sheikh. And finally for Kashmir, the unforgettable voice of humanity.",positive
The Brand New Testament,"God, a self-hating alcoholic who treats His wife with contempt, spends his time programming new rules for existence to annoy, torture and frustrate His creation - humanity.While His son (J.C) attempted to change to his cruel reign he failed. It is now the turn of God's daughter Ea to end Humanity's suffering - which she does by informing the world of the exact amount of time they have left to live and then returning to Earth to find 6 more Apostles and to write an all new Testament.Sadly, however while the premise is full of promise, the cast generally good and the cinematography OK, it is just not that funny, clever or satisfying. The film has energy, ideas and a certain charm but just cannot make it work it ends up a bit of a mess to be honest.This film has three obvious problems; 1) Major identity problems: The film starts off in a Jean-Claude Jeunet style (think Amélie), but just not quite as clever, lacks pace and is frankly only mildly amusing.Sadly, the comedy becomes more infrequent and the tone switches to serious drama for certain elements, then back to comedy, some philosophical musing, a ton of sex but then decides to drown itself in the surreal. So surreal in fact that the film loses its audience (the Gorilla scenes) as the pacing gets worse and the script is thrown in the bin.The schizoid nature of the film ruins it - the strong narrative set up in the first 20-30 minutes of the film is thrown out of the window along with the humour.This film could have been a great comedy about God, existence etc, instead it just becomes an undefinable mess, not really funny, not really thought provoking and not really very entertaining.It ends bewilderingly with a scene that does not make any sense even within the loose rules for narrative that the film sets itself.2) A very hit and miss script: Simply put if you do not like surrealist humour then you will hate this film.Reflections about God, life, existence and death are treated super seriously or joked about - it has some funny observations but these are exhausted half way in and later jokes are not very amusing aside from maybe 1 or 2.The script is at times cringe-makingly preachy - full of pseudo intellectual/philosophical musings that go nowhere and sometimes feel like a first-year university student's drunken ramblings, for example the All New Testament scene on the beach makes light of the whole premise of the film as the Apostles laugh at their quotes - not really very funny.It then just becomes embarrassing (poor Deneuve and the Gorilla). The script just does not hit any nails on the head and in my opinion because the film does not know what it wants to be half of the time.3) An obviously limited budget: This is least of the films problems but the digital effects which are used sparingly throughout are at times awful (the starling scene for example) The end scene effects are even worse.Conclusion Overall a very disappointing, pseudo-philosophical mess of a film - not really thought-provoking or leaving the cinema-goer with any kind of message. It fails because it does have not enough budget for Jean Claude Jeunet style visuals, is not nearly as funny as say Monty's Pythons Meaning of Life or Life of Brian, nor is it surreal enough to be truly memorable.

The Brand New Testament,"This is a fantasy, black comedy. Jesus Christ's kid sister Ea is living with their dad, God, and their mum, Goddess, in a city apartment in Brussels in the present day. She is sick of God's cruel and violent ways and at age 10, puts an end to it by freezing his computer and fleeing the apartment into the city.Her last act before sabotaging her evil Dad is to text everyone with their date of death as her father, God, has fated it. This causes first a media storm, then great changes in the world and for individuals now certain of the imminence or otherwise of their mortality.It is a wild romp as young Ea sets out with a homeless man as a scribe to find another half dozen disciples to add to her big brother's twelve, and write The Brand New Testament based on details of ordinary people's lives.It is more whimsical and generous than blasphemous, but still, atheists will be as thrilled as believers will be enchanted, by the new apostles.The storytelling is exquisite; Amelie-esque might be the best description of the style. Elaborately constructed frames of short bursts of gorgeous, surreal elements pepper the action to ensure that this movie is a very rare delight.Gloriously inventive, coherent, hilarious, metaphysical, philosophical, big-hearted, and satisfying.

Max is a movie the whole family will love. The music, writing and the directing of this movie is also superb. This movie brought evokes emotion as you really care about the characters and this dog called Max. I liked the twist that happens, that I'm not going to spoil and there were a few times where I jumped in my seat and there were times I was on the edge of my seat rooting for the dog. If you haven't seen Max please go see it, you will not be dissappionted. In fact you will fall in love just as much as I did.",negative
Max,"Going into view the movie, I had low expectations. I thought it was just going to be another boring kiddie movie. Boy, was I wrong!! This movie is action packed and intense. It kept me on the very edge of my seat the whole duration. There is some serious suspense to say the least. Not only that, but it's a real tear jerker. Good luck getting through this movie without becoming teary eyed at least once. I ended up falling in love with the dog Max and admired his loyalty toward his family. It really portrays how dogs are wonderful creatures at heart and brilliant judges of character. It's funny how one dog can make such a great impact. If you love dogs, warmhearted family stories, and tales of heroism then don't miss out on this one!",positive
"Like Father, Like Son","What does it mean to be a parent? Are father/son relationships based on DNA or love? In exploring these issues Koreeda produces a sublime, indeed I would say a perfect, film - perfect in every aspect: narrative, characters, acting, filming, soundtrack. All this is achieved in a relatively low key way - no histrionics in terms of story, acting or film making, but this is not to say that the film is unemotional: quite the contrary. Some scenes are devastatingly powerful. The contrast between the two families is brilliantly drawn, and all the characters have depth. Koreeda gives us some wonderful shots - particularly the journeys between the two homes. The scene at the river, where the two families share a picnic at a pivotal moment, is truly great. Father and son sit on the stony shore as the man tries to explain why the boy must leave, while behind them in the river stands an enormous boulder, unmoving yet constantly washed and imperceptibly eroded by the flowing water. The image is obscure but powerful. In sum, it is impossible to overpraise Koreeda who wrote, directed and edited this film.",negative
"Like Father, Like Son","Two families learn the devastating news that their sons were swapped in the maternity hospital, and each has been raising the other's biological offspring for the last six years. In trying to solve this unholy mess, one father has to face his own vulnerabilities.Koreda has one again taken his scalpel to family life and crafted a masterpiece. Fukuyama as the driven, high-achieving Ryota is a revelation, an advocate of the tough love school of child-rearing, who never wastes an opportunity to tell his son he should be trying harder, succeeding more. One word - 'yappari' - reveals his disappointment and ultimate lack of humanity, and proves to be a pivotal statement in his journey to self-awareness.Two archetypal elements of on-form Koreeda make this move a masterclass in dramaturgy. One is the sparkling, naturalistic performances from the children. When Ryota tries to explain to his biological son that he now should be addressing him as 'father', the stubborn, implacable resistance of the young actor is deftly played. There is a similar moment when Ryota confronts his tormentor, only for her young son to appear and remind Ryota of the kind of son he should have been himself. The other element is judicious deployment of point-of-view. Four parents go through this traumatic experience, but while the gravity of the situation for the other three parents is never in doubt, the journey we experience is Ryota's. He learns not only to love, but to accept, and even, in one phone call to his stepmother, to repent. Rirî Furankî is exceptional as electrician handyman Yudai. At first he seems more concerned with financial gain than natural justice, but slowly proves himself to be the better father. The fact that he is never shown suffering over the loss of his own biological son, and yet seems imbued with the humanity Ryota lacks, is testament to Furanki's performance and Koreeada' scripting and helming. Machiko Ono and Yôko Maki as the two wives who support each other are equally impressive.The situation portrayed is every parent's nightmare, and the film succeeds in conveying that, while also mining a deep vein of humanity and compassion, and even managing a few comic flourishes. Superb.",positive
The East,"This stands out as one of the most cinematic independent films that i have seen, felt like a real film. Independent films almost always have a great story to tell, as it requires such dedication from the cast and crew to make; therefore wouldn't be made if it did not have something to say. But most independent films seemed to find it except able to feel like and independent film, not saying they suck, it just doesn't feel like you are actually watching a film, and is (rightfully so) normally excused by the audience at film festivals, and in the select theaters it plays at, this film was highly cinematic and overall just told and utterly amazing story. It's the kind of film that keeps you thinking for weeks about the ideas portrayed in the film; and actually makes you want to rethink how you live your own life. All in all a great film to watch, amazing values, a great way to learn about a new life style; and a picture that really just gets you thinking. I'd recommend it for anyone to view.",negative
The East,"Hey, wake up IMDb reviewers. Hiller Brood, the security firm that is half the focus of The East, is based on Booz Allen, the Chicago firm that is the largest private spy company in the world and that supplied Edward Snowden with his felicitous job at the NSA. Business Week's site has a good summary article on their business model.Also: every review I've read seems to think the female lead's terrorist love interest, played by Alexander Skarsgård, is the group's leader, despite the only slightly subtle dig at that expectation the movie provides, when the infiltrator calls him the leader and gets surprised looks, after which the Ellen Page character is shown to exercise the most influence. (Hey, they're anarchists, no leaders, duh!)Don't know why some reviewers think the movie doesn't take a stand on the issue at its core: the morality of retaliation against corporate wrongdoing. The terrorists (and infiltrator) are young, good-looking and thoroughly moral, while their corporate enemies are ugly, brutish and thoroughly unpleasant, tho they have, of course, the law, and all its apparatus, firmly on their side.",positive
Housebound,"I had high hopes for this horror/comedy movie based off the reviews I've read. Usually, I don't know many successful horror/comedy movies, but the one's that are good, are quite rare. The beginning of this movie was entertaining and funny, I thought the whole movie was going to be like this, but I was wrong. It never really ""took off"" for me. In the middle of the movie, only a few things that happened that was considered funny, and there were slight jump scares; besides that, it was pretty boring. It wasn't until near the end of the movie when the entertainment picked back up.I was watching this with my friends and family and none of them enjoyed it, some even fell asleep. Personally, this movie was just okay. I wish it was more funnier, but I found myself most of the time- just waiting for something to happen. Don't get me wrong, this movie wasn't bad, and I thought it had huge potential.Some people may enjoy it, but I found it pretty slow half way into the movie.",negative
Housebound,"After the endless, mind numbing, clichéd, regurgitated rubbish one has to sift through these days, just hoping to find something truly enjoyable and a bit original; stumbling across this great little gem returns my faith a bit. It's great to be reminded that fresh and inspired ways of telling a story ARE still out there! It may be harder to find them now, but when you do, it's like a breath of fresh air to a movie lover like myself.There are only two movies to have done this for me very recently, ""NO ONE LIVES"" and now, HOUSEBOUND. Although two very different movies, it's the fresh and entertaining take on the genre that really stands out. It proves once more that you don't need famous actors, big directors or massive budgets;just talented vision and good story telling.For what it was trying to achieve within the genre, HOUSEBOUND was a perfect film for me. I laughed, I cringed, I was intrigued,I cared about what happened to all the relevant characters and the production quality was good.

Akshay kumar has acted flawlessly and setting another milestone for himself by acting as a rigid man who does not give up his dream even after multiple failures and malign and turns from a ""Badman to padman"".Being a woman it was more easier to connect to each and every action of the protagonist such as testing the pad on his own(by pumping animal blood) was the most touching scene which made me cry while watching.It gives me goosebumps while I think about the real hero Mr Lakshmikant.A jumbo hats off to him from the core of my heart and mind. Rest all have also played their part very responsibly and successfully. 
This piece inspires to dream about every small and untouched but inevitable needs of life associated with human being(Irrespective of caste creed and gender).
I will not go very far to proof this as I always wanted to write a review on movies and this is the movie which forced me to write the review right after coming back from theatre.

Rangasthalam 1985,"I was awed while watching the movie, a Telugu movie in ages, made with pure heart and soul.
You don't see actors on screen, only the characters with full heart and soul. Each character was potrayed beautifully with 200% effort by all the actors. I had my expectations while looking at cast but wow ever actor did more than 200% justice to their characters, which can be directly attributed to director Sukumar's effort in direction department, raw and realistic art work, beautiful cinematography, each and every other department.I was waiting for Sukumar to show his potential on such realistic movie rather than trying to make an intelligent movies which has no heart and soul. We all know what he is capable of but I am finally glad that he decided to work on such a beautiful script like Rangasthalam rather than pointless intellectual movies which I didn't like personally (this is purely because of my affection towards Sukumar, wanting him to make exceptional movies only).Coming to performances, Ramcharan was a standout as Chittibabu, I felt the character deeply realistic like many people we see in villages, innocent, pure at heart and stubborn at the same time, this is an outstanding performance by Ram Charan, I can't say anything about awards/rewards, but he won my heart with this movie.If this movie doesn't win any major Indian awards this year, we can only pray the god to give working brains to the awards committees.This is one of a kind movie came in Telugu after a long time.

Black or White,Kevin Costner and cast were top notch. I had no idea what to expect going in but loved this movie from start to finish.

It was such a treat to see such a thought provoking movie with humor and great acting all while dealing with subject matter (race relations) in an honest and though provoking way.

The trouble they face when one incident throws there life in a downward spiral and how they overcome it is the basis of pink . With minimum spice and maximum focus on story this movie is successful in keeping the audience on there seats from the starting credits to the ending credits and top notch acting from all the cast members gives a great experience which makes you think something like this can even happen to any girl in today's society.Leave aside the critical mind and try to enjoy this movie and think what should we learn from it.

Pink,"When a girl says NO, (she could be anyone, your girl friend, your date, your wife or even a sex worker). it means a NO. This is exactly the point which PINK drives to the audience, all the while shaking up our conscience and questioning ourselves. Minal Arora (Taapsee Pannu) Falak Ali (Kriti Kulhari) and Andrea (Andrea Tariang) are three friends and room mates who choose to go to a rock concert and run into Rajveer Singh (Angad Bedi) and his friends. The girls are invited for dinner which they choose to accept and it is implied that Rajveer and his friends tried to act fresh with the girls and Minal in an act of self defense hits Rajveer with a bottle, making him almost lose an eye. Both the parties choose not to go to the law enforcement authorities and few days later, the girls are threatened by phone calls and their house owner is given threats to have the girls thrown out. Minal goes to the police and reports the incident which happened that night and an FIR is filed. But to her shock, she is arrested on the charges of prostitution and murder attempt.Steps in Deepak Sehgal (Amitabh Bachan) a once famous elderly lawyer who has quit practice mainly due to his bipolar disorder. Sehgal offers to defend the girls in a case which almost appears to be a lost cause as the girls are subjected to humiliation and are portrayed as criminals.Amitabh Bachan as Sehgal gives once again a magnificent performance, his gas mask, his blank stares in the courtroom all add up to his fantastic portrayal of the character. Taapsee Pannu gives the best performance of her career, her body language, her mumbling, frightened looks and especially the scene where Sehgal calls her to the stand, make it the most outstanding performance of the year. Kriti Kulhari need s a special mention, especially in the breakdown scene on the stand.Angad Bedi is good as well and actually makes us loath the character, especially in the final cross-examination scene which brings out the double standards the society is into.Screenplay by Ritesh Shah deserves applause and especially the dialogues when Sehgal lists out the safety standards for women/girls.Direction by Aniruddha Roy Chowdhary is classy and does not deviate from the plot with inane sub plots. Right from the word go, he ensures every scenes grips our conscience and tugs us into self- examination.I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to watch flashy item songs, or duets set in Switzerland or out of the world costumes. This movie is for patrons who are into serious cinema and can appreciate good performances.",positive
Mr. Turner,"Amazing Movie! My husband and I saw it yesterday and LOVED IT! I am an American who owns all of Mike Leigh's films. His films are one of a kind! They give you a glimpse into people's lives. Either an historical person or in most of his films he shows us regular everyday people. The cinematography is breathtaking. This movie made me feel as if I had traveled back in time and I actually felt like I was watching Turner go about his day to day life. It was fascinating to me and not just to see his life but to watch how people ate, dressed, partied, spoke and the interworking of their relationships . It also gave us a glimpse into different social classes at that period in time in England. When I came out of the movie I felt as if I had been there with the character at that time. It gave me so much more than any other movie experience has! BRAVO MIKE LEIGH!!!!!!!!",negative
Mr. Turner,"We always knew that ""Mr Turner"" would not be a conventional costume picture any more than it would be a conventional biopic. It is, after all, a Mike Leigh film and Mr Leigh doesn't do 'conventional'. Of course, he normally concerns himself with the vagaries of contemporary middle-class culture, poking fun at, and then finding the bleeding heart of, the little people who inhabit his very personal world. (Leigh is, perhaps, the only writer/director who can crack us up and break our hearts simultaneously).""Mr Turner"" isn't the first time he has looked to the past nor to real historical figures for his material. With ""Topsy-Turvy"" he created the world of Gilbert and Sullivan and 'The Mikado'. As musical biopics go it is, perhaps, unique. Now with ""Mr Turner"" he takes us deep into the life of William Turner, arguably the first great 'modern' painter and almost certainly the greatest of all English painters, and in doing so has created the least stuffy costume picture I have ever seen. Of the several masterpieces Leigh has given us ""Mr Turner"" may be the finest.It begins when Turner was already in middle-age and established as England's premier painter and it follows him until his death. It reveals him to be a man of many contradictions, sharing his later life mainly with two women, (he had long since disregarded his shrewish wife and grown-up daughters whose very existence he always denied). For sexual favours he turned to his housekeeper Hannah Danby while preferring the company of the widow Mrs Booth with whom he lodged part of the year in Margate, (Danby never knew of Booth's existence until just before Turner's death). He could be both cruel and kind in equal measure, both to his contemporaries and to those he professed to care about and he certainly had a temper.We don't learn a great deal about his technique as a painter though we do see him, briefly, at work, including a wonderful scene, one of several great set-pieces, where he adds a daub of paint to one of his canvases at the Royal Academy's Exhibition. It's not really that kind of film. Leigh is more interested in observing the man and getting inside his skull and in this he is greatly helped by Timothy Spall's magnificent performance as Turner, capturing the man mostly in a series of grunts. Spall's Turner doesn't go for deep, philosophical conversations on the nature of art. He seems happiest making small-talk with Mrs Booth and when, in another of the film's great set-pieces, the conversation veers into the critical appraisal of a fellow artist he is quick to debunk the pretentious John Ruskin who obviously likes the sound of his own lisping voice.Spall, of course, is just the lynch-pin of a terrific ensemble. No-one puts a foot wrong, (including Leigh regulars Ruth Sheen and Lesley Manville), but one must really single out Dorothy Atkinson as the unfortunate and much maligned Danby and Marion Bailey as Mrs Booth. Both women are superb, giving us characters that are much more than mere historical sketches. There is something deeply moving in their silent acceptance of Turner's foibles, (and while Leigh's dialogue is splendidly 'of the period', it's often in the silences that the film is most effective). Credit, too, to Dick Pope's superb cinematography which captures perfectly the paintings without seeming in any way slavish. Indeed, of all films made about artists this may be the finest. I don't doubt for a moment that it's a masterpiece.",positive
Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV,"The film is great, amazing graphics, amazing actor rendering, amazing everything except a decent story for anyone that is not going to play the FFXV game.I would really give it a 10 however they just left it open for the game (hence the video at the end of the credits), quite a few questions unanswered too (for example what were the demons, how were they summoned, where did they come from?). I had no idea what was happening half the time, why were they fighting, why were some characters so important. All I can say about this film is that it is a introduction to the FFXV game, if you don't own a PS4 or an Xbox One are a gamer or have no intention of purchasing FFXV then this will be just a mediocre very nice polished CGI.I have no intention in buying the game and I feel duped, like a marketing ploy. I won't be buying a console and the game just because of a movie.I think by making the movie an introduction to the game they are alienating anyone not playing the games (at least previous movies were stand alones). The only thing I can suggest is to start reading more on Wiki and once the game is out hunt around on Youtube to see all videos from the game to understand the story better. Obviously this is what I will be doing as they left me wanting more. I wish they would make a sequel once the game has been out to tie things together.By all means, watch it, it is well worth it for the animation, amazing, however bear in mind that it is just an introduction to the FFXV game. If you are someone that has played the previous FF installments, loves the FF universe, pre-ordered and is looking forward to the new FFXV game then this is exactly for you and I highly recommend it.

Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV,"I have seen several movies regarding or based on video game, yet none not even close of Kingslaive. I also saw the other two Final Fantasy movies and neither of them is even half good as this one. This isn't a masterpiece overall, has its own flawes, but nonetheless it's a great and solid movie, worth watching and rewatching.
The CGI is spectaculos, so realistic and well-made, carrying you truly into a story, a fantasy. We see new power additions to the word, the eye-catching warp magic forged by the blink dagger of the glaive which is a pretty cool thing to watch.
But above all are the character, many of them very interesting -I really wanted to know even more about each of them- and the story itself. Some said the plot is not coherent enough. I think those people did not paid enough atention, especially at the prologue. Kingsglaive is not just a story about battles and special effects, it's a story about duty, about courage, about sacrificies and responsabilities. You care for those characters and their fates. It tells a good and engaging story, something that movies nowadays completly lacking. It has soul and sentiment. It has a message.

Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom,"Mandela: Long Way To Freedom (English): The film which is releasing in India after 2 months (24 January 2014) of it's international release (a week before Nelson Mandela's death), is indeed a nice cinematic outing based on the Classic Hollywood narrative style. Despite the film losing it's track while focusing more on the life and times of Late Nelson Mandela, the film scores with it's screenplay (William Nicholson) based on the autobiography written by the legend himself, then comes the production designing work by Johnny Breedt, whose brilliantly portrays the Apartheid times on screen, the cinematography by Lol Crawly whose shots brilliantly bring out the best of the legend and his times and then the proper placement of music score as well as the archival footages within the film's coarse, the the performances by the lead. The best among them comes the performance by Idris Elba who greatly delivers a performance that's worth cherishing and successfully brings out the portrayal of Madiba well and then comes the narration by the director Justin Chadwick, who keeps you engaged and sympathize with the film's journey to freedom. Not to be missed! My rating would be: 4/5.﻿",negative
Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom,"This is a film that is difficult to judge simply in cinematic terms since the subject is such a titanic figure in recent history, many older viewers (such as me) will have lived through most of the events depicted, and Nelson Mandela himself - the prisoner who became a president - unknowingly heightened the interest around his life by dying just weeks before the film was released. Yet, allowing for all of this, by any standards ""Mandela"" is a success, telling a powerful story in a honest and immensely moving manner with some outstanding acting. If it is somewhat reverential, this was to be expected, given the subject and the timing.Unfashionably for recent bio-pics, ""Mandela"" chooses not to concentrate on a seminal incident in the subject's life but to paint on a huge canvas, covering many decades and lots of political events in a linear narrative that frequently deploys news clips from the time. It is based on Mandela's long 1995 biography of the same name which I bought on a visit to Robben Island and read with great admiration. British William Nicholson (""Gladiator"") has done a skillful job of turning such a huge story into a manageable script and British director Justin Chadwick (""The Other Boleyn Girl"") handles a complex of ingredients with genuine talent. It looks good with attention to period clothing and artifacts and use of actual sites and some breathtaking countryside (it was shot entirely on location in South Africa).Ultimately, however, the success of such an ambitious work rests especially on the lead actors and the casting here was inspired. Idris Elba as the eponymous hero gives a towering performance, while Naomie Harris is a revelation as the more complex and less sympathetic character of his second wife Winnie. It helps that both are not major stars - although that is now set to change - and notable that both are British actors who affect convincing accents.This is a balanced portrayal of multi-layered characters. Mandela is represented with great respect but he is not offered to us as a saint. He treats his first wife unkindly and his support for violence is not disguised. The film really impresses with its representation of Winnie, a woman who suffered so much, hated so much, and herself caused so much injustice. Mandela is now dead but his great project - the creation of a peaceful and prosperous multiracial nation - is still a work in progress.",positive
Night Train to Lisbon,"Don't be put off by critics who thought ""Night Train to Lisbon"" was old-fashioned, too talky and lacking in tension, because there is something unique about this movie; by the end, it's quite an experience.Raimund Gregorius, played by Jeremy Irons in his slightly detached manner, is a teacher in Switzerland. When he saves the life of a woman, she disappears leaving behind a small book written by a man named Amadeu do Prado, and a train ticket to Lisbon. Raimund becomes intrigued by the insightful writings of Amadeu, who has since died. Admittedly, all this setting up of the story is pretty contrived, but the important thing in the plot was to get Raimund on that journey to discover more about Amadeu.He meets many people who knew Amadeu including his sister played by Charlotte Rampling, always an intriguing screen presence, she still seems to get plenty of roles with absolutely no loss of mystique. As Raimund delves deeper and deeper into the story of Amadeu, and his relationship with revolutionaries during the Salazar regime in Portugal, he becomes aware that much is missing from his own life.Amadeu's story is told through extensive flashbacks, with younger actors playing the parts of the older storytellers - maybe it's this element that some thought outmoded. Flashback was a technique beloved of film noir where we even had flashbacks within flashbacks. The structure of ""Night Train to Lisbon"" is not unlike 1944's ""The Mask of Dimitrios"". Although the plots are different, that old film was also about someone who becomes intrigued by the life of another man, mainly through the memories of others. I'm sure there are plenty of other examples.It wasn't until near the end that I realised ""Night Train to Lisbon"" had similarities not so much to old movies, but to a much older story: Raimund is inspired by the wisdom and profound sayings of a man who seemed better than other men, who spoke out against evil, became a healer and saves the life of a man whom he had every right to think of as an enemy. Finally, Raimund's journey has become more of a pilgrimage, and through the inspiration of Amadeu, he develops a more positive outlook on life.Although not exactly blinded on the road to Damascus, Raimund does seem to have an epiphany on the train to Lisbon. I don't know if the author of the novel, Pascal Mercier, intended such a religious parallel, but the script would have been too heavy-handed for any of the characters to have made that connection; it has power if the audience finds it for themselves.If a movie doesn't grab me, I can forget nearly everything about it by the next day, however I must admit this one has stayed with me. It's a film that gets you thinking.",negative
Night Train to Lisbon,"Jeremy Irons has such a beautiful appearance and manner that it is difficult to imagine him as a boring high school teacher, but if you can make this leap then the rest follows.A mysterious sequence of events results in his finding himself on the train platform at Bern, looking for a young woman who will possibly be catching the night train to Lisbon. He fails to find her but impulsively boards the train himself, hoping to find, not this young woman but the author of a deeply poetic and philosophical book which she had in her possession.He arrives in Lisbon and begins to search for this author. He discovers that the author died at the time of the revolution which freed Portugal from Salazar's dictatorship. But he continues looking, for the people who knew him, the people who were close to him, the people who might be able to bring to life the man who wrote these penetrating observations about life and fortune and morality and fulfillment.Lisbon is beautiful. It is beautifully filmed, the streets, the houses, the interiors. The people our man meets are some of them closed and guarded, for they have been deeply wounded by their struggles in these turbulent times. But, because our man is obviously deeply concerned, their hearts are moved by the openness of his heart, and they seize the opportunity to tell the difficult truth to this truth-seeker and truth- respecter. They are people who have faced terrible dangers and taken risks that our man has only ever read about.There is a scene where the young author, still not much more than a schoolboy, reflects on the horror of everlasting life and the need for death to give meaning to any and every action.And the flashbacks show the passions, loves and jealousies of the little band of revolutionaries. But the direction is such that artistic truth is not for a moment lost; not for a moment is there either banality or melodrama.The mysterious young woman from Switzerland, who has started this whole chain of events, and whom we have forgotten about, eventually re- appears. And what a story she tells. I wept. I weep now when I remember it.",positive
Escobar: Paradise Lost,"Turning the live of Pablo Escobar – for most, the most ruthless drug-lord in history, for others, mainly his countrymen, a form of Robin Hood – into a motion picture, would conjure up images of a Columbian ""Scarface"". Unfortunately the director, obviously rather new to his trade, has chosen an entire different direction. The first half is more or less a variation of ""Last King of Scotland"". As in: naïve, western simpleton (Josh Hutcherson) becomes the boyfriend of Maria (Claudia Traisac), a niece of Pablo Escobar, and soon part of the family of one of the most dangerous drug-traffickers on the South-American continent (Benicio del Toro), and eventually has the ball turned on him. Realizing that he is merely an expendable pawn for the ruthless Escobar, the second part is a thrilling, albeit predictable chase-scene between the Hutcherson-character and Escobar's henchmen.Del Toro as villain is as competent as you'd expect from the actor, but unfortunately, the script doesn't give him much to work with. We learn preciously little about the figure Escobar. Was he simply a self-serving thug, who hid from the limelight under the disguise of a philanthropist? Or were there deeper shades of grey to the character? We'll never find out (at least not through this movie). Primarily, the film focuses on Hutcherson, whose character (or acting abilities) isn't all that interesting. Again, apart from the basic premise, the film has something else in common with above mentioned ""Last King of Scotland"": Hutcherson is likewise a fictional character (unlike McAvoy's doctor, that was essentially an amalgamation of various real people). Though some people, like myself, aren't always comfortable with mixing fact and fiction under the mantle of artistic freedom, it at least would have been an opportunity to take a close look at the fascinating figure of Escobar through an outside eye. But once the story is turned into a pure run-and-chase-film and Hutcherson takes centre-stage, making you forget about the titular character, that opportunity is completely wasted.Rumours have it that there is another Escobar-film planned, featuring Javier Bardem in the title-role will bring. Which reminds us: one of the more memorable supporting actors, playing the role of ruthless killer, is played by Bardems older brother Carlos. Once again proves that acting-skills sometimes runs in the family. The rest of the cast simply left me wondering why I should care very much about them in the first place. Same goes for the chemistry between Hutcherson and Traisac; though no doubt a beautiful actress, there is very little depth to their relationship, which makes it seem forced, merely there to drive the basic storyline.In the end, it just seems that director Andrea Di Stefano, though technically having done an alright job, bit off more than he could chew for his debut and it doesn't surprise that ""Escobar"" – at least at this point in time – has remained his only film. So, to see a grand epos on the life and times of Pablo Escobar, we'll probably have to wait a little longer (whereby I have not yet seen the TV-Series and cannot judge on that). I'm probably not the only viewer who sees the whole deal as a huge waste of opportunity, especially in light of having such a fine actor as Benicio del Toro in what could have been the role of a lifetime. A mediocre 5/10, sad to say.",negative
Escobar: Paradise Lost,"Entertaining! Paradise Lost tells the story of a foreigner who goes to Colombia with his brother to open a surfing school and ends up falling in love with the niece of the infamous Pablo Escobar, the drug warlord. As you can imagine, his life spirals into chaos as soon as he starts getting serious with that girl. While he seems to be in good terms with the mafia clan at the beginning, as soon as Escobar's life gets complicated and justice tries to trap him, the lives of those around him follow the same disastrous path.The tension of the movie comes from never knowing if the protagonist's love for his girl is going to be strong enough to put up with living with one of the most dangerous guys on earth at the time, or whether he is going to escape from the obviously choosing the wrong path. It's hard to tell if the movie is based on true events, (google can clarify that I'm sure) but either way, the film might easily have some resemblance with reality, since it is well known by everyone who Escobar was and how ruthless a man he came to be. I would honestly not hesitate to watch it as a good Sunday afternoon movie. But bear in mind, it's also the type of film that you will easily forget.",positive
Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru,"The thing good with the movie was the narration technique. It cuts back and forth between what happened 5 years ago and what is happening now in the story. Rahman gave us a nice performance. Almost all the actors were nice. The camera was nice. It used long shots wherever necessary.Now let me come to the problem.The third act is full of plot holes. 1. Why would Krish try to rape Shruti on the day when it is her birthday? There are all chances that at least two or three people would be there to celebrate the birthday. Why couldn't he go on some other day? It was because it was her birthday that Rajeev came and Krish had to lose his life. 2. Why does Krish ask Vaishnavi to lodge a complaint saying that Shruti is missing? Why couldn't he ask her to talk with his father in private about the whole matter? Why does she lie to Deepak that she came to the apartment at dawn?Besides, the scene which is shown like a prologue does not happen at all. That was a very cheap attempt to make us feel like it is a very big twist that we are watching in the third act. All in all, the third act spoils the whole movie.",negative
Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru,"It has all the ingredients of a perfect murder mysteries. Right from the keeping the viewers engaged through multiple perspectives of how the murder could have happened to increasing the pace and twists till the climax, it is screen play at its best.To choose new faces and to go without songs, i think the director deserves a special mention. This movie is an experience you will love. You will feel that you are a part of the investigation and that is where the director scores.You know a movie is brilliant if the entire audience applauds when the credits starts rolling. Kudos to the entire team to have scripted such a price of work. 10/10",positive
Bleach,"I'm a HUGE fan of the Bleach series, so I couldn't help but critique every little thing as I watched. There were a lot of things that this movie did very well: character and set design being the main selling points. Renji and Byakuya both look EXCELLENT, and Chad is just about perfect. It's a shame he didn't get the screen time he needed.And that's where most of my dissatisfaction comes in to play: time. There is so much character development lacking simply because there's not enough time in a single movie to develop everything the way it needs to. For crying out loud, Orihime comes across as a nobody with an unjustifiable crush.. Talk about disappointing.Ichigo himself is, overall, a success. They did a good job portraying his desire to protect people and his overall negative attitude. So in short, his personality was well-done! What I WANTED to see from him, though, was that overwhelming feeling of power. The anime does an excellent job demonstrating the weight of someone's reiatsu (aka spirit pressure), but that concept is practically nonexistent here. Which means all of the fights (though amazingly choreographed with some clever editing to try matching the speed of the anime) lack some of the awe and wonder that sets Shinigami apart from mortals.Oh, and minor spoiler alert for fans of the anime... the scene with the Menos Grande were cut entirely, as was Getsuga Tenshou. Let that sink in for a moment.So why watch this at all? Because most of the story is incredibly accurate - until you get to the last half hour. The fights are pretty epic. And altogether, you can visualize the anime quite clearly as you're watching, giving you a wonderful sense of nostalgia.",negative
Bleach,"Go see it. There is a reason people are raving about it as the first decently done adaptation of an anime. It's not perfect, but it is legitimately great and keeps the spirit and feel of the series. Most of the negative reviews of this I've seen so far seem to be coming from people who either don't know the series very well (a hazard with professional reviewers, since they cover so many things), don't understand Japanese cinema (some acting techniques/nuances are different between East and West), or who are just determined to hate it because everything doesn't look 100% identical to the manga (I've seen far worse anime to live-action with far bigger budgets, believe me). This movie condenses the entire half of the first season of the anime (books 1-6), and leaves room for a sequel without leaving hanging threads in the event one never happens.Like many other fans, I was very, VERY skeptical of this movie when it first was announced. I was honestly that person going, ""Oh god, another live action movie of an anime. Can't wait to see how cheesy and bad this ends up.""I'm a convert. You win, Mr. Sato. Take my left kidney and sell it, and whatever else you need to fund the next movie in your trilogy. I've seen it three times now (I live in Japan) and am going again tomorrow. I'm still not bored watching it. It's the sort of movie that fans of the series will keep finding new gems tucked away with each rewatch. If you're not intimately familiar with the manga or anime however, don't sweat it - this is very accessible to newcomers.Characters - 9/10 There are some physical differences (Urahara is older, Masaki's hair isn't red, etc.), but the acting is solid and the character dynamics/relationships are exactly the way they are in the manga. Even if the character looked a bit different, I believed the actors as the characters. Ichigo and Rukia may not have the exact same hair or face as you'd expect, but they absolutely nailed the characters - Ichigo's determination and grit, Rukia's spunky sarcasm, it's all really great.Costumes - 8/10 There was some saving of the budget here for fight scenes - you won't see exact replicas of captain's haoris or the tabi with straw sandals. Rather, the film tries to make things more realistic (i.e. a more natural orange for Ichigo's hair, smaller size hairpins for Orihime, etc.) It looks less like the wacky cosplay of the Rock Musical for Bleach and more like a legit world people actually live in.Music - 10/10 Invokes the anime without copying it, and Alexandros has two kickass songs that make Bleach feel fresh and edgy and hip with a touch of Japan's ancient history and the otherwordliness of the Soul Society.Plot - 9/10 Whenever possible, the film follows the manga almost exactly. For the purposes of sticking 6 manga volumes into one movie, some minor characters (Jinta, Mizuiro, Ururu, etc.) are not introduced, and some events get condensed (i.e. Uryu's hollow bait kicks off the Hexapodus fight that makes Ichigo take being a shinigami seriously, not a Menos Grande). Overall, the story is still very close to the way the manga told it, just condensed.Props - 8/10 Soul Pagers get replaced with something more like a glowing, teardrop shaped stone that looks more otherwordly (let's be honest, when Bleach debuted flip phones were cool, now they're a bit ancient), the zanpakuto are very accurate (yes, even Ichigo's, ignore the reviewers claiming he gets a different sword - the iconic one he's constantly shown with was not the first one he ended up with, and that first sword is what's used here). Rukia's glove and many other things are exactly like the manga.Set - 9/10 Rather than waste the tiny budget this film had in exactly reproducing floorplans and sets (a mere 3.5 million, which is nothing in terms of filmmaking on this level), things are made to feel similar. Ichigo's room is not laid out exactly the same as the manga/anime, but it still has a bed, desk, closet for Rukia to hide in, etc. and feels like Ichigo's room. Same with the Kurosaki household - it feels convincing, if not exactly the same as the manga showed it.Fights: 9.5/10 There are so many good moments here I can't list them all. Is there some visible wire-fu jumping at points? Yes. Does it ruin the action? No, it's no worse than some of the jumps Captain America made in a few films (you know, where they land far too lightly and stiffly to be actually ""falling/landing""?) The Hollows look less cartoonishly simple and more menacing, yet they still have the same mechanics (Cero, claws, medusa-like fur). At one point Ichigo's sword gets stuck in the ground and Renji RUNS UP THE BLADE EDGE and attacks. The swordplay is fantastic.Seriously, give it a chance. There is enough here to please all but the hardcore sticklers (who were never really going to like anything made on less than a Marvel Avengers budget). I was pleasantly surprised, and the movie feels enough like falling in love with the series all over again that I keep going back. I've never dropped $60 and counting on tickets for one movie, especially not an anime adaptation. GO SEE IT!",positive
Queen,"I had high expectation from the movie as it was rated 9 on IMDb. Everybody praising the movie and I disliked the movie. I watched the movie twice just to make sure that I am not missing something. The story was straight forward and little different from others. That was the only thing I found good about Queen. I find that like many other bollywood movies, the director doesn't believe in logic. All the technicalities have gone for a toss. It includes all known jokes. I really do not understand Why people have liked the movie. The movie tries to show empowerment of a girl and how do they show it by simply lowering the standard to start with. A Delhi girl who is scared to cross streets in Paris ( was she not crossing much crowded streets in Delhi? ) , Speaks continuously in Hindi. Rukhrsar(Roxette) comes to Amsterdam to study because they had no money(BOLLYWOOD LOGIC). Every scene follows some cliché. Gol gappe scene, the web cam scene, the sex toys shop scene etc were too predictable. For me there was nothing extra-ordinary in movie.",negative
Queen,"QUEEN is directed by Vikas Bahl, starring Kangana Ranaut, in the lead role, along with Rajkummar Rao and Lisa Haydon.The film revolves around Rani (Kangana Ranaut), an innocent Punjabi girl, who gets dumped one day before her wedding day. She gets an idea to go on her honeymoon all by herself, and that very trip shows her road to self-empowerment while going through several comical situations...The trailer of Queen didn't quite attract much attention, therefore, the film was extremely underrated by several critics, including me. However, the songs did grab a portion of my attention, so I was curious to know whether I was looking at Queen from a wrong angle. The film, itself, faced fierce competition from Madhuri-Juhi starrer, Gulaab Gang and the much-awaited Total Siyapaa. However, the reviews came in for the three films, and I was shocked to see so much praise for Queen. So I decided to go with the critics and chose Queen over Total Siyapaa that weekend. And I think its safe for me to say that it is one of the best decisions I've made in my life (and it might be yours too).Queen starts off in the most mainstream desi way possible. The Big Fat Indian Wedding with relatives at every nook and corner and dance to Punjabi tunes is galore. The calling off of the wedding takes place and you feel yourself going through the very same events as Rani. This is due to pure direction and acting. However, the film takes a VERY sharp turn when she leaves for her honeymoon. Rani meets new friends, goes through life how a woman should, and I think it was a smart move on the director to release it on Women's Day, because at the end of the film, the message is pretty clear. However, I shall not go on further about the plot, because after she leaves India, its all just fun.The acting is just top-notch. Kangana Ranaut, in all honesty, carries the film on her shoulders throughout the 2h30m run time. She portrays her character with such finesse that she deserves awards and utter praise for it. Rajkummar Rao played a great job as well and the rest of the foreign actors were just delightful and splendid to see.The songs are great as well. Amit Trivedi also deserves applause for the great music as well as background score. Every single song captures a theme of the film and just blends perfectly with the several scenes in the film. It helps you feel like Rani while she goes through her journey. 'London Thumakada' captures the Indian Wedding Theme, while 'O Gujariya' is just great to listen to. A special mention about the remake of 'Hungama Ho Gaya' which is just complete fun to listen to.In conclusion, QUEEN is possibly one of the best films of the year. I can't seem to see any flaw in the film; it is just complete fun. Go watch it; I highly recommend it.QUEEN- 10/10",positive
Embrace of the Serpent,"Interesting look at the lifestyle of the Amazon people in the vanishing jungle where a shaman deals with two diverse characters , being first Colombian film nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film .

As decades apart , an Amazonian shaman and last survivor of his people , and two scientists who work together over the course of 40 years to search the Amazon for a sacred healing flower . It's based on two true stories, linked together by one remarkable man and , perhaps, the most famous, celebrated river in the world, the Amazon . And the man is Karamakate, the last shaman of his jungle tribe . We first meet him in 1940 , deep into his sixties as played by Antonio Bolivar, when he encounters a man foreign to his home, an American scientist Richard Evans Schultes (Brionne Davis) . The rain forest of the Amazon are disappearing at the rate of 5000 acres day . Four million Indians once lives there , nowadays 120.000 remain .Embrace Of The Serpent is one such cinematic experience which brought a deserved Academy Award Nomination . Ecological thriller that has in highlighting the destruction of the South American rain woods by the rubbers ; being based upon a real story , on diaries by scientists Theodor Koch-Grunberg and Richard Evan Schultes , both of whom delve into the Amazonian rainforest in search of a rare plant with medicinal and hallucinatory qualities, with the assistance of a local shaman on opposite ends of his own life journey . An ecological adventure with mystical touches that was ahead of its time in denounce about forest destruction , including some disconcerting scenes , as the frames where a man is praised to be the Messiah is based on an actual event . Embrace of the Serpent attempts to frame the destruction of the rain forest's ecology and peoples as a slow-motion tragedy on scales both personal and cultural , but it is more intriguing in its ambitions, which frustrate it, than in it successes, which are limited . This exciting film contains thrills , emotion , adventure and marvelous scenes from deep rainy forest that generate a lot of surprises and illusion . This film has got some images ""stuck in their head"" including several sequences can stay in your brain for a long, long while . Glamorous and lush cinematography by David Gallego who photographs wonderfully the Amazon jungle , obviously filmed under difficult conditions on location . Shot in black-and-white, which is at once visually distinctive but also rather flattening . Evocative musical score by Nascuy Linares and the music Evan plays on the gramophone is Haydn's ""The Creation"". This engrossing and enjoyable film with interesting screenplay by Ciro Guerra and Jacques Toulemonde Vidal was well directed by Ciro Guerra . He's a good professional filmmaking giving various Colombian successes such as Los Viajes Del Viento (2009) and La Sombra Del Caminante (2004) .

Embrace of the Serpent,"......................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL It isn't much of a leap to venture that the vast majority of IMDb Users have never seen a Colombian Film. If there is a single word in the above Title that grabs you, rest assured, you must ""EMBRACE"" this Oscar-nominated gem by placing it at the top of your ""Must See"" List! Colombian Director Ciro Guerra (Los Viajes del Viento/read my Review) has taken an Amazonian Shaman's reality-based Dream and crafted it into a visionary cinematic hallucination for the ages! The operative term here is ""Culture-Clash"". Two delicately intertwined story lines, both inspired by travel journals authored three decades apart by two Amazonian explorers; German scientist Theodor Koch-Grunberg (Jan Bijvoet, ""Borgman""), in 1909, and by American amateur botanist Richard Evans Schultes (Brionne Davis, ""Avenged""), thirty years later. EMBRACE opens a gritty and convincingly realistic window into the Colombian Amazon Region of the early 20th Century. Guerra gets up close and personal with some of the persistent cultural atrocities perpetrated on indigenous peoples in the Amazon region of Colombia, without dwelling inordinately on them. As if the three plus centuries of Spanish Colonial Rule had not provided enough genocide and torture!For those of you addicted to ""Fast and Furious"" pacing in movies, undoubtedly, will find EMBRACE a bit ""Tedious and Slow"", but I would say, ""Deliberate and True to Life"". One can, at best, barely imagine the laid- back life rhythms in remote regions of the Amazon a century ago! The intentional ever-so-slightly grainy Black & White cinematography imbues EMBRACE with an authentic 1930's look and feel. Of course, there have been numerous critiques of thusly having deprived us of the myriad of Amazon shades of greenBut EMBRACE is not a Travel Promo and I applaud Ciro Guerra's Black & White decision! Here is a comment/comparison you probably might not see anywhere else: Although Director Ciro Guerra was born in 1981, I can't help but think that, as a kid, he saw and was influenced by Stanley Kubrick's 1968, ""2001"" (My Favorite Movie)! There were, in my opinion, a number of interesting parallels, confirmation of which I will leave up to you! Shaman Karamakate, the last survivor of his tribe (Nibio Torres-young/Antonio Bolivar-old) who has been chewed up and spit out as a lifelong victim of culture clash, and, as a result, defines himself as ""chullachaqui"", a walking empty shell zombie of a man.EMBRACE is light years from being a feel-good movie, yet, there is a ""spirituality and focus which can help you transcend even a worst- case scenario of mistreatment and misfortune in life"", that is transformational and which provides ground swelling inspiration! This unique film would probably appeal to those who crave unusual true stories, those of you who enjoy Drama focused on a Clash of Cultures, and movies set in exotic locations! 10*.....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!",positive
