MSG: The Messenger of God,"MSG: ------------------ If you're planning to boost your confidence, & trying to come out of depression then you must watch this movie --> MSG: Messenger Because after watching this there won't be any bad thing left to worry about in life(as this will be the worst of all of them).The 5% of the movie is about the Holyman: Sant Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh ji Insaan etc etc, his enemies & how they are trying to kill him in different ways.. rest of the movie is about what all the powers the baba has & what all the great stuffs he has done for the society. Some powers are mentioned as follows: >Generating electricity with a tip of index finger. >Converting firing bullets to flowers >Snatching Guns, melting in air, then making a crown out of it >Hypnotizing 500s of goons & making them followers instantly >Killing terrorists with playing mouth organ >Breaking an entire tree into pieces with a single punch >Punching 1 car and making fly 7 other cars >Producing water from drought land >Flying the bike, landing to the air balloon with a powerful bomb, making it blast, then jumping it back to the exact same position & many more... Some Actions baba is doing: >running blood donation camp >running free food for poor program >drug addicts rehabilitation centers >prostitutes rehabilitation centers >orphanage free homes >Clean India mission >Rock nights for youth & basically everything what Govt suppose to do...The movie is a long non-ending commercial of Dera Sachcha Sauda.. Where it is claimed that baba has total 5 crores of followers worldwide.Music: If you like the noise of running generator, then you'll definitely fall in love with all songs of this movie, which baba only has sang. The only difficulties is to understand the language in which all songs has been recorded, definitely not Hindi or English. The songs can start at any time, you can not even predict it. It comes liked unwanted mosquitoes who comes uninvited in your room, produce noise, bites you, then left you with their irritating marks all over.When you expect the great story has been ended, it start all over again with a new 'thrilling' baba's adventure. One thing is for sure, whatever you dress in life, whats so ever designer dress you buy for yourself, you can never ever ever ever ever beat the baba's style & fashion senses... he is just too good for any Earth resident.Overall its a movie you must watch before die, to set it as a benchmark for the hardest thing you've ever done in your life.So Go watch now.. before its too late.... because PART2 is coming soon.... [**i am going on a mental break for few weeks now***]",negative
MSG: The Messenger of God,"MSG-The Messenger emerged as a social reforming movie in the film industry. The movie has raised various issues of improving the society by tree plantation, cleanliness campaign and ban on drug. The movie is explanatory that how drug mafia targets a country. Each and every song of the movie is dedicated to love with God. The song 'desh k liye 'is fully energetic. The acting of Suspense and other action scenes is beautifully played by all the actors.the last dialogue of the movie leaves its great impact on the viewer and give the true message about humanity and human beings. The direction of all the real happenings in the form of story is beautifully shown. Thus the movie is not as one has thought like pravachans but all the humanitarian service activities are beautifully pearled in the garland of MSG",positive
Vivegam,"This is another typical one man taking on hundreds of goons kind of movie. Do not waste your time and money on this piece of waste. Kajal is just a side character with no real importance at all and is just a filler. expected much after the success of Vedalam, but this is a plain mockery ! watch at your own risk",negative
Vivegam,"The reason for saying it is a must watch is because, at least after seeing this movie, the impression on Indian Action movies among the audiences will change. This is one hell of an action ride.The movie revolves around a SPY agent 'AK' and his quest to stop the people who wants to create artificial earthquakes using Plutonium weapons.I like this movie not because the genre is new to Indian Cinema. It is because the way they executed it. Apart from some cliché heroism like evading hundreds of bullets, the movie is executed upon a beautiful emotional quotient.The stunt sequences are too brilliant and the way it was conceived by the writer and executed by him. Coming to the story part, the writer(and director) Siva has come up with the usual spy story. But instead of exploring the story, he made it a cat and mouse game kinda screenplay. It itches a little bit when we see something that could've been explored better was left to be a thin plot instead.Pros : 1. Jet Speed Screenplay, 2. Action Sequences,3. Ajith's Screen Presence4. Siva's Direction5. No smoking, drinking, glamour scenes or vulgar dialogues.6. Screenplay talking about self motivation and positivity.Cons :1. CG could've been better.2. Climax is tooooooo f*****g dramatic.3. Predictable interval twist.I came by some reviewers saying it is not logical in some scenes (like the dam scene). I would say, ""Folks! This is how spy movies are made. This is how action movies are made. Period!!!"" If you can accept people falling from planes with their cars, why would this disturb you? Just because it is an Indian movie?? or because it is not directed by Shankar or Rajamouli?? Change your view people. Take pride when it happens.Overall: This movie is a treat for Action Movie lovers. It is a WORTHY PopCorn Flick. Go for it!!!",positive
Boss,The usual story with usual action sequences. The major disappointment in this film was they show the hero of the movie Akshay 30 mins after the movie starts. A commercial films must show the main character first.,negative
Boss,"the movie has lots of action scene which are excellent only and acting by all characters are amazing specially ronit roy and akshay kumar.when you see ronit roy you actually found that you hate ronit in this movie great job by him.when you see the movie you see lots of turning point and corners which are amazing. the movie show the loves for father which is very good point. when you see the when you never think for story in your mind it did not give time for it as the right song comes at right time which makes the movie more enjoyable, its the best dramatic action movie of the year. when i comes out i m only saying that it is the paisa vasool movie because it is,so never think about the movie go and watch it you love the movie.",positive
Srimanthudu,"How in the world did this movie get 7.9 rating in IMDb? Makes one really wonder about the credibility of these ratings.Predictable from beginning till the end.Clichés after clichés following a pathetic story line.Basically the same old story of every other commercial Telugu movie, different plot and cast nothing else.Nothing new,Nothing to entertain nothing other than the same old, same old.The hero kills like 20 people and walks away in spite of one of the dead being an ex minister. Really tests the amount of bullshit one can handle.I guess the people who gave this movie a rating higher than 3 have a really high tolerance for bullshit or you get the drift. Speaking of acting the hero barely has any comprehensible emotion on his face,same bland macho expression all the time.And to think shruti hassan was nominated for best ""actress"" for this film,Actors by definition should act not only look good on screen.But i guess whoever nominated her for the award doesn't even understand.No wonder shitty movies like this gets 7.9 rating....",negative
Srimanthudu,"Director Koratala Siva comes out with an unique subject and presents truly more than what he wrote. His screenplay makes you sit for around 3 hours without complaining about a single scene. As they said in the interviews every scene is connected to another and you never feel that a particular scene is wasted. Mahesh Babu is outstanding as usual and nobody can do well than him if this kind of script comes to them. Mahesh is stylish as usual and looking more glamorous too. Definitely he is going to surprise the fans and others with his stunning performance, which is his best so far. Shruti Hassan does a key role in the film, not only as a lead lady, but also forms the limb for the power packed screenplay. Jagapathi Babu and Rajendra Prasad along with other huge star cast plays every character perfectly and one cannot imagine someone else playing those characters on screen. Not even a single character got wasted and not even a single frame went useless. DeviSriPrasad comes out with a energetic performance again as said by many. Background score and songs are as usual rocking and Madhie is the man to talk about. He is the one who presented the vision of director Siva in an extraordinary way. Editing, Choreography and all other departments are flawless.Simply - Mahesh did another film which nobody can do and Srimanthudu turns another blockbuster in his career and Srimanthudu is truly a classic in Telugu film industry. You cannot compare this kind of films with any other films and you cannot imagine these kind of films in the future. Lets hope for the best.",positive
The Human Race,"i'm honestly just writing this because of the high score and 2 rave reviews obviously written by people involved with the project. i feel like i was duped into watching it. so here's an honest review: this is a terrible movie. it's poorly written, and badly acted. only exception is the deaf girl. she wasn't bad, given the material she had to work with. it's just lazy filmmaking, seems like. says nothing about the human condition (as purported from the existing reviews), only the sophomoric insight of a film-school reject who saw one too many eli roth movies. seriously, avoid at all costs.",negative
The Human Race,"The first thing you need to know about this film is that it is low- budget, funded by a kickstarter project and it doesn't have a single person in it that is known in the movie world. That being said, this film is a brilliant indie that deserves to be in the spot-light. Smart, creative, well-made and seriously dark and disturbing, The Human Race restores my faith in filmmaking and the movie industry. Although this film is not for the film-goer who can only see films with bloated budgets and celebra-whores, the movie goers that do appreciate a film that takes risks and takes the honest yet disturbing route of displaying characters in ways that you're definitely not use to seeing, you will love and appreciate this film as much as I did. This film takes the classic Battle Royale storyline and pulls it deeper into the horror genre by showing a much darker side of the survival of the fittest as well as creating imagery that borders on comic book fantasy. Setting aside the awesome storyline and the genius way in which the film tells the tale, the director/writer respectfully showcases characters that are disabled yet are the strongest competitors and yet are also the weakest. I am in serious awe of this film and I hope others will enjoy it and see it for what it is as much as I do.Please like me on Facebook!

Kabali,"Let's be honest here, if this movie didn't have Rajinikanth, nobody would've given two f*cks about it because it's that awful and cringeworthy. It has to be one of the most lacklustre movies I've ever watched and comes as a huge disappointment after all the hype and media coverage it got. It's got an extremely banal plot of a Malaysian Tamil gangster Kabali, portrayed by Rajini, involved in a gang war with a local don. There's another storyline that runs parallel, that of his personal life which is even more insipid and overplayed. Radhika Apte as Kabali's wife has done a decent job but one cannot expect her to save a plot so weak that even the great superstar Rajini couldn't infuse life into. There's no humour, no punch lines, no message to take from the movie. In fact, the only time I laughed during the entire movie was when my friend walked into the door during the interval. The film went on in a monotonous manner until the end and the best moment was when the end credits rolled on, bringing an end to the viewer's suffering. Of course, a lot of Rajini fans loved the movie and said it was the best movie in the history of mankind but 5 minutes into the movie, any guy with a functional brain will know that it's all rubbish. Overall, I'd recommend not wasting your time on this lousy excuse of a movie made with the sole intention of cashing in on Rajini's reputation and raking up money.",negative
Kabali,"It is a very nice movie with limited songs and almost zero dance, Which is something special about this movie.Rajini lovers please watch the movie and please notice his dressing style. Its Awesome!!!Makeup Artist has done a great job.Dunno why people said its draggy, which I totally dint feel.Watch the movie and come to a conclusion, don't listen to what people say( Includes my opinion too).Please do not read reviews and go with the same expectation because people have different tastes.I personally liked every bit of it.Overall a nice move. Will not disappoint fans.",positive

Bharath Ane Nenu,"Koratala Siva has directed a film that appeals to both class and mass groups. Learning from his mistakes in his previous films, especially from his weak and unsettlingly quick climaxes, he has drastically improved. As for the performances, Mahesh Babu has delivered one of the best performances of his career. Not only him, but all supporting cast members have also delivered aptly.What to expect: Political Drama with Commercial Indian Cinema ElementsPros: Storyline, Production, Cinematography, Direction, Performances, Dialogues, Background ScoreCons: Some Lagging Moments (Necessary for Character Development; Excusable)Final Rating: 10/10",positive
Redirected,"This was one of the worst high rated movies I've ever seen. Made me so mad, I gave it rating 1, just because it was so overrated. I mean 8,7 from 12.000 users? Have you actually seen the movie before you rated it? I read somewhere this is the first Lithuanian movie to be accepted internationally. Well, if it means this is the first Lithuanian movie I've ever seen, then it's probably right. It's a Guy Ritchie meets Emir Kusturica. The acting is very thin, though. It's full of Eastern Europe clichés, but it's so overt, it's not even funny. I knew what to expect in each of the following dialogues 10 minutes into the movie. I fast forwarded through certain parts.In conclusion, if you want to see a bad ass, fast-cut, violent Brit movie, go see the Snatch. If you want to see an Eastern European movie, see the Underground. If you want to see a mix of the two, and a bad one if I might add, see this.",negative
Redirected,"I never thought that a movie with such a small budget could ever be made so well. And it's not some haunting house horror, but a full caliber of action, movie. I will not say, that it reached an A level quality, but comparing this one with other E. Velyvis previous works, ""Redirected"" is almost brilliant. The script on my opinion had few significant mistakes, but it did not stop me from enjoying the movie. Frankly, I couldn't stop crying while watching it, how funny that was from me. Though ""Redirected"" is orientated to the wider audience, I have to admit that there are some amazingly funny moments that will be understood only by a true Lithuanian (the scene with the emergency was crazy, but what is more crazy that it was actually based on a true story; or the old man in the forest making illegal hooch, witch is extremely popular in the country, I myself as a kid used to steal billets from there). The other east Europeans should also find something familiar.. :} but must not forget director uses lots of dark comedy. But overall I am pretty sure the West world will also enjoy the movie very much. They too will be able to recognize them self and how they look in the eyes of east ;] You know what, I can't wait to see it again.",positive
Waar,"I watched the movie with a great expectations after rave reviews and praise from friends! I heard a great things about its action sequences and storyline! But, watching movie resulted into sheer disappointment. Yes, this movie had great production value and great performances, the storyline is totally compromised and totally away from reality. The movie very well captures the emotions of common Pakistanis, but it totally misguides us. As always, the movie shows that India is behind all our problems and we are totally innocent. All the problems have been imported from outside. I believe that unless we will live in such ignorance and do not take full responsibility, we would not be able to address the actual problem our nation faces. Coming back to the movie, the performances, screenplay, camera-work and direction is one of the best I have seen in Lollywood for long time. But, the story is totally fictional and gives wrong message to nation.",negative
Waar,"Before i start,i want to clarify that I'm not a reviewer but merely a movie fanatic,so please excuse my poor language.Watch this movie for Spectacular edge-of-the-seat Action Sequences,A Strong Plot,Some Top-Notch Acting and the Best Music Score ever in a Pakistani movie,It totally delivers what was promised in the trailer.For a Pakistani movie,this is extremely good and an Average Pakistani will surely enjoy it.Great job by the whole team,especially Mr.Bilal Lashari,you sir have proved that Pakistan can come out of watching dumb downed action movies.I'm looking forward to your next project.Extremely well job for someone so young and talented.It was worth the wait.Detalied Review:-Visually Spectacular,eye candy scenes,Top-Notch Action Sequences and Cinematography.The Action Sequences are gripping and on par with level of Hollywood movies,and the Screenplay is handled perfectly,except for a few scenes,the movie doesn't lag throughout it's length,which I think is the best trait of an action thriller.Extremely well job by the whole Editing team for bringing us this great cinematic experience.-Direction is fresh and beautifully handled.Bilal Lashari delivered what he promised,and should be called a true perfectionist.His talent and enthusiasm reflects in each and every scene.The scene with the blend of Meesha and Shamoon's Waltz with Terrorist attack on police academy was an experiment done well.-Plot wise,the movie is a bit biased against India,but that's pretty much the truth we face today,it's RAW vs PAK throughout the movie,a few plot holes here and there but it won't disappoint.It is very solid and true to a great extent,shows us the facts that caused our current scenario.Thumbs up to Mr.Hassan Rana,who did a fine job.What i loved about it was that it doesn't offend the intelligence of the viewer.The whole movie was handled perfectly except the ending,which i think was was poorly executed and hurried.The melodrama should have been avoided.That's the reason I rate it 8/10-Acting wise,everyone did justice to their roles,particular mentions to Ayesha Khan and Hamza Abbasi for the brilliant chemistry,and Shaan was exceptional in his role of course,you give him a justified role,he can prove that he's so much more than an undead village superhero like his previous movies,with Khuda Ke Liye and Waar,he proves he is the best,and not in any way,less than any great actor you see in Bollywood or Hollywood.He is slowly evolving to perfection with each movie. thumbs up to Ali Azmat and Meesha Shafi who played their parts extremely well and made a great debut.Shamoon Abbasi fit perfectly in his role as a villain,he is evil and a perfect opposite match for Shaan.-Character Roles were a bit poorly developed and should have been given more thought.Dialogues were perfect,enjoyable and a wave of clapping pursued whenever Shaan came on-screen with his witty remarks.The Decision to shoot 90% of this movie in English can be justified,majority can understand the movie but i saw a guy sitting there who was being translated each and every scene in Urdu by his friend so he can understand what's happening,although Urdu Subtitles were available.-The Music Score of the movie is something worth particular mention,extremely great job by Amir Munawar and the whole team,the score is what that makes the scenes feel interesting and enthusiastic.The songs were emotional and energetic.On the whole,it was an enjoyable experience and we are proud to see Pakistanis coming forward and making great cinema.Don't miss it! It's a MUST-WATCH!",positive
Beta Test,"After seeing the rating for this on here (currently at 7.0, although I suspect that will change) I thought that this might actually be really good.But uhm, let's just say I think the director have a lot of good friends who are kind with their ratings.It's not completely awful, but it's not that great either.I've always liked Larenz Tate so it's cool to see him in something new, so there is always that, and he hasn't aged a day in 20 years (he's 41 believe it or not).He plays a gamer who's been given a beta version of the latest game bound to conquer global fandom, and the plot is decent enough but it's just such a low-budget film and that shows in every aspect of the movie.First of all the ""game"" that he's playing looks like it's well over 10 years old, and it simply doesn't make any sense why they couldn't just use real footage in the game scenes instead. Then at least Larenz would have a clear reason to be so blown away by the details in the game.And the ""twist"" about the game of course would have made A lot more sense too.Kevon Stover is one of the bad guys, and his attempts at being so stereotypically tough would make even Hulk Hogan cringe. I suppose that could be intentional to get a bit of 90's video-game feel to the character. But yeah, he's a chippendale appearantly which doesn't come as a surprise at all.The first hour is still semi-watchable if you manage to look past the flaws but the last 25 minutes is a bit of a drag to say the least.",negative
Beta Test,"It sounded good, it started OK and then it got awful.I watched it to the end which is the only reason it didn't get a 1 star but it is awful, awful acting, awful script, awful production values just awful.",positive
Knife,"I was encouraged to watch the movie and many friends recommended it on the lines that if you liked Ramana, you will like this movie. But for some reason, I found the script totally lacking common sense and showed the lack of depth in knowledge of the writers of the plot. The plot is centered around the struggles of villagers versus MNC(Corporate). The word MNC and corporate are overused in the movie, that it left such a bad taste to me. Maybe it would have been nice if someone explained Economics 101 to the writers of this movie. My distaste for the movie stems from the simplicity with which commercial Tamil movie makers want to handle the script - black versus white. Heroes versus villains. A lot of movies these days have transcended such stereotyping showing all possible greys, but this movie should have been made like 40 years ago, and then possibly it would have deserved all the praise. In fact a basic fact check would disprove the premise of the whole movie. Farmers earn more when they sell their land to acquiring corporates. It is simple market mechanism. If a beverage company dries out a river, it just means, we people are lazy and like to indulge in carbonated drinks. As long as there is demand, you cannot villify the firms for it. On a sidenote, both Pepsi and Coke follow sustainable practices for most part, and I would encourage the writers to check about it. And the farmers are none the poorer for selling their land to acquiring firms. See all the farmers driving BMWs in Gurgaon. And please for Godsake, companies do not collude as shown in the movie. If you want to switch off the real world and enjoy a masala cum emotional movie, then you will probably like this one. But please please do not come from the movie hall thinking the plot is real or even close to reality.",negative
Knife,"One of the best script and dialog's in recent Tamil movies. Vijay performed very well. Hats off to ARM sir and BGM is mass.Samantha is cute as usual.Neil Nitin Mukesh was perfect for his role.The message which was spoken in the movie is well conveyed and it will reach every corner of India. The dialog in the climax is class, Vijay delivered it in a very good manner. Dialogues in many scenes were too good.Only negative thing i feel that is the song placement.You can't compare Thuppakki with Kaththi, Thuppakki is an action thriller movie and Kaththi is an emotional social message movie. Overall the film is a blockbuster and a must watch movie.",positive
Go Goa Gone,"Go Goa Gone is truly one of the most hilarious Hindi films since Delhi Belly. It's a zombie comedy, with lots of blood and gore, so it's in no way for the squeamish, and the humor is quite mature, so it's NOT a child-friendly watch, but, hey, it's the subject matter itself which isn't really kid-suitable.Nevertheless, Go Goa Gone sets out to bring a new genre into Indian cinema with great gusto, and it fails to fail. With rib-tickling lines, great comic acting by Kunal Khemu, Vir Das, Anand Tiwari, and even Saif Ali Khan as the quirky, macho Boris (soon to be one of the greatest cult characters of all of Hindi cinema), Go Goa Gone FORCES you to laugh effortlessly.Yes, the plot gets a little dragging at the second half, and Puja Gupta's acting isn't very novel (although she looks great), but mostly, Go Goa Gone just always makes you laugh at one point or the other. I was chuckling at every other moment. The zombies are well-made, for a first in Bollywood, and nothing looks cheap. The action is pretty nice, and the songs are quirky and trippy.I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to have a good laugh-fest. Except the kids, of course...",negative
Go Goa Gone,"It's a rarity for Indian movies to step beyond the conventional(and convenient) love stories and venture into the unknown.'Go Goa Gone' tries that and does a commendable job.You have heard of romcoms,now there is a new genre and it's called 'ZomCom!'.The movie stars Saif Ali Khan,Kunal Khemu,Vir Das and many many zombies.There is good chemistry between the friendly trio of Luv,Hardik and Bunny.There's lot of slapstick humor,plenty of boisterous moments.The trio attend a rave party in Goa where all goes wrong.Thanks to a drug,suddenly zombies are spawning out of the blue and they are hungry for any human they can find.The trio find themselves stranded on an island with zombies all around and no way out.Enter Saif Ali Khan as a Russian mafia Boris.Off late Saif's acting has really transcended to a new level of confidence and this role is an example of that.His character is just so amazing.His dialog delivery with that Russian accent,his intimidating yet adorable looks,his intriguing persona-are all things you will love about him.You get a kick within when he says with that Russian accent- 'I kill dead people'.The rest of the cast has acted pretty good as well and i liked Kunal Khemu's(Hardik) performance.There are plenty of genuinely funny moments.Don't try applying your mind too much or connecting the dots,this one is just meant for fun.Watch it and enjoy!",positive
The Ghazi Attack,"As a veteran of the U.S Navy and the son-in-law of a retired LCDR in the Indian Navy, I was appalled by this movie.The technical aspects of submarine life as portrayed in this move are simply ludicrous. The list is endless, but here are four examples. 1) When a submarine employs active sonar (pinging), it immediately broadcasts its position to any and all who are listening. The proposition that an alert enemy would be unaware of the location of an active sonar source is absurd. 2) Torpedoes, even of that era, were not thunderous beasts, crashing through the water. They are streamlined, high-speed, killing machines that are as stealthy as the manufacturers can make them. 3) Seawater reaching the batteries, as shown in the move, would have released large amounts of poisonous chlorine gas and/or created an explosion sufficient to breech the hull and sink the boat. 4) During an active combat drill, members of the crew are shown at ease in the crew quarters. In a combat drill, every sailor has a combat station, and nobody would be idling about in their quarters.Even worse, is the unprofessional and incompetent behavior imputed to members of the INS. The assignment of a psychologically unstable officer to command a submarine is unthinkable. Verbally bullying his subordinates, brandishing a pistol, drinking alcohol with his subordinates while on duty (and he was a Sikh!) - these are not qualities associated with anyone who would even be considered for submarine command. To state otherwise maligns the integrity of the admirals who commanded the INS in general and the submarine forces in particular. Undoubtedly, there is a very interesting story to be told about the sinking of the Pakistani submarine, quite possibly involving bravery and heroism on the part of INS forces, but this movie is not that story. The lengthy disclaimer displayed on the screen and read aloud, in full, prior to the start of the movie, does not justify or excuse this collection of junk technology and transparent appeals to blind, unthinking patriotism.",negative
The Ghazi Attack,"First Indian movie that seems like Hollywood movie and this must be example to the change in Indian cinema.Excellent work done by debut director sankalp reddy, and proud that you are a telugu guy. you showed all the other directors in India, how a movie should be made.you can be role model to all the other debut directors.",positive
1 - Nenokkadine,I should say 1 nenokkadine is a kind of experiment in tollywood as we experience them very low especially from a star.The story is simple and the screenplay plays the magic role and it still needs to be tightened.The plot used to narrate it is quite unusual for telugu audience.Editing is average and music provides great strength.coming to performances mahesh babu who never fails as an actor is main strength of the movie.His look was a feast to his fans and his expressions in emotional scenes were top notch.kriti sanon played her part well.I should really appreciate director for choosing a different subject to provide audience a different experience in Hollywood style.But the main problem in the movie is it lacks sufficient suspense to hold the audience to their seat.The psychological problems of the main character creates problems for the common man to understand it.This movie is understood by each person in their own way.Some hate it to hell and some love to coreCinematography should be mentioned specially as it is heart of the movie.Stunts are good and twists make you stick to the story between some loose scenes.Overall it reaches high mark on Hollywood movie lovers and common telugu audience must see it in different way but not by routine telugu film formula,negative
1 - Nenokkadine,if you are a regular telugu movie fan....u will never develop yourself......It is a complete different movie and just rocking... mahesh performance was awesome and overall movie was a top class......those who want to watch a different telugu film apart from regular films....1- NENOKKADINE is the best choice i recommend.....Frankly speaking i enjoyed the film a lot .. Kriti sanon plays the role of journalist who was perfectly apt for the character The movie contains a lot of twists which makes the film more interesting.... Mahesh babu dances are the best so far.... songs are upto d mark....,positive
Theri,"The only appreciation I can provide for the Theri team is the dialogues between characters which is something different in a vijay movie which usually filled with 'punch' lines and other various 'hero' lines. This is where my 1 star comes from.Otherwise, this movie is utter rubbish. I have written the main events in this movie below. As you read, you can clearly see how stupid it is. The main character in this movie is a cop shown as both honest and intelligent in the earlier scenes. However, he quickly becomes brash and thick-headed. Hero kills a politician's son and boldy declares that he did it to the politician itself (how clever). As a result, politician attempts to kill him by sending mercenary, but hero beats them up and goes back to the politician asking him to stop. Enemy waits for the right moment and attacks. Hero loses his wife and mother while he barely escapes with his daughter and goes into hiding from his enemy. Expectedly, enemy finds out that he is alive and comes after him. The hero decides that enough is enough and goes after the enemy and destroy the enemy. I have lost hope in Tamil movies. It is rare to find movies with a good story nowadays. I am dumbfounded by the 7.5/10 rating this is movie.",negative
Theri,"For me, This is one of the Top 3 best Vijay movies ever. Perfect Mass Entertainer with a good message. It's all about how good parenting can destroy the evil in the society. Ilayathalapathy Vijay's & Samantha's Best Performance till date <3 The Outstanding feature was its Cinematography/Visuals by George Williams - Class :D GVP's Songs/Music/BGM - Awesome work and Goosebumps along with Vijay's Extraordinary screen Presence :) It has all the elements to satisfy the fans and the neutral audience. I didn't get bored even for a nano second and it was worth every penny you spend. The Technical side of the movie was astounding and ATLEE proved he is Shankar's best assistant director. The Three getups of Vijay was really cool.The movie ends like THERI 2 is on the way. All the credit goes to the Director - Atlee, He waited 2 years for this film and he is one of the youngest director in India to work with a superstar in the second movie itself and to gross 100 crores which will happen very very soon. He has told before itself the story will be very simple with a fantastic racy screenplay, credits to Editor Anthony L Ruben for that. Overall it will be very satisfying for all the audience and won't disappoint anyone. SUPERB ENTERTAINER. One of the best Action/Thrillers in recent times. Totally Loved it <3 Rating - 4/5",positive
Ali Baba ve 7 Cüceler,"Before I start of how i think about the picture, I would like to emphasize that I am a big fan of Mr. Yilmaz's stand-up comedies as many millions of people in Turkey. However if one must talk about the movies Yilmaz personally wrote and directed, then we come up with a conclusion that he is not as successful as he is as a comedian on the stage. The term of being successful is also too generous for someone to mention that kind of works. What are the requirements for a work to be called as a movie? That must be the first question for a person whose claim is to write the screenplay and direct a picture. And these requirements are not that simply to obtain as we can already observe form Cem Yilmaz's works. He has a great potential but have not gone many step forward since he started filming career. In every work he plays, his character acts identical with the character from the previous work. It is much the same person although their names differ from each other. The main and the biggest problem lies on the screenplay and directing. That are point where Mr. Yilmaz should be criticized. When we watch him as an actor in movies which he only acts and got no effects on directing and screenplay he is much more better. What he should be doing for his next work and what he is gonna make will be so different i am one hundred percent sure of that. Because he is not such kind of a person who evaluates the commentaries in a positive way.",negative
Ali Baba ve 7 Cüceler,"I didn't have the opportunity to watch the movie yet. But who cares, it is a Cem Yilmaz movie so it doesn't have any other chance than being a great work. I'll come and edit/rewrite my comment here after watching the movie. And if you ask why i am writing this, the answer is that i want to show you guys, to rate and review a movie you don't have to watch it. Knowing about the previous works of the writer/producer/starring actor would give you enough information about a movie. Here it takes us to the question what is watching a movie is? Is it seeing the every little detail in the movie and watching each frames the movie has? I watched the poster for 114 minutes and i consider myself as i watched it. Yes maybe I'm giving an extreme example but that is only because i want to take your time and stop you and make you think on the definition of ""watching a movie"". What makes a movie, a movie is everything about that movie. From the poster to the advertisement, every material and literature about that movie. So here i am reviewing it according to all other things except from the movie itself.Note:For those who are going to read this review and decide to post it or not, do not be deal breakers and let people read this review and smile. Do something nice, once in your live and post this!SINCERELY!",positive
Itirazim Var,"In the end, one of the guys implies that he was raped as a child.This is why he is gay, he had no other choice! This is the stupidest and most ignorant thing I've heard in ages. Onur Unlu, are you on your mind?Gaps in the plot.Not convincing enough but comic book aesthetics.Brave because lots of reference to the current Muslim government.Serkan Keskin is awesome though. Epic performance. Charming guy. And one of the lucky actors as cameras are in love with him.Onur Unlu is the director of Leyla ve Mecnun, phenomenal surreal comedy series lucky to be financed by the state television for years. But still, he needs a good sex education, I guess.",negative
Itirazim Var,"Seen at the Warsaw IFF 2014.Selman is an imam, conducting prayers in a small mosque in the city. He lives a rather peaceful life, playing chess via text messages and practicing baglama (a Turkish stringed instrument). Until one day two shots are fired inside the mosque and one of the praying men collapses to the floor. All hell breaks loose and - to make things worse - his dear daughter introduces her husband-to-be...The film is not flawless. Perhaps there's a bit too much a bit silly music in it (NOT the songs - those are brilliant), maybe the climax scene is a little too long. But believe me, those are minor flaws; what you remember when leaving the cinema is a delightful mixture of a classic whodunnit, a funny (sometimes very funny) comedy and a modern look on Muslim religion illustrated by very well thought over photography (the Turks have been getting us used to it lately) and flawlessly performed (see the last comment). It's a thrill ride also, the plot thickens, new threads develop and - yes, you guessed it - nearly everybody around could benefit or at least wish the victim death.Go see it and have fun.",positive
I,"I, directed and written by Shankar whom claims that he has delivered/conveyed a ""Masterpiece"" which was starred by Vikram, Amy Jackson in lead roles in ""I"". The soundtrack and the BGM were composed by the two-times academy award winner A.R.Rahman who has done a prodigious job.Now, let us bounce to the plot and the direction. The plot was very predictable, I would like to emphasize the word ""very"". I watched ""I"" with my family and friends and they predicted the whole story after 30 minutes of watching the movie. The plot is like the whole sum of ""Cliché"" The direction was a ""so-so"" or ""run-of-the-mill"" job done by Shankar.The action sequence should be seriously highlighted. As I've read all the other reviews, the action sequence in the bodybuilding competition were praised continuously. In my view, I just realized that a light bodybuilder just lift two heavy bodybuilders at the same time which is beyond the capabilities of human beings. Can Arnold Schwarzenegger do that?Moreover,Director Shankar spent to much on the 5 minute video song sequences. Director Shankar keeps saying that ""I"" is a different movie and it would make an impact globally, I disagree. ""I"" is a typical Indian Tamil musical romantic thriller that has a very weak and predictable plot but Vikram's hard-work is noteworthy and praiseworthy.The CGI is placed erroneously in the movie. Honestly, the CGI is only placed in the song sequences and it is very bad for a big budget movie. I guess ""Avatar"" is way more better than this garbage and it has a lower budget than ""I"".In a nutshell, ""I"" did not hit the spot; dreadful.",negative
I,"I usually do not write reviews on IMDb. But i have to make an exception to this movie. This is the one hell of a epic movie i have watched till date. Starting from the beginning to the end, the movie takes you on a roller-coaster ride. I do not have words to explain Vikram. He proved once again that he is not just a great actor, but also a hard worker too.AR Rehman music is a real treat. Trust me, you will loose yourself listening to music. Apart from vikram, every other co actors did their job well.Overall this movie is best one to watch this weekend. If you got time to spend and willing to watch a movie, then go on and book your seats before someone steels yours.",positive
Brothers,"i was a bit angry, and was my primary reason for writing this review.the main thing i can say about this movie is that its a total worthless copy of the movie Warrior, i mean the basic thing about any movie is its plot and story and if u cant even get your own plot or story then u probably should stop making movies.And really its not that India doesn't have good writers or good stories to be told, so why copy.Besides copying the story from another movie lets review the other things. its got great songs that i gotta say no doubt on that. and the direction is pretty good too. the acting i gotta say was not that up to the mark but then again i automatically start comparing it with the movie Warrior which was phenomenally directed written and the actors did pretty amazing as well.",negative
Brothers,"The Karan Malhotra Directed Movie is a Brilliant Mixture of Emotions and Action. Akshay Kumar-Sidharth Malhotra's Flick has the ability to grip your mind for the whole 156 Minutes. Karan Malhotra has directed it Brilliantly and the Duo(Akshay-Sid) has executed marvelously. According to me, Everything in the movie is perfect. From the Love of David for Monty to the Hate Monty Develops for the Elder Brother. The Tournament R2F is a revolutionary idea in the field of Street Fighting. The Villains and goons of the street become the hero of the country. For Me, The Fights of Monty were the best parts of the movie. Like how he knocks out the champion with just one punch and the next fighter within the first round. The Attitude of Monty was perfect too. Like How he Quits the ring even before the decision of the referee. Also David proves to be the most cleverest fighter of the tournament. He defends himself in the first and second round and then attacks in the third round when the opponent is tired. The Love of Jenny for David and the Affection of David for her daughter was remarkable. The guilt of Gary Fernendez, the hate-and-then-love of David for His Father, the Item Number of Katrina Kaif, The Choice of Fighters, the inspiration of the two brothers, the upsets of the tournament and everything was perfect and I would recommend this Movie as a must watch for everyone. I guess this is another 100-cror movie from Sidharth Malhotra after Ek Villain.",positive
Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran,"I had a very high expectation for this movie as it was based on one of the best success stories of India. However, the way the movie has been portrayed left me completely disappointed. This was supposed to be a serious movie, but to the extent the commercial flavour that has been added to it completely ruins the experience. I was expecting more of Madras Cafe kind of vibe from this movie. THIS MOVIE DEMANDED THAT!I hate when my experience during climaxes of a film is spoiled. Even if a film couldn't do well throughout but handles the climax perfectly, I tend to ignore everything else and like that movie. But in this movie, the climax happened to be the most terribly executed part of the entire movie. The tension build-up was too cold I would say.Some long dialogue deliveries really felt like he/she is DELIVERING A DIALOGUE. Good camera work could have hidden it. I found necessity of no songs in this movie. But they did it, because commercialism had to be done!Ashwat Raina's (i.e. John Abraham) family who has been emphasized so much at the first quarter of the film has been completely ignored towards the end. Just a phone call wasn't enough.The background score in some parts were terrible, giving me the feel of daily soaps. I expected that when I saw it was a production of Zee Studios.All-in-all the the style adopted for this movie was completely unsuited.I understand we are having our nationalism sentiments associated with this event and hence we are feeling good about this movie. But the way this movie was made, I couldn't resist myself from disliking it. Pokhran was one of the best stories India could have made movie on, but definitely not like Parmanu.I wasn't able to recollect any of those proud feelings that I felt when I first read about this India's proudful Pokhran Test success story, by watching this film.
Just two things I liked about this movie I want to mention:
1. The round trolley shot of Abraham at the beginning where he explains about India's need to become a nuclear state,and
2. Boman Irani (he did his best, but still poorly directed)",negative
Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran,"It's a shame that I really had almost no idea about the event it's based on. That very event changed the world's perspective towards our nation and it was indeed a proud moment for us all. PARMANU: THE STORY OF POKHRAN is a mindblowing film. It not only stays true to the event but also makes sure that those who didn't know about it would be able to experience it in a stylish way.PARMANU is a very tightly scripted film. There are thrills, drama and some cool action. Everything is balanced so perfectly that I felt it couldn't get any better than this. There's almost no flaw to find and the lack of musical numbers ensures that a wider audience embraces the film. There are no commercial compromises, and the director has mixed all the elements perfectly to give you a touching patriotic story which proves that unsung heroes can be remembered and honoured on any day. John Abraham is fabulous in this film. He plays a different kind of role and impresses totally, especially in the climax and an action sequence in the second half. Well, I didn't really need to say that since we all know that he's an action hero. This time, he doesn't really play one, but still reminds us of the excellence with which he has mastered this genre. Boman Irani is extraordinary: give him any role and he's gonna play it his way, the perfect way. Diana Penty is impressive and her character is neatly written. Rest of the cast does a splendid job.The review would be incomplete without praising the film's director, Abhishek Sharma whose skilful direction has helped the film become what it became: A perfect entertainer and thought-provoking historical action drama/thriller which also allows for some natural humour to breathe in.Enough of the bashing by critics. This film is awesome and is capable to entertain all ages. PARMANU: THE STORY OF POKHRAN is much more than just a history lesson: it's a phenomenal historical saga which realizes its strengths and thus chooses to remain totally realistic. If you like action dramas/thrillers based on real events, then I would like to congratulate you, since you're definitely in for a treat.",positive
Vishwaroopam,"After reading all the ""awesome"" reviews here I decided to give this movie a go. The movie starts off well but as soon as they start showing Kamaal Hassans past it becomes completely dull. There is no connection between the scenes from his past and future. The plot makes no sense at all. I had to fast forward to see the ending but was disappointed there too. In order to find out what happens next you need to wait for its sequel which I'm sure will be as pathetic as the first. Kamaal Hassan just wanted to show his audience that he too can do a spy role. Please refrain from watching this film. It will save 3 hours of your precious time. My verdict 1/10",negative
Vishwaroopam,"Brilliant story of a spy that is often seen in Hollywood movies. Characterization of Kamal and Rahul Bose as people from same religion (Islam) and fighting for a cause from different perspectives, say it good and bad. The thrilling screenplay that gives surprise every second, while revealing the past of Kamal Haasan. Technical brilliance in action scenes which really takes Indian cinema to next level. Kamal Haasan once again makes sure that his creativity is beyond the imagination of Indian audiences and surprises you every moment.There is nothing controversial in the film as it just shows the two sides of coin. Like a Jamesbond film highlights Britain, Spielberg film highlights America, this Kamal's movie has highlighted Indian spy system. Besides that, this legendary actor commands huge respect for his technical brilliance.However, the movie might appeal only to urban and A-center audiences, as there is no entertainment factor. And, adding entertainment in a movie like 'Viswaroopam' is like degrading the very meaning of creative intelligence. But the enormous budget mounted on this flick, is surely a risk, if Kamal aims only at Indian market.",positive
Sarkar,"This is the worst movie for Vijay, ARM, ARR and overall it's waste of time for audience",negative
Sarkar,"Sarkar - A decently made political drama/thriller film. Thalapathy Vijay proves to be the savior once again with his class. Kudos to the director for taking up such a sensitive topic as story and also to Vijay for enacting this drama. Full marks for that. I'm giving it a 10 for just that.Negatives - Logic might be found missing in some of the scenes. I found one fight sequence unnecessary and an other fight sequence could have been shortened. Varalakshmi Sarathkumar's character had a great villain potential, but screen time was really less and the character went under utilised. Keerthi Suresh and Yogi Babu didn't have much role to play. The first song felt unnecessary.Overall a decent one time watch.",positive
Gunday,"The movie was probably aimed at being on of those a masala flicks with bromance, romance, song sequences, tragic background and what not. But half an hour into the movie and it all went for a toss due to a very very weak script. The on screen appearances of the actors was good but it wasn't really backed by any actual acting.The dialogues were over cheesy and ludicrous in all aspects. Probably Priyanka Chopra was the only watchable element of the movie (or may be I am being biased).Frankly an hour into the movie and i really felt like leaving (I don't know why i didn't). Trust me guys, its one of those movies which is meant to be forgotten and if you haven't watched it and are planning to, then forget the time and money that you are going to waste on this and just save yourself from the agony that might scar you.The only way this movie could be watchable is with a group of friends who are making fun of everything possible whilst the movie plays.",negative

And the movie hasn't even been released in Brazil!!This just shows how good this movie is! Recent far-right political movements in Brazil can't tolerate the truth about their own history of oppression, torture and murder against those who fought against their coward coup on the 60's.Marighella is a must see. And that for many reasons: it's a great movie per si! It's original, dense, poetic, emotional. It completely destroys the current fake narrative of a ""revolution"" by the army at that time, inviting people to call back all that political mess by its real name: a bloody dictatorship.",positive
Jai Ho,"Another year, another aam admi focused movie (in 2013 it was Singh Saab). It is difficult to talk about a Salman movie because lately he has been pretty much formulaic. All his movies are essentially Salaman playing himself along with improbable action, and stupid comedy- the audience though has been lapping it up, prompting a whole generation of solid actors go the Sallu way.Salman plays Jai, essentially a do go-oder, a mathematical genius who can multiply up-to 3*3*3*3, (after that he needs help), an ex army-man with a heart of gold who likes to give bad guys an earful before ending their thankless existence. In today's times, think Somnath Bharti on steroids. Like a good old cowboy he strides around dishing punishments, cracking skulls, breaking bones and occasionally killing anyone who does not adhere to his definition of good, but reserves exceptional ferocity to goons who lays eyes on his family. Jai's eureka is to start a people's movement based on the concept of paying it forward when you do a good deed. But then Salman Khan is anything but aam, and there is very little of a people's movement in Jai Ho. It is a one man mission after all. Jai Ho.Jai takes quite a lot of damage it seems- stabbed, shot, bloodied, beaten black and blue, but then in a matter of seconds he proves that he is Salman Khan after all, when he tears off his shirt, and along with it disappears a knife that was apparently plunged deep in his back. The ludicrity reaches a whole new level when Sunil Shetty rolls in on a tank as Salman's wingman. Towards the end, all that Salman doesn't do is to don the chief minister's cap on his head. But that right belongs to another aam aadmi leader, right?The dialogs are straight off a b grade TV serial, and the music jarring. Tabu and Danny lend a touch of class to an otherwise special appearance filled proceedings. Either the khans were flush with funds, or appearing in a Sallu movie is a major draw- anyone and everyone of Bollywood, including out of work actors such as Aditya Pancholi, Mohnish Bahl, Nauheed Cyrusi, Vatsal Seth, Ashmit Patel, Varun Badola, Yash Tonk appear in bit roles. Daisy Shah may be a Rani Mukherjee look alike but is the inconsequential sallu heroine. Even though she is in the pink of health (pun intended), and puts and dances as well as any, with zero screen presence, and screechy acting skills, we may have seen the last of her. Nukkad's Khopdi features here too, probably playing Khopdi- the drunk. Talk about stereotypes .Can one person make a difference? The original plot is based on Mimi Ledger's excellent 2000 flick, Pay it Forward. Released on the eve of Republic Day, Jai Ho had the potential to be inspiring, pity though in the hands of a myopic director, it descends into a standard mas-ala movie with song, dance, cheap comedy and action.",negative
Jai Ho,"""Jai Ho"" is a Remake of Telugu Film STALIN .. Before this Salman has done successful Remakes as Wanted, Ready And Bodyguard which were exceptional Blockbusters in Bollywood.. Jai Ho is a complete Bonus Bonanza for Salman Fans because till now only the Fans witnessed a Heroic and ""A Larger than Life"" Image of their superstar but ""Jai HO"" is an amalgamation of a great Story with - Drama, Comedy , Action and moreover, A Noble Message, ""If you'd like to Thank someone don't just say thanks, instead Help 3 People and ask those 3 people to Help more 3 People... Genuinely when u'll come out of Theatres after Watching this Movie this message would have been created an Impact in your Minds.. Not only Salman is seen as a Action Hero but also as a Sensible Person who Helps People suffering in Pain.. Sometimes he'll make you Emotional through his touching performance .. The Story revolves around Jai (Salman)an ex Army officer who believes in honest living and not giving in to injustice. Helping those in trouble eventually lands Jai and his family in trouble when he takes on the might of a powerful Minister (Danny Denzongpa). While on one hand, Jai is engrossed in fighting the evil force, on the other, he conceives a novel idea that could have the potential to stir a revolution – help three people and ask them to help three people in return.How that simple idea changes everything for Jai is what the rest of the film is about. The film is a family entertainer which gives us hope for a better future. For those who have a lot of love for Bollywood and cinema in their bosom, should not miss out on this one. The film opens and closes with a moral – ""Thank you mat kahiye instead teen logo ki madad ki jiye aap"". Let's hope this film initiates a ""Thank You Chain"" and creates a history!",positive
Found a Treasure Called Love,"This movie is one of the worst and most boring movies. They are so many songs which don't add anything to the narrative.

Found a Treasure Called Love,"I almost didn't watch this movie due to the repetitive negative reviews here on IMDb. Usually I find reviews here fairly spot-on. But in this case I am convinced we are living in a generation of viewers who have been raised on so much schlock, sex, violence, blood and foul language that they wouldn't recognize a prime movie if it whacked them with a hammer. Either that or we have a set of the most bogus witch-hunt reviews ever. I could count the number of films I would give 10 stars and still have some toes left. This film has everything-- terrific cinematography, good acting (yes, a little hokey in places: intentionally so), a script that if one has a heart at all should bring tears to the eyes repeatedly, humorous moments, fun moments, bad decisions, sacrifice, redemption, hundreds of supporting actors, the most incredibly huge set I have ever seen in any film (they built an entire palace!) -- as well as the full gamut of drama mixed with comedy, music and dance.Many others have discussed the merits of the movie itself; they have done well enough that I don't have to re-hash. What I will focus on is the incredible number of negative reviews present here. We notice a large number of the reviews are similar or identical in writing style. That stands out very clearly-- which is highly suspect. Secondly, a large number of those reviews claim to be written from differing cities in India, yet are all in perfect, pristine English. ""Most boring movie I've ever seen."" We see this phrase repeatedly, in almost identical words. There are too many people giving this 7+ stars and even 10 stars (unusual to see on IMDb) to believe the legitimacy of the number of 1-star ""worst movie ever"" reviews. Such paradox is simply difficult to accept as valid. All I know is I'm in the U.S., I and my sister watched the movie together, and we both loved it. I can be very critical of films and for sure I have seen some real stinkers in my day-- but this movie definitely is not one of them. This has song, dance, a delightful story... and touches the heart more than once. Have your hanky ready. Please, feel free to consider the negative reviews as suspect (at the very least)-- and give this film a try. The best and most valid review is your own.",positive
Thani Oruvan,"A well enacted thriller with a racy screen play portrays the war between the good and the bad (evil). Jayam Ravi's brother Director M.Raja has given so many hits but most of them would be remakes of success films in Telugu. This time he has took quite time to pen his story and screenplay after his last venture Velayudham starting Vijay which has worked quite well even though the basic concept is the same cat and mouse game. Corruption, Corporate mafia, underworld, Pharmaceutical Company's illegal research, Goons, Strict and straight forward IAS, IPS officers working with anti corruption motto, realistic fight with corporate Dons, A Solo Hero with a vision and a supportive lead lady some of the keywords that can describe this movie's plot. The ultimate show stopper of the movie was the performance of the antagonist played by none other than the yester year's charming hero Aravind Samy. He plays Siddharth Abimanyu a suave middle aged notorious scientist and has lifted the role to a different level with his charisma in a sophisticated set up. His comeback as a good hearted priest didn't work out in Kadal but sure this negative role will be a break through character in his career. Mithran (essayed by Jayam ravi ) is the best cop ever who shadows his aim case and moves exactly with his supporting team of friends. Mahima (played by the beautiful dusky Nayantara) who is head over heels with Mithran supports him with her skills. The overall love sequences seemed sensible and mature didn't bore us with instant dream sequences except the one and only song which was bearable. Other than these leads we have Nasser, Thambi Rammaiah (don't know how many movies he will play the same innocent character with the same tone), Vamsi Krishna, Ganesh Venkat Ram, Jay Prakash, Mugdha Godse (of the Hindi movie Fashion fame). On the technical bit like cinematography, editing, BGM, Arts was in place and gave what was needed for a script like this. Except a bit on editing would have made it look perfect. At times it would make you feel and compare portions with Kakha kakha and similar cop movie series, plus Ramana, Nimirndhu nil, E, Thupakki etc Verdict: A good thriller with an over shadowed antagonist which is the current trend where villain takes over easily.",negative
Thani Oruvan,"The movie title itself gave me goose bumps. A thriller is expected after all the promotions. But a thriller with a true meaning and less illogicalstuffs is Thani oruvan. The twist in the beginning scene itself will make you understand what you will watch for the next 2 hours. More than Ravi his brother deserves the applause for scripting something original and keeping the audience thrilled till the end. That's something very rare. But he managed to do that in this flick. But the next main person who should be saluted,awarded,appreciated,loved,and of course all the other synonyms is Aravind Swamy. Can a villain be so loved by everyone?. I think that has happened now. Performance to a next level. Ravi has done a commendable job in first choosing such a script which has more importance to the villain than the hero. And of course at the end everyone will appreciate the only performance which stands out that is Sidharth Abimanyu. An enjoyable ride. I am sure all will love it...",positive
Saala Khadoos,"Sports film are a niche genre in India, and when we talk about boxing, then there is only a few films ever made on the sport. In recent times Mary Kom was a boxing film that made the cash registers ring, however I wasn't a huge fan of the film(while most of India was going gaga for the film). However with this weeks release Saala Khadoos, I can't say the same. Thats because Sale Khadoos is an endearing, heartwarming , and inspirational film. The film even promotes women boxing. Coming from the Raj Kumar Hirani stable (he produced it) one can also see the great social message a film like 3 Idiots, Munna Bhai gave in a film like Saala Khadoos, this Bi-Lingual (Hindi and Tamil) film is destined to win the hearts of its audience, but to a certain extent. While the former films mentioned were classics, Saala Khadoos is far from being in that league, as things such as predictability, being over melo dramatic bog the film down. However when watching the leads Madhavan and Ritika Singh perform one feels goosebumps from there awe inspiring acts. But more on that later.Story wise Adi Tomar had a dream to win the boxing gold for India. Instead, he languished in a nightmare for a decade after his gloves were spiked during a match by his own coach, blinding him in the arena and handing the match to his undeserving opponent. Shattered by his loss, Adi turned to a life of cynical self-destruction. Loyal friends somehow bring him back to boxing as the coach of the low-rated Indian women's boxing team. Adi continues to dream - this time for a fiery young woman. Adi spots in her a champion. So begins a partnership between a man who loves his sport and a girl who loves her freedom. It is the beginning of a beautiful friendship and a journey towards an impossible dream.Acting wise Madhavan gives his career best act as the crazy, angry boxing coach. One can feel his pain and anguish in the film, Maddy has lived the role, and this can be seen in the climax scene when he is fighting his way into the arena, and coaching Madhi from far away. When he says ""Merri Muhammad Ali"", its a tear jerking, great cinematic moment. Ritika Singh performance is a revelation, her raw energy makes her act so believable.She is a talent to lookout for, and she has the best debut awards already locked for next years awards. Nassar is good, and Zakir Hussain plays the clichéd villain but is still menacing. Saala Khadoos is everything a sports film should be the story is endearing, one feels for the characters, its inspirational because its a story of an underdog, its heartwarming because the girl is from a poor family, and the film has great social message of promoting women in boxing. The film even goes into the nitty gritty and talks about boxing and the politics, the sexual exploitation that come with the game. The director Sudha Kongara Prasad must be applauded for making a detailed, good movie on boxing in India, one can see the great effort. Even the films runtime at 1hr 50 min is perfect as the film never lags, its very fast paced and right to the point, however the film still has its negatives. Saala Khadoos is a very predictable film,from when the film starts till the end you knows going to happen, especially if you have seen the trailer. The film also is way too melo dramatic, and at any given moment someone is yelling, crying, and even falling in love. There is no normalcy at times.The whole love track was also not needed.Maybe the director tried to commercialize the film, which is not a good idea for a realistic boxing film. And for a film about a underdog in sports, the film has no novelty, the story gives a deja vu film because a story like this has been seen many times on screen.However all minuses withstanding, what makes one forget any negatives are the films leads chemistry which is absolutely lethal. The coach and boxer, act like fish to water together, together on screen the are just so entertaining to watch together. There bickering, and battering is hilarious, Like they said in the film one is mental, and one is full of anger lets see what happens.Amazing happens. The films action scenes are also to be applauded because they are very realistic, and well choreographed especially the climax action sequence which is a goosebumps inducing fight. Technical aspect wise the production values, the way the film is shot is all very average. The films music is good with the title track being the best.Overall Saala Khadoos is a good watch, and what makes the film a above average watch is Madhavan's and Ritika Singh's performance together they light the screen on fire. Its a honest attempt at highlighting and presenting a good story that should be told.3.25/5* or 6.5/10",negative
Saala Khadoos,"Complaint about this movie is that the story is predictable. Yes. Even Airlift movie's story is predictable. And in case of sports based film there's mostly the same story line. ""A coach/player will lose and eventually win themselves or make someone win at the end"". It's the screenplay which makes the difference here!! Screenplay - No-nonsense and straight to the point. It deals with the characters' screen time perfect. Nothing more. Nothing less. Direction - Narration by the director is really good. Not fast paced. But well paced. Director had brought the things required for the film very well . Be it the acting or the environment.Acting - Ritika Singh steals the show. There aren't words to describe her performance. Only when watching the film we realize. Madhavan as usual sticks to the character and performed just perfect!! A live example for versatile acting. Other supporting characters contribute their best. Only con is that some unknown faces don't make us feel emotional at times.Music - Soundtrack of the film as audio doesn't bring much. But when combined with the frames of the film creates magic!! Santhosh Narayanan has given one of his best works.There are many moments in the film where the wit of the director is highlighted - be it the jokes or the twists or social issue, they have been blended in the picture smooth.Watch it for Ritika Singh, Madhavan, Sudha, Santhosh Narayanan!!",positive
Mardaani,"Nowadays when the so-called superstars of bollywood (Salman, Akshay, SRK etc) make such mindless & nonsensical movies in the name of leave-your- brains-at-home comedies (like Kick & Ready & Dabang & Entertainment & what not), Mardaani is a refreshing change. I am not saying that it's a gem or the best movie out there but it is good. It has a good (although not many twists or turns) story, powerful acting by Rani and the supporting cast, no out-of-context songs and very nice ending.I see a trend that Bollywood heroines are trying to come up with good movies like Kangana in Queen, Revolver Rani; Priyanka in Mary Kom, Fashion; Vidya in Kahani, No one killed Jessica etc where as the 40+ year old ""heroes"" are still stuck in the 90s; churning out stupid movies where the girl is mainly for songs. I don't have a problem with those kind of movies too if they are decent; which many aren't. I love a good comedy or action movie as much as I enjoy a serious one. But the movies made by the male ""superstars"" are not even funny or entertaining; though surprisingly, those movies are in the 200 crore etc club.I hope we as an audience start to appreciate some diversity that movies like Mardaani portray.",negative
Mardaani,"Mardaani is a movie that despite an unimaginative plot and predictable narrative engrosses you in its fabric. Rani Mukerji is pitch perfect in the role of a super-cop that is rightly hued, far from the floss and swagger of Chulbul Pandey and Singham. She is real, gritty and every bit brilliant. Though the film's climax loses itself in melodrama, this is a film that has its heart in the right place and tells a pertinent story at a time when it must be heard.Rani Mukerji with no make up, stern face maintains her strong demeanor. The actress is non dramatic on purpose and that did the trick for me. She is far from the pomp and show of masala cop films and that subtlety blows your mind. I am ecstatic that the lady has returned in a role that does justice to her caliber.Tahir Bhasin is a revelation and quite interestingly lives up to Rani's stature. The chase between him and Rani is built brilliantly mostly because of his conviction in rendering such brilliance to his character. His diction and twang both blend in well drawing one's attention even further.",positive
Yip Man: Jung gik yat zin,"We get it, yip man, ip man, what ever the dude name is.He's a great grandmaster, a teacher of Bruce Lee (well, Bruce found another branch of martial arts long after anyway, but that's not the point), probably fought with the Japanese and stuff With all due respect to Master Ip (the real master Ip)enough with this crap please, Anthony Wong is not a martial artist, and as much as the fight look OK-ish, Eric Tsang? Come on HK Film makers, you can do better than this, give me overrated gangster love drama of the 90 or even a one man gun frenzy heroes like Chow Yun Fat Enough of this overblown Ip Man shits, you've got 4000 years of Chinese History, pick one and make a fresh story out of it.What's next? Ip man love life?Can't believe Anthony Wong would wanna do this kind of cheap movies, it's not that bad in itself, but the fact that they cheaply trying to milk every penny from the grandmaster ip itself is disgusting",negative
Yip Man: Jung gik yat zin,"The most interesting aspect between Herman Yau-Anthony Wong collaborations is that their partnership had its roots in Hong Kong Category III horror. Ebola Syndrome is still one of the most disgusting movies I have ever seen and been guiltily entertained by. Forget Outbreak or Contagion, Ebola Syndrome was a far more disturbing movie about a viral outbreak. Forget Hannibal Lecter, Anthony Wong truly played a disturbing sociopath in that movie. The point is: they're not afraid to delve into the gritty, the ugly and the disgusting.Set against the big commercial movie cog machine and the Ip Man franchise, the majority of Yau-Wong penchant for grittiness is diluted and only some of it remains in Ip Man: The Final Fight. It is that essence of the grittier and the uglier sides of Ip Man that makes out for the more interesting parts in Ip Man: The Final Fight, but it's also the film's major weakness because it never treads far enough from familiar territory.What the film ends up being more like tonally is a combination of the Wilson Yip- Donnie Yen Ip Man films and Bruce Lee My Brother, where it is loosely glossing over the details of the grandmaster's life and dramatically punching up the action so it can allow for fight scenes, but also providing a retro-gaze of Hong Kong accompanied with a celebrity guest-list cameos.For example, it's been said that Ip Man sported an opium habit. The concept is telegraphed but never truly explored. Another example is Hong Kong actor Liu Kai Chi gives a cameo as Ip Man's friend who is suffering from poverty. They start what might be a potentially interesting storyline but it never finishes itself. Much of the film is like that.There are about several subplots running through the story and they all end up as separate vignettes that do not rise above the sum of it's parts. For a biopic drama, that's a problem because it does not provide an unified narrative goal. This is not an editing issue. The story was based on Ip Chun's stories of his father and it is as if seemed like the screenwriter noted them down as told and the director literally shot them that way. So I attribute this issue to lazy writing. The retroactive voice-over device ends up killing a lot of the drama. The scene will be happening and the voice-over will cut in summing up the rest of the scene in past tense. It keeps glossing over by stating what happened instead of letting the audience experience what's happening in the now.Anthony Wong is very natural as Ip Man. He looks most like the real-life version of Ip Man and actually adopts a Foshan accent. He breathes many colors into the role and the scenes with Ip Man and his students is the heart of the film. Anthony Wong is pretty much the best thing about this movie and his performance alone is the price of admission.Eric Tsang has a great supporting role as a Crane style master who befriends Ip Man. There is a self-referential joke where Tsang says being a 'clan master' (獎門人) is difficult, a reference to his famous television game show, that was self-serving and unnecessary. Tsang and Wong share an awesome fight together. Not a lot of people remember that Eric Tsang started out as a stuntman; the fight looks very authentic. They were really smashing their forearms together. Eric Tsang is a badass.Something I noticed about the cinematography was there were way too many crane shots in this film. There's a scene that ends on a connective moment between two characters and then it cuts to a crane shot backing away presenting a view of the entire rooftop set. I have a theory about this. In Hong Kong, booking a crane from a production house is a planned expense and usually you would require more crew members or more time to set up a crane shot. Production houses in the Mainland will give crews an entire film equipment package in their deals, which includes cranes and jibs. With the cheap labor and higher amount of crew members, a crane shot can be set up much faster in the Mainland. As a recent occurrence, a lot of Chinese productions lead by Hong Kong directors have recently been very crane shot-heavy. Hong Kong directors, this needs to stop. You have to remember to pull back every once and a while.Just as a small footnote, I really hated the Bruce Lee cameo. Playing Bruce Lee in a film is by no means an easy feat but the actor they chose was abysmally awful. He made Bruce Lee look like a rich asshole sellout. It was not fun, nor did it work as a pop culture reference.Overall, I enjoyed this film, but I do not think it works completely as a standalone piece. It seems to fit as the final piece to this whole line of Ip Man films. In a way, I can't help it because they've made so many movies about Ip Man in such a short time.With every film, I see a little more of who this man was, what his legacy was and it had me thinking about even what being a good teacher means. I still think The Grandmaster is the best Ip Man film. They really don't need to make any more Ip Man movies. And if they do (and I think they are because I saw a poster for an Ip Man 3 with Donnie Yen), please do the story with Bruce Lee and get him right.For more reviews, please visit my blog at http://hkauteur.wordpress.com/",positive
N.H 10,"Thrillers are like mathematics question, either you get maximum marks or you get zero, there is no scope of pass mark. Screenplay is very kiddies. When they want to add gun in plot, they shown that the male protagonist is very close to Delhi DIG, so he gets easily a gun license but when it comes to their rescue, even after informing the DIG, Police didn't even tried to find out, which is very easy if one has close of a DIG, state doesn't matter. A DIG have enough power to influence any other state Police. If DIG called back and the person couldn't pick the phone, it was enough to make him suspicious, he can easily find out the location and send the help. A person, who is clearly unaware of the village streets but chases the hard seasoned goons in a SUV where goons are aware of every corner of streets but they run for saving their life, Even they know that her only strength is SUV, she is not physically strong, then why did not they try to trap the vehicle in a narrow street!? This type of scene, only a person can conceive who have never visited a village. Fact, running a SUV freely in every corner of a village street is not possible and goons could have hide anywhere and trapped the person because reversing s SUV in streets is almost impossible. Even standing in a corner can save you from SUV and force that person to come out from the vehicle. There is musical program in village but after so much chasing and drama there is not a single person in village!? This musical program was stuffed for showing the village deserted. In introduction scene it's very clear that goons are ruthless but protagonist tried to chase them without any planning and that also just for threaten them with the help of gun!? Why did the person going for honor killing take along a mental retarded person, just for stuffing some thrill!? It is height of naiveness in screenplay. They show in a shot that it is full moon but took this fact for granted in lighting. Every frame is almost bright light. Performance wise Anushka Sharma is just for shouting and limping.

N.H 10,"First, let me say I am NOT Indian, but I have watched Bollywood movies for over 10 years--a lot of them. Next, let me say that last year I saw 92 (yes, 92) movies in the cinema--that's not counting movies on DVD or on TV.NowNH10 is the BEST movie I have seen of all the movies I saw last year and so far this year.I think the comments about it being copied from Eden Lake (which I've not seen) or other movies in this genre might be true to some extent, but that's not fair. Shakespeare copied a lot of his plots from Boccaccio's Decameron. So what? So there have been a lot of other movies about a gang terrorizing a couple? So what? It's how you do it that counts. It's like a football play (American!)--you can have 100 teams run the same play, but one team does it best, and they win. NH10 wins.Yes, you knew something bad was going to happenbut when? How? To whom? And the false leads at the beginning of the film kept me in suspense. Of COURSE Arjun was an idiot-- that's the formula of these types of movies. If everyone were alert and smart, you wouldn't have a good horror movie! But I have to say I almost yelled at the screen, ""No, you idiot, don't leave your gun in the car!"" It's all in the execution.Anushka is one of my favorites, I have to admit. She always plays the strong woman, and Meera was certainly a strong woman. To be the center of the movie and on screen for almost every minute is quite an achievement, and she did it beautifully. It took a lot of skill to keep the suspense up throughout the movie, but it succeeded. There was really no way to tell until the last few minutes how it would all end--it could have gone several different directions.Also I have to applaud the director--and Anushka the producer--for leaving the studio and going out into real world. The Italians discovered this c. 1960, and Indian films would be much better if more of them did it. I know there are difficulties in filming in a crowded city, but there are ways",positive

Holiday: A Soldier is Never Off Duty,"Holiday - A Solider Never Off Duty, an Akshay Kumar show all the way... On leave from the Indian Army, Virat Bakshi (Akshay Kumar) is bride hunting and meets Sahiba (Sonakshi Sinha). Along with his cop buddy (Sumeet Raghavan) he catches a terrorist who is part of a sleeper cell. From then on, he is engaged in a cat-and-mouse game with a terror mastermind (Freddy Daruwala).Firstly thank god Akshay Kumar has not done his stereotypical over the top comic act here. Akshay Kumar is probably one of the best action stars Bollywood has ever seen and he reminds us again why he is on the top of list. His character in Holiday is serious, smart, calm & composed. Somewhere in the film he reminded me of Special 26's Arjun. He steals each & every moment of the film. It's a treat to watch him in this avatar. It's difficult to imagine anyone else in the role. He sinks deep into the character of an army man. It feels like the role was tailor made for him. With this film he shows how versatile as an actor he is. I wish he chooses these types of roles over those so called ""entertaining"" & ""comic"" ones.Why on earth (read Bollywood) do we need a heroine in a film like this? Sonakshi Sinha is one big flaw in Holiday. She irritates the viewers at regular intervals just like Kajal Agarwal did in Special 26 or more than her. She is like those commercial breaks which come during a nail- bitting cricket match. The romantic track between her and Akshay Kumar & the songs could've easily been chopped off from the film. This would make Holiday more interesting to watch.Debutant Freddy Daruwala tries hard to be Vidyut Jamwal of Force but doesn't create much of an impact. Sumeet Raghavan plays his part perfectly. Govida's cameo was entertaining but was needless in the film. Despite there being several loopholes in the script director A.R. Murgadoss manages to keep the audiences glued to their seats throughout the movie excluding songs & the romantic angle. The film's story is nice especially the second hour. Also the film could've easily edited by 15- 20 minutes.The scene where Akshay Kumar rescues girl hostages is the highlight of the movie. A special mention for the action director Greg Powell for doing a wonderful job. I'll rate it 7/10. Holiday has flaws but is an enjoyable flick. Akshay Kumar takes the film to another level. Even non Akshay Kumar fans will love him in this avatar. Holiday A Soldier Never Off Duty is for both, classes & masses.",negative
Holiday: A Soldier is Never Off Duty,"Akshay Kumar is an amazing actor. His stunts are jaw breaking no doubt. But, the film hits the write notes. Sonakshi Sinha was wasted. Freddy Daruwala makes a god villain. This is an edge of the seat thrilled that will keep you hooked right till the end!It's just as hard to imagine ""Holiday"" without Akshay as it is to imagine last week's elegiac and thoughtful ""Citylights"" without Rajkummar Rao.They both breathe life into their characters from different respiratory systems.We often tend to think the grammar and language of mainstream cinema to be far easier to convey than the language of the so-called serious cinema.Wrong! A full-on massy product, which doesn't resort to outlandish inanities or outright vulgarity, is the most difficult form of filmmaking. In ""Holiday"", Murugadoss has some absolutely unflinching support from his writers and technicians, all out to create that increasingly elusive cinematic entity .The perfect entertainer.Not that ""Holiday"" is not without its flaws. What would life in the movies be without those?Sonakshi Sinha's role and presence in the plot can at best be termed as comic relief. She is less diva, more Mehmood. It is interesting to see how the director weaves the romantic element into what is predominantly a rugged man-to-man confrontation between an armyman on leave and a super-intelligent terrorist, who is seen to work out not from a dingy warehouse, but a normal home teeming with the scents and images of domestic harmony.",positive

I cant think of enough bad adjectives for this movie. I couldn't avoid watching it, but do yourselves a favor and stay away from it. I was feeling embarrassed watching it, the makers should have been ashamed. Lets take one example of the multitude in this movie. a car is fitted with a bomb that would burst if the speed is reduced. So Saif removes it while the car is doing 100+, but lo and behold, the bomb has no wiring connected to anything in the car. its just stuck there, he pulls it and throws it away.

Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods,"OK just to make it clear, the guys who reviewed it and gave it a 9 out of 10, aren't DBZ fans at all.I've loved that manga since early 90's, as a teenager, and loved all OVA (first broly being the best of them all) . I brought in a friend that is a huge fan too, relaxed, closed curtains, watched the movie... and we waited ; we waited for the story to skip the poor jokes and so on. Until I realised it was exactly designed the same way the previous Tarble anime was, poor humour, poor enemy's design, motivation, etc. The realisation is OK, but I really can't believe Akira Toriyama took part into that , and if so, I would be ultimately disappointed. How can people consider that to be a dragon ball movie, when there is only kawai fan service? Bills, is an absolutely empty shell character, the story is for kids. If you're over 10 , you might really be upset about this being called Dragon Ball. Only time we probably enjoyed was the overall 5-10 minutes fighting sequence, and that was really to say that something was still kind of brought back from the old DBZ and updated with today's technical improvements. So to summarize : if you're a real hardcore DBZ fan (meaning you didn't even wasted your time watching GT, as I did) , you'd better skip this movie, even if I know curiosity will prevail, but don't' have huge expectations, this is simply the WORST dragon ball movie I've ever seen. My buddy asked me seriously if that was a dragon ball parody movie or if it was real... Please Toei guys and Toriyama san , if you read that, please never do that again to your real fans. You just dealt a fatal blow to that magic manga that dragon ball is , and I'm not sure I'd go for a next movie if it's so bad. You have been warned guys.",negative

I can only think that this was directed and funded by people who dislike DBZ, that would describe the plot with unforgivable holes all over the place and the so called action which is dreadful and painful to watch, Goku probably needs to sue DBZ for terrible misrepresentation of his character.

Bills provides much of the comedy in his own unique manner as one of the best new DBZ Characters ever. Speaking of new characters, I'm pleasantly surprised by Frieza's new minions, especially Sorbet as he's actually useful throughout the movie and not just fodder like the rest of Frieza's army. The invasion scene was amazing as it put the Z warriors back in the spotlight and gave the movie some much-needed tension. Especially Gohan; not since his fight with Cell has he been this badass!Speaking of badassery, the very definition of the word, Vegeta, finally gets his time to really shine (there are no stupid bingo scenes in this one...) - it is straight up brawls in that over-the-top fashion we all know and love delivered by the Prince of all Saiyans.In the end, the 15th DBZ Film featured the return of the greatest Anime villain of all time: Frieza in a Battle of Gods with the Super Saiyan God Goku.

The Villain,"To start, there are some basics that need to be stated: 1. Shradhha Kapoor is a terrible actress as yet 2. Just because an actor does a negative role wearing different coloured contacts doesn't make that character's rendering 'OOH LA LA' or the actor great 3. Keeping deadpan expressions throughout a movie DOES NOT show intensity 4. A rickshaw-wallah from the streets of UP/ Bihar would've done better acting than Kamaal Khan - and probably for free - Suri could've saved money right there for Ekta Kapoor 5. Making a statement like ""I wasn't born with dialogues in my head and I have been inspired by the films I have watched and the books I have read"" DOES NOT mean that Mohit Suri did not copy the movie. It still means he's a thief.That's that. Other than the points above, the movie was horrendously bad. Remo's parts were pathetic. Deshmukh never fit into the role. Malhotra barely lived through it. S Kapoor tried to whiz through her parts, and is good only from a eye candy perspective. Shaad Randhawa was spectacularly unconvincing. Aamna Sharif was kinda stupid.But Suri included waterboarding :) Atta boy, that's keeping with the times.

The non- linear plot format was intriguing, especially when compared to modern and rather stale mainstream Bollywood films. The various characterizations as well as embedded parallelism and circular plot progression can also provide good post-movie conversations. Despite reading negative reviews about Malhotra, a all I can say about him is wow. Not only is he magnetic on screen but he did exactly what he had to. He doesn't have many lines in the film, but he manages to convey his character's issues so well! Riteish was very good--I wanted to hurt him myself, and Shraddha was also very good.

Seeking vengeance, he goes on a rampage and gets himself suspended, only to meet Dhar (Bachchan), a widowed and physically disabled chess enthusiast, who is fighting his own devils after his teen daughter was killed in a mysterious accident. They become friends, and so starts a game of chess as Daanish becomes a friendly yet courageous horse for Dhar to find his daughter's killer.Slow motion and suspended audio hook effects in the initial sequences marvelously entices its audience's attention, and it stays that way through the first act. However, Hydari's character evokes a sort of necessary but terse drama into the narrative which continues to happen throughout the movie. With good dialogs and a well-written screenplay, stylistic antagonists appear and drive the story forward. Mukesh's aura is appreciably different for what he's worth, and Nambiar fancily uses his charm to herald a new type of villain into Bollywood that is away from the deadpan elements we have been seeing in celluloid these past years.However, the story has one too many flaws. Minor ones like Dhar driving a vehicle without his limbs in place can be forgiven, but if one digs deeper into the story that lays itself out in the second act, one will realize that the game which started with 8 ferocious pawns only has one pawn left and it is up to this pawn to take the film forward to a conclusive end. Of course it does, and it does beautifully, but the speed of this transition of a humdrum crime case turning into a thriller is too fast. Flip flops between the drama and the case affects the narrative, only to create an unrest in the audience.So, as the pawn sets out to find the mysterious wazir, queen dies, and the king is high on vodka. Since the queen is dead, the game is more or less over. The wonderful climax is all that saves the pawn from going out on a limb, and manages to salvage the whole game.Cast is brilliant; Akhtar and Bachchan are both good, but one will find the latter more believable in his character. Hydari just mops and sobs, while Mukesh does better acting in his 60-second space than in all his rest of the filmography combined. All said and done, Nambiar's attempt thankfully does not get convoluted, and is read out clearly in its 100 minute running time, but still the story has its flaws and the gist of it is nothing new that our palettes haven't tasted before.BOTTOM LINE: Bejoy Nambiar's Wazir is an inventive thriller whose base story may be ordinary, but watch out for the titular character, for he may impress you with his faith and power and sheer thirst for retribution.GRADE: C+Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES",negative
Wazir,"I have waited for many days for this movie to release.. I have also been hearing about this film when it was just written on a paper by Vinod Chopra. and since the i day saw the trailer.It was so gripping with Amitabh Bachchan and Farhan Akhtar playing some serious roles in it. and yes!! Farhan Akhtar cant do anything wrong..he proved this again!! i saw the movie today with very controlled expectations because 2015 was the year of disappointments like Roy and all.. The movie started in a very first shot.. sudden characters introduced..the screenplay,bringing forward the characters and adorable performances by Akhtar and Sir Bachchan.. Amitabh is still one of the most power pack performers in India. 90 minutes of the movie never disappointed me because of the twisted twist in the end!! Surely the movie,as Vidhu Vinod Chopra said earlier that The plot revolves around the rules of the chess..sacrifices,assassinations,authorities and loyalty were its ingredients.. May be Indian audience isn't still prepared for these kind of sharp stories(and i don't expect they will be) Movies like Dilwale and Prdp are regarded as good movies.. and i see no chances Indian Audience gonna improve their perspective for the movies that deserves appreciation and by the way i also have twist in the end for you readers...i.e the title of this review is for Masala movie lovers :) thank you :)",positive
Kaabil,"Hrithik Roshan tries hard and offers us a great performance but the film plays strictly by numbers and you can see everything coming from a mile. The movie begins with romance between two people who cannot see which is full of cliché and the scenes that just makes you cringe. I have seen old serials having way better romance development scenarios between normal couple, but this was between two blind people. It should give you this warm-touching feelings, but it catastrophically suffers from awkward expressions and dreadful acting, then their relationship goes into fast-forward pace in a song and both are ultimately married except a tragedy befalls the couple, and then things gone awry.-And this is where movie truly suffers from, you see at every point movie desperately tries to make it look serious and dark except it fails at every point. You have an item song, right after a blind guy's blind wife gets raped and I should mention she got raped twice, and then she committed suicide. I was feeling so frustrated at that point towards the writers who I don't know what crack they were smoking when they thought of adding an item song when the movie suddenly goes so dark and negative. As a Man, I just felt terrible and horrible, we just had seen a blind wife brutally getting raped. I can't imagine how women felt when they went to watch this movie. After that, we have your typical mouse and cat revenge story with tons and tons of plot holes, at that point all I felt is that this movie is playing with my emotions and feelings.1. The very first plot hole is that A post-mortem is carried out as soon as possible after the suicide on behalf of the coroner as part of the investigation to establish the cause of death. It usually takes place within one or two days of the death, but none of that happened. I guess someone forgot how the laws and rules work before writing the story.2.The main reason it turns into a revenge story because the protagonist (Hrithik) couldn't bring justice to his late wife because the person who raped his wife (Rohit) is the brother of Ronit who is actually a minister which is established this late into the story out of nowhere and misuses his corrupt powers to control the cops. Okay, I might have understand this if this movie was made in 70s-80s, but this is 2016, no one gets away with such brutal crime these days, and he was not even a big shot. He is just some small unknown corporate minister, don't ask me, the movie never tells us that either.3. From start till the end, you will constantly feel that the movie is missing something, it just feels so condensed, the movie repeatedly goes back and forth between the home where Hrithik lives, the police station, the telephone booth and one or two more new locations where Hrithik takes his revenge on the culprit which are exactly the same locations that you will see in the first half. The movie never goes or develop further beyond that, it just feels like a B-grade budget movie.4. The movie takes no effort into developing any sort of character development or their personality like why the protagonist is blind where are his parents, why the Heroine is blind where are her parents? The villains in this movie has no motivations either, they are plainly dumb like a villains drawn by a school kid to further glorify protagonist.5. As for the revenge, the protagonist comes with a brilliant plan, he has a talent for mimicry and can make lots of different voices and noises, so his plan is to make culprits fight each other by mimicking their voices magically and that's ladies and folks the brilliant revenge plan the writers thought of. I thought they were making a serious movie, but at this point it felt like a cheap comedy movie.6. His revenge is all about killing, but he never thinks of exposing them to the media or public, so that the people can realize, how corrupt is everyone and he will be doing a great job for other women and couples, so that they won't have to go through what he went through. He even completely forgot about the cops who took money from the minister, so that they won't take his case. He even befriends one of them later into the story, WTH. You should be killing those cops too if one of them did their job right, your wife might be alive right now.7. The worst part is the conclusion when the cops discovers that it was after all the protagonist doing all the murders, so to gather all the proves they check the call recording and went to the phone booth where he makes all those calls. So to match person, the cop takes out Hrithik's photo to ask whether he comes in daily to make regular calls. It was like the whole cop force was depending on this one alone proof, but the guy turned out to be a blind too and everyone returned empty-handed. So let me get this straight, are you telling me that in one small location Hrithik manage to find a blind woman and also a blind person who coincidentally takes care of a local phone booth too. Is Hrithik really is blind? How did he manage to find an other blind person, but guess what? The movie doesn't bother to explain that to you either.:Honestly, I can go on and on about how bad this movie is and Can Hrithik Roshan act? No question about it. Can Hrithik hack it, in Kaabil, a film that gives him every opportunity to gain lost ground? That's a toughie.",negative
Kaabil,"Awesome movie....Hrithik is back.A smart film well acted by Hrithik ,Yami,Ronit,Rohit.But,the highlight of the film is Hrithik's bravura performance. He is vulnerable as a lover and menacing as a killing- machine. It is Hrithik's film from the word go. He is there in almost every scene, and he seems to be in control of the proceedings. As a person who has suffered and is holding himself back from crying, he has done fairly well. Yami Gautam, like Ronit Roy, is already typecast as a wife/lover who leaves her partner midway. Hrithik Roshan and Sanjay Gupta consciously don't project Rohan Bhatnagar as someone you should pity. This works and you realise this is the story of an underdog you want to win. But you need more than a few 'Kamzor mat samajh' kind of dialogues to completely root for Rohan. Barring the regular approach to filmmaking, Kaabil embellishes Hrithik credential as a fine action hero.A must watch!!!!!!!!",positive
Chennai Express,"This Movie is really Boring.. Even though first Half is better and entertaining, movie eventually becomes so irritating after interval. My rating is 1 out of 10. Deepika's acting is good, but so many unwanted drama scenes are inserted in the movie.. which makes it a headache. Story is not that much interesting, and could be completed within 1 Hour and 50 Minutes. But No...!! Rohit Shetty pulled it with boring dialogs and drama scenes. Songs starts when they are undoubtedly NOT REQUIRED. there is a part in movie when there are 2 songs in 15 minutes of interval. Ending fight is too long to tolerate. and finally, movie ends in a DDLJ style, which is the most predictable from the maker of the movie..",negative

I wanted to walk out of the theater in the first ten minutes itself, but somehow sat in for the whole movie. The movie starts with an absurd fighting sequence that is stretched beyond any reason. The movie is too cheesy and Salman Khan looks like a dimwit for even agreeing to act in this movie. No character, no substance and a total waste of time! The whole story revolves around Salman Khan like any of his new movies, and tries hard to project him as a larger than life figure with cheap antics.",negative

Mohenjo Daro,"Same ol story, A simple farmer who saves a beautiful girl and falls in love with her. He then must challenge and fight against overwhelming odds. We come to know that the city is ruled by a tyrant n his son is engaged to the same girl.1)Puzzling why this film is set in the Indus Valley Civilization, given the alarming lack of attention to detail. I will not get much into historical inaccuracies but jus a few laughable inaccuracies. 2)Characters seem to have found razors n scissors. Nicely trimmed sideburns, hair n moustaches. 3)Lead actress is tribal only in her headdress. With her headdress, she looks more like Santanico pandemonium from Dusk till dawn. Her thigh-high slit skirt is straight from the red carpet. 3)Majority of historians agree that females had bangles all the way up their arms and nothing else on bodies. 4)The story is set in 2016 BC, thousands of years prior before the world's first gymnasium was invented. Lead actor is ripped with lean muscles. 5)Now coming to Hrithiks acting. He has been the same in every character he has played in each of his films. Same ol lean muscles, same hair style n same accent. His cheeks shake when he's angry, and his voice becomes ever more pronounced while expressing rage. These are all traits the actor displayed in his debut film, 'Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai', and which remain unchanged 16 years. The same was in Agneepath n Bang bang. 6)Something to laugh about- our hero Hrithik wrestles a rubber crocodile. Badly done. 7)The fights in the colosseum. Wow man. Gladiators in mohenjo daro. Still very badly done. 8)Horses in mohenjo??? This movie is an epic disaster of biblical proportions. Boring, full of clichés. The editin is bad, screenplay is one of the worst, acting was horrible by all except Kabir bedis. The direction is pathetic n very dull n stale cinematography.",negative

The film takes you back all the way to 2016 BC and will make you believe that whatever is shown on screen is so damn true. Such is the charismatic work of the film-maker and kudos to him for pulling off such a spectacular feat. The camera angles focus on every inch of the city and its all woven together really well. Thumbs up to the team of Mohenjo Daro on this one! Verdict: A must watch! These kind of movies come rarely in Bollywood and Mohenjo Daro should never be missed at any cost. There is love, drama, action, romance and to top it all, there is an ancient civilization shown so perfectly that you'll end up falling in love with it.I will rate Mohenjo Daro 9 out of 10!! Go and watch",positive
Tiger Zinda Hai,"These are a few scenes which killed my neurons:
1) Salman's entry scene with wolves is funny and his kid is irritating.
2) As the number of terrorist soldiers increased, Salman switched to bigger guns. At one point, there were 200 soldiers and our hero picked the biggest gun he can find, stood at one place and kept shooting. FYI these 200 soldiers were also shooting back but surprisingly they all missed.
3) They portrayed a big villain in the movie, which of course required a big plot for him to go down. Throughout the movie he was seen with hundreds of soldiers at his disposal but as the movie came to an end and it was high time the villain was killed, they showed him roaming around Salman with just a knife.
4) To kill salman (who was tied to a chair), the villian didn't shoot him. He put him in a room full of toxic gas, asked his men to wear gas mask and then go inside and shoot him.
5) Salman and Katrina escaped a whole city under airstrike, within 3 SECONDS. 
6) Dialogues were written by a kid. Villain: Tu mujhe rokk ke dikha. Salman: Dum hai toh tu mujhe rokk ke dikha.
7) Salman's colleague tells him that it was impossible to diffuse the bomb (tells him twice). Salman tells him, its a matter of country's pride and his colleague diffuses it within seconds.
8) Action scenes had several explosions, most of them happened in empty cars with no enemy around. Didn't understand the director's obsession with exploding empty cars. 
9) Whole movie was formula based: Take what work's best for Indian audience (fuck logic/acting/talent).This list can go on. In simple words, whole movie was bleh. To many of the body builders, single guys/one sided lovers, Muslim youths and others.... please stop being a blind fan.",negative

Kesari,"There is subtle exaggeration to stress on a certain point, and there is blatant exaggeration to the point of absurdity. This movie like all bollywood films does the latter.
For some reason Bollywood has to demean all other community in order to advance their own depictions of valor and courage without exception. For example, all Britishers shown on film has to be inherently sadists, arrogant and abusive and derive personal pleasure from abusing Indians.
Reality, not all Brits were cruel and some even thought highly of Indians and were friends. Many britishers were born in India and even remember their birthplace with pride.In bollywood, the enemy is always backstabbing cowards and there are no exception. Whereas the Indians are always ready to sacrifice. In this movie probably the better course would have been to keep the Afghans as nameless and faceless tribals, more as a horde.Too many unnecessary details added that do nothing to move the plot forward. Understanding this film was completed with budget constraints, I choose not to delve into goofs and factual, technical and historical flaws. But I must say, the makeup, most of all was the least convincing. Being a war, one would expect a lot more gore and blood than a PG rated movie.Last;y I guess we would have to wait till Hollywood decides to pick up this story and makes a film on it.",negative

Assault on Wall Street,Uwe Boll is known as one of the worst directors ever known to be in the film industry for making movies for big budgets and making absolutely nothing back from them.hes hated by all the directors in Hollywood and is mocked by people all over the world.his last few movies have been universally panned by critics all of them adapted from popular video games.after owners of well known game metal gear solid refused to sell the rights to Uwe Boll because his history as a director.i think he finally woke up and smelled the smoke because his latest film Assault on wall street is actually good.The film stars Dominic Purcell and Erin Karpluk .the film starts as Jim a security guard for an armored truck who is struggling to pay for his ill wife who is recovering from cancer and Jim must find ways to pay for his wife's treatment after his disastrous investment his stockbroker advised him to make.he soon looses everything he has and decides to take extreme measures to get revenge on the rich and greedy people who got him into the situation hes in.although the film starts off slow it somehow manages to keep you interested and you sympathize with Jim and actually start to root for him even though you know what hes doing is wrong.it picks up near the end and to be honest it impressed me even though Uwe Boll has gone really dark for this one.with a A+ performance by Dominic Purcell and Erin Karplukthis is a film Uwe Boll can actually be proud of and not have to worry about being universally panned.many people will watch this movie and give it a bad review just because of Uwe Boll past and because they quite frankly don't like him or his methods but thats not what film is about.the film is a huge improvement over his previous films and all i can say is Uwe Boll keep it up stay away from the video game adapt ions and concentrate on your own work.now I'm not saying this film is amazing but it is a damn good film.6.5/10,negative

That's how the strong survive, and the weak die off.""I have never before seen any movie that has the steel cajones to so blatantly and succinctly call out the names of the Elites in this country, and to describe so eloquently the truth behind this country's bloody criminal history.

I laughed, I cried, and in the end I cheered for the downtrodden protagonist as he led his Assault on every person who profited from his financial demise and devastating personal losses.

Madras Cafe,"'Madras Cafe,' while viewed as a political thriller with special effects and the whole 'bells and whistles,' is nothing more than a racially and politically motivated movie. The film takes place in Sri Lanka during the 1980's when India got involved in the ethnic conflict between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL).It is about an Indian agent from the Research & Analysis Wing (RAW) of the Indian intelligence along with Indian Peace Keeping Forces (IPKF). During their tenure between 1987 to 1989, according to Amnesty International, ""the IPKF along with the GOSL have been engaged in gross human rights violations against the Tamil population of Northeast Sri Lanka, otherwise known as Tamil Eelam."" Why this movie is racially motivated is, because all the bad guys in the film are Tamil. But, not only, that, the LTTE, which is of course proscribed as a 'terrorist' organization in India and in several countries, is misrepresented. Basically, the truth of the history has been twisted, leave alone incorrect. The producer of the film stated that he spent 7 years studying the conflict, but failed on several accounts, that the Tamil Liberation group prohibits drinking and smoking. Even their salute is incorrect in the film.The film further portrays the Tamil rebel leader as a power hungry and incompetent person. Furthermore, it portrays the Government of Sri Lanka, and India as the heroes of the movie. This is no different than making a movie praising the Gestapo of Adolf Hitler in his fight against 'Jewish terrorism' in Germany! Further, all the characters are non-Tamil, while it does not surprise me that the film was screened in US, Canada, and UK in separate theaters with one for Tamil and one for Hindi. This film also is causing a division, not only between North and South India, but between Tamils and Malayalees of the Southern Indian state of Kerala for the fact that all the heroes from India are Keralites, while the bad guys are Tamil. But, even worse, the Malayalee characters are played by actors and actresses of Northern Indian origins not resembling those from Kerala.Now, why is this movie politically motivated? The answer is clear. Sri Lanka has been condemned by International organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Right Watch for its war crimes and crimes against humanity during and after it's final stages of their battle in Northern Sri Lanka. Numerous videos and footage of rapes, torture, and extra-judicial killings have submerged exposing the Genocide of Tamils in Sri Lanka. Also, the upcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Colombo, Sri Lanka and the possibility of an International Investigation of War Crimes committed in Sri Lanka. Another reason for this film to be released is to give more points to the Indian National Congress to win again in 2014. There is no doubt, that both the Sri Lankan Government and the Congress Party of India has financed this film. Furthermore, that through an independent international investigation into war crimes committed in Sri Lanka, India's name will come out specifically from the Congress Party of India, and Indian representatives in the UN.'Madras Cafe' puts the Tamil people in a bad light, and not doubt, restaurant owners in Western countries that go under the name 'Madras Cafe.' Madras in fact was the former name of Chennai, which is the capitol of Tamil Nadu state of South India. No Tamils will support this film with the exception of a few for monetary gain. Other films banned were those such as 'Vishwapooram' and a YouTube movie mocking the prophet Muhammad. This film not only misrepresents history, but it also black lists a particular ethnic group for a political purpose.On an end note, whether good or bad from either side, the truth should not be taken out of the film. If it is a historical film, it should be made as such. One such historical film from the region I would say is fair and balanced would be that of Ben Kingsley's 'Gandhi.' If the producer of this film wanted to show atrocities, he should have shown it as it was historically, including that from India and Sri Lankan forces. As for 'Madras Cafe,' it is far from the truth...",negative
Madras Cafe,"It took 3 films and 7 years for Shoorjit Sircar (director) to deliver us with undoubtedly the best political thriller we can savor ourselves over a long time. 'Madras Cafe' is unarguably a gem of a movie that belongs to a rare genre of Bollywood cinema and deserves much more attention and applause than what it's being receiving.The film is based on the backdrop of the Sri Lankan civil war in the late 1980's and early 1990's. It crosses its path with the plotting and execution of the then, Indian Prime Minster, whom we understandably can make out as Late Mr. Rajiv Gandhi. This film is so well crafted; it was not possible to find out a loophole in the entire plot.John Abraham (Producer), who plays as a RAW Officer has done a 100% justice to his character Vikram Singh. There are noticeable fluent and honest performances from Siddharth Basu and Nargis Fakhri (Rockstar) on the other hand as well. If you want to know more about what's inside, you have to go and watch it yourself. Although just do a bit of homework on the Lankan civil war events that occurred in the late 80's. You would not regret it.There was one drawback of the movie though. The movie had an end. But as they say 'All good things comes to an end'. So, I guess it to be that way.Madras Café is a slap on the faces of all the directors and also on the ignorant and bogged down movie goers who are ardent worshipers of senseless commercial cinema that has plagued Hindi movie industry over the last year and half. John Abraham here has to be appreciated immensely for the effort he has put in out of the movie, since; there was no one who was ready to produce this movie earlier until he accepted this project to invest in.Thank you John Abraham and Shoorjit Sircar.Without any second thoughts, being thankful and much obliged with this Intelligent and brave cinema,.. I'm going with an esteem ★★★★★★★★★✩ (9.1/10) for Shoorjit Sircar's Madras Café. This one is a Must Watch.Watch and BE ENLIGHTENED..Cheers",positive

Hes just only knows how to make blockbuster movies out of very very foolish stories (like the story of Mersal). It just has the worst story.

He proves his Oscar winning award in Mersal, songs such as Aalaporaan Thamizhan and Neethanae bring out the audience a real taste of Mersal!SJ Surya as a villain plays his role neatly (look out for his dialogues/scenes in the second half) a perfect suit for the movie - Stylish.Also, actors such as Vadivelu and Sathyaraj stand out not just for their comedy but for their highly rated emotional scenes which Atlee narrates well. Vadivelu fanatics will leave the cinema with smiles on their faces:)Heroines play their role superbly in each of Vijays Characters and so do other actors such as Sathyan, Kovai Sarala, Vikram Vedha's ""Cheta"" etc.GK Vishnu has fantastic cinematography for a debut, thanks to Atlee for giving him an opportunity to see how perfectly he can do his job! Visuals in Aalaporaan Thamizhan and Many of the magician scenes excel, thalapathy is captured spot on!Ruben the editor has done his job well, with neat cuts and editing to keep the movie at a smooth pace.What can I say, a pure Thalapathy Vijay entertainer with high emotional/ mass scenes which will impress the audience of all type. A film for thamizhans to enjoy, so worth the wait? TOTALLY YES, go grab your tickets and have a great Diwali ahead!9/10",positive
Good People,"I like James Franco a lot, however I have comes to terms with the fact that just because he is in a movie does not mean it is going to be a good movie. Fortunately with ""Good People"" that is not the case.Right from the get go the movie had my attention, it starts off very well and sets the mood for the rest of the movie. From there it gets a little slow but remains interesting. Then once things pick up again it is pretty entertaining.I find it hard to rate this movie too high since the story is generic and it doesn't really do any original or new. However it is still a very watchable and entertaining thriller.6.5/10",negative
Good People,"Hard to ignore some gaping mistakes in the plot:1. The lead character finds the money, but not the briefcase full of ""liquid O"" that is right behind it. He finds a box full of cash, but does not look in the ceiling again to see if there is more, or anything else up there?2. The thugs find the drugs in the apartment after the police have searched the apartment. The police, suspecting that there is a drug tie-in, never think to look in the drop-down ceiling?3. The couple is about to be evicted, and about to lose ""the house."" This means the house they are renting? Why not move into the house that he is fixing up and has inherited? It had a roof and walls, and he knows carpentry. No rent to pay if they move into the house, yes? 4. No one seems concerned that a police officer, or someone dressed as a police officer, shot a detective and continued shooting in a public park. Never mentioned on the news they listen to? Never brought up in any of the conversations among the characters?5. When nailing the thug to the floor, the lead male is somehow able to know exactly where both of his feet were positioned, although the floor is solid where he is standing, with none of the cracks that can be seen in other parts of the floor. 6. The same thug, hiding from people with guns, lights a cigarette, which might not seem wise, since smoke could be seen coming from the room where he is hiding, or smelled. But no one does see or smell it, including Khan, who walks right up to, and almost past, the room before being shot at.7. No one tries to put out the fire, which is confined to a small section of the house once the shooting has ended. And of course, the clichés were terrifying--the couple trying to have a child and learning at the end that they were going to have a child. The detective who has lost a child to drugs, and is now seeking to destroy the drug trade? Somehow, the obvious cliché was missed--this couple needed a dog. A dog, wounded in the battle with the drug dealers, but recovered by the end and leaping into their laps after the news that a child is on the way.

Raid,"The main problem with Raid is that from the trailer itself you know the whole story of the film and for the most part, it's a film that has been seen in Indian films way too many times. But the making is better than most of the previous iterations of the story in a way that it skips a lot of mandatory checkboxes and just barely satisfies some of them for a popular Bollywood film format for becoming a genre film. There are some very good moments in between too, but it soon becomes repetitive and there is no real tension because anyone can predict the next scene if they are familiar with some of the Indian political crome films and the film never tries anything new.",negative

The Admiral: Roaring Currents,"The fact check of the movie is completely off history. But it claims it is accurate. In actual battle, General Yi used the meticulous planning and strategy to defeat the enemy with minimal loss. The movie makes it seem like Yi wont it out of luck and courage.Actual events that are recorded in the historical document aren't even used. All turtle ships were destroyed in the previous battle but the movie wanted to make it dramatic... cheasy drama at that.Many historical records show that the Japanese fleet was 130 ships. Only one document recorded it as 300 out of mistake according to historians and the movie decided to go with that because 300 is more dramatic than 130 obviously.And there is no swirling tornado in the water. It was just fast current. The things the movie got wrong are countless. What's worse is that these fake dramas didn't make the story any more interesting. Actual history is far more interesting and dramatic.General Yi's actual battles and story is one of the most dramatic in world history. And this movie isn't it. This movie is a pure GARBAGE!",negative
The Admiral: Roaring Currents,"I am Korean and biased.In Korea, where I was growing up, Admiral Yi Sunshin was regarded someone omnipresent in everybody's life. He was not regarded as some kind of deity or a great hero. But he was regarded more like everyday household spirit (as a human). He is special in that way. He is not god, or legendary hero, but he is a person who is taking part of the greatest history of the Southern coastline. It is because he left a war diary that is ruthlessly plain and accurate and almost too dry. He was respected not only by his valour, great tactic, or special war hero characters, but he is so painfully plainly human who is sick all the time, folliwing rules, working so hard, minding other people with respect, and being practical, and tortured by his own people and yet did not give up such basic principles of life. He was respected for his personal quality and the 100% winning battle results was natural against Japanese Amadas.This movie does not depict much of his personal quality you can glimpse when you read books about him including his own diary. This movie fails to describe the people around that era and people right next to him in my opinion. Much has been altered in the modern Korean people's views. They had a totally different philosophy and view of the world then. The perception of China and Japan by Koreans were different from nowadays.What this movie succeeded in my opinion is that it for the first time tried to describe the particular battle of Myungryang with some good cinematic foundation. It is a bit corny and not perfect but overall, the battle was well studied and the combat scope was well depicted. Admiral Yi's war will be very hard to describe in pictures as he had extremely well pre-mediated plan/strategy before he engaged any sea battle. He was a perfectionist. So, it is hard to pick out all the critical elements he laied out playing his war game. He was a very serious and sophisticated person showing in military combats. So, it is not about a great hero with great anger and energy rampaging in enemy's territory with powerful fists.The movie is slow a bit and the plot is not perfect. With some errors incorporated, too. However, the battle scene itself, if you carefully watch, is interesting and the visuals are not too bad. Although, I would have preferred more CGI work.He used his life philosophy and principles in the battle ahead of weaponry and tactics. He did not give up and even with only 12 ships against over 300 ships, he made his best war strategy(not giving up again) and we can see the strategy there.It was perhaps the most amazing battle in human history and this movie manages to be close to show it. Not quite but almost. So, my score for the great effort to achieve almost impossible job.",positive
A Touch of Sin,"Nobody can deny that like all economic systems, ""Capitalism"" too is condemned time and again by filmmakers. What is important to note is that ""A Touch of Sin"" is the first serious attempt by a Chinese director to berate capitalism which is causing irreparable damages to Chinese nation especially to its ordinary population which is unable to figure out how to deal with money and its implications on a person's life. In all frankness, calling ""A Touch of Sin"" a feature-film would be a travesty of cinema as it is merely a well stitched collection of four different short films about ordinary people in China who have succumbed to pressures. Although it has been highly praised by media all over the world,this new film by Chinese director Jia Zhangke is utterly predictable and does not offer anything new. One wonders on what grounds was it selected for best screenplay prize at Cannes Film Festival 2013 ? When one leaves an independent form of filmmaking for more commercial style of filmmaking, weaknesses in the film are clearly evident. For example-There is an exaggerated scene involving a business man with a wad of currency notes who continually pummels a woman to prove his point that capitalism has not left any scope for human feelings.This scene could have used less violence but Jia Zhangke chose to dramatize it to such an extent that it became almost unbearable to watch.Lastly,this film is replete with numerous scenes of this type where ""too much"" is done in the name of sophistication at a time when ""too little"" could also have easily eased things for the film,the director and the viewers.",negative
A Touch of Sin,"I think people wrote reviews here don't actually know these 4 stories are all true stories and really happened in The modern Chinese society. The first character, Dahai, is a real serial killer,whose name is Wenhai Hu, killing 14 villiagers in Shanxi province in 2002. 
Second character, Xiaoyu, is a waitress in Hubei province and stabbed 3 local government officials. Her real name is Yujiao Deng, and she was acquitted of a charge after this scandal was brought up to the internet.
Third character, whose real name is Kehua Zhou, was another serial robber killing strangers and taking their bags. He was shot down by the police near his hometown.
The last character is a reflection of the suicided employees of Foxconn, the biggest manufacturer of IPhone. It was reported that from 2010 to 2012, there were several employees of Foxconn jumped off the roof due to the heavy workload and military-like management.

Ninja: Shadow of a Tear,".......To the late eighties and early nineties when direct to video action movies were big Business, and made household names of Van Damme, Seagal, Blanks, Rothrock and many more.Casey Bowmans life is shattered by a savage act of violence, when his wife is murdered. Vowing revenge, he tracks the killer to Rangoon with the help of a wise sensei. His only clues: a series of victims whose necks bear the distinctive mark of strangulation by barbed wire. Casey must sharpen his battle skills to the next level, as he must finally become an invisible warrior worthy of the name Ninja. But just when his prey is cornered, an unexpected twist shows Casey that his battle is only beginning: he truly can trust no one.....The first movie in my opinion was a load of old rubbish, the action was mundane, and it looked very bad. This is something else though, and Adkins has really stepped up a few gears since that movie. Assassination games, USol day of reckoning, Expendables 2 have really shown his skill, and this movie escalates that to another level.The movie is just Death Wish meets Commando by way of First Blood part 2, and the action is relentless from beginning to end.If you loved renting out American Kickboxer, or any film that ended with Kickboxer, claws, or Ninja in the title, then this will be for you.This could be the turning point for direct to DVD action movies.",negative
Ninja: Shadow of a Tear,"Saw this early at the Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas and it is quite possibly the greatest DTV action movie ever made.Though many would not be proud of it, but I am a DTV (direct to video) expert. I subject myself to watching pretty much every DTV action movie ever made. Though most of them are just absolutely awful, it is all worth it when a Unisol Regen or Blood and Bone comes along and blows you away.The main problems with dtv movies are: 1. Zero budget 2. Shaky cam/quick edits 3. Actors not willing to put in the work for the fight scenes to look realistic 4. Stupid plots with dumb romancesThough Ninja Shadow of a Tear is on a small budget, all of the aforementioned problems are fixed. The movie is completely without shaky cam and quick editing. The plot is very basic and there is no fat to try and make it anything other than what it is....an incredible action movie. And finally, the incredible Scott Adkins and the amazing stunt team put in some amazing fights.One scene in particular is Scott Adkins versus 6 guys in a dojo and the entire fight is filmed in one take with zero editing...like the Alphonso Cauron of DTV shots. It was absolutely amazing.Just an amazing fight movie that takes the best fight scenes ever and mixes it with Rambo, old Cannon movies from the 80's, and Enter the Dragon and other Asian flicks from the 70's. Just a perfect movie that looks like a big budget Hollywood flick. Not a single dollar was wasted and no goofy cgi or wires were used. I can't recommend this movie enough. The action is incredible and everything came together to make one of the best fight films of all- time. Hollywood, please wake up and give Adkins/Florentine a budget and I think you would be amazing at what they can do.If you are looking to check out other great DTV movies and save yourself the trouble of all the nonsense and garbage I have seen, check out the following. But most importantly, check out Ninja Shadow of a Tear when it is released. It is a definitely blu-ray buy for me.1. Universal Solider Regeneration 2. Ninja Shadow of a Tear 3. Blood and Bone 4. Undisputed 3 5. Wake of Death (pretty much all of the Van Dammes are watchable) 6. Undisputed 2 7. Universal Soldier Day of Reckoning (just watch the last 45 minutes)",positive
Wyrmwood: Road of the Dead,"WYRMWOOD is a high energy zombie flick from Australia that combines the road movie genre with a classic zombie apocalypse outbreak type horror yarn. It has a little of the verve of VERSUS but in the end I found it quite predictable and a little overwhelming.What's clear from the outset is that this is one step up from being an amateur film. The look of the zombies is cheap, especially with those Halloween party contact lenses, although there's copious gore to help make up for this. The acting is of a generally poor quality, but the film goes for a semi-serious approach so that doesn't matter too much.What WYRMWOOD does offer is action in spades. There's barely any plot, just a handful of characters battling both zombies and some sinister scientists bent on human experimentation. None of it made much sense to me, but the director works hard to infuse his film with vibrancy and momentum, and he does succeed in part.",negative

Rurouni Kenshin Part II: Kyoto Inferno,"The first live-action installment of Rurouni Kenshin judiciously cut several arcs from the original manga and anime story to deliver a tight, cohesive narrative that built up to a satisfying conclusion — even if it did reveal a few late-story secrets far, far too early. The first half of a two-part follow-up, Rurouni Kenshin: Kyoto Inferno (a.k.a. Kyoto Taika-hen) suffers by failing to take the same discretion with the source material, choosing instead to mirror the manga's episodic, drawn- out build-up to the decisive confrontation between Himura Kenshin (Takeru Sato, a former Kamen Rider) and Makoto Shishio (Tatsuya Fujiwara of Battle Royal and Deathnote fame). This film could easily have worked as a televised miniseries, with a sense of minor resolution every twenty minutes or so as a greater, unifying threat loomed in the background. But as a singular arc, Rurouni Kenshin: Kyoto Inferno lacks any cohesive build or pay-off as Kenshin wanders from one seemingly arbitrary encounter to the next. A plea for help. An assassinated official. A stolen sword. A village in peril. A search for a swordsmith. A plot to burn Kyoto. A desperate rescue. An open-ended conclusion. And between each burst of choreographed violence, a ream of static exposition that would nearly send George Lucas looking for an editor.The story partly suffers from its need to play clean-up to some first- film decisions. Hajime Saito (Yosuke Eguchi) has already been introduced as an unambiguous ally, and although he's allowed to display more badassery this time around, the film lacks the taut-wire tension between Kenshin and the ex-Shinsen Gumi leader that formed the backbone of the manga's sensational Kyoto arc (Saito's opening face-to-face with Shishio is also a bit silly, largely resembling an outtake from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom). The film also struggles to introduce Aoshi Shinomori (Yusuke Iseya, who was interesting in Casshern back in 2004). While wisely excluded from the first film — another semi-villain would have just been too much — cramming all of his development into an expository sub-story this time around fails to do justice to one of the series' most compelling characters. By the time he faces off with Kashiwazaki Nenji (Min Tanaka), the ostensible leader of the Oniwa Banshu ninja group (translated here as The Watchers), we really haven't had time to get to know him or care about his goals.One standout, however, is Tao Tsuchiya, who's delightful to watch as Oniwa Banshu ninja Makimachi Misao. While her attempts at anime-style spunk don't quite work, her full-throttle wire-assisted combat displaces enough bamboo to evoke positive memories of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Ryunosuke Kamiki (voice of Bo in Spirited Away and Marukuru in Howl's Moving Castle) similarly sets up an effectively creepy Sojiro Seta, though in a film crammed with so many new characters, we don't quite get to know who he is so much as simply what he does.As for the remainder of the supporting cast from the first film, they are almost entirely cut from the runtime, appearing only during Kenshin's should-I-go-to-Kyoto quandary at the opening and then again at the end. This leaves Kenshin meandering the middle arc as an arbitrary avenger, with only an incidental connection to the travesties Shishio creates around him — and repeated scenes of women and children weeping extravagantly over dead bodies feels more desperate than driving. With Sato's portrayal of Kenshin predominantly set to glower, we don't get a clear sense of the radical shift between his carefree and killer states, and it's unclear which moments truly resonate with the reformed assassin.The action sequences are exceptionally well-choreographed, and generally fun to watch. But with so many featuring hero-vs-the-world stuntman slaughter, tension is quickly lost. While there are fits of incidental action, there are only two big one-on-one fights for the title character, and the second, though Bourne-like in its innovative use of tight spaces, involves an antagonist we barely know and who only serves to mechanically set up the next plot point (He's also done up a little too ridiculously for a live-action villain — another area where deviation from the source material would have been wise). Taken on the whole, the film feels like watching only the first quarter of Kill Bill Volume 1 stretched to 139 minutes. Much sound and fury, signifying little — and even a citywide battle in the penultimate arc seems arbitrary and unearned. Having gone through so many unrelated minor objectives, the stakes are unclear and the emotional investment isn't there. Perhaps this will all be put paid in the second half, promised in September. But until then, this Rurouni Kenshin feels long on tease and short on delivery.(Disclosure: I got to play the first plummeting body in the video for One OK Rock's Mighty Long Fall, the film's closing theme.)",negative
Rurouni Kenshin Part II: Kyoto Inferno,"I am deeply surprised. I was expecting a really bad adaptation, as it has been done before. This movie however is great. If you grew up watching the anime you will be pleased, as it brings to life the right personality of the characters. They even have that goofiness Himura always showed whenever he was surrounded by the ones he loved. But shifting right back to some cold heart determined killer that awarded him his nickname. The fighting scenes, were tremendous. None of that ""shaking camera"" BS that Hollywood vomits on us. Really well done.The filming and editing are sublime. I could easily notice on one of the big fights (wont spoil it for you), the still burning ashes floating around the scene, giving me instant flashbacks to the anime. Really nice touch. And the opening scene of Shishio and Saito is tremendous.The action is great. Himura is perfectly portrayed, with all of his goofy nuances, deep honor, shame, guilt, and killer instinct. And the same can be said of the remaining characters. Sanosuke is as obnoxious and lovable as ever. And Sojiro is perfectly depicted in his psychopath childish assassin persona. I feel like i could show this movie to people that have never seen the anime, and they would still love it. Great work guys.",positive

Witching and Bitching,"This fast paced, Spanish film is simultaneously a really disturbing horror tale, a meditation on the battle of the sexes, and one of the funniest movies I've seen in years. Things get off to a lightning start with a holdup of a gold buying emporium in downtown Madrid by criminals posing as living statues with a critical assist provided by a ten year old accomplice, one of the wildest film heist scenes I've ever seen and worth the price of admission alone. Seriously, you'll never forget the sight of a gold painted Jesus sprinting for his life while toting a little kid who's shooting back two handed at the police.A beginning like that would be hard to surpass, but W&B continues to pile it on under Alex de la Iglesia's masterful direction. Having commandeered a cab whose driver willingly agrees to assist them, the criminals try to flee north to France to escape the law and to fulfill the promise made by the leader, José (Hugo Silva), to take his son to Disneyworld in Paris, with the police and José's divorced wife in hot pursuit. Already a tense situation for the hapless thieves, things take a decided turn for the weird and the worse when they reach the witch infested town of Zugarramurdi, in the heart of Basque country. Led by a three generation family (the oldest witch reminded me of Grandmama from the Addams Family), the witches capture the thieves with malign designs upon them, namely to use the men as sacrifices to restore an oppressive matriarchy.The pace rarely lets up and the jokes fly fast and furious, interspersed with over the top, gross out scenes of gore. The men lament their inability to get along with women only to find themselves trapped in a decaying mansion (is there any other kind in a horror movie?) by a bunch of smiling, evil, literal witches who want to torture, kill, and eat them. They fight back as best they can, but their fates ultimately depend upon the attraction felt by the youngest witch in the family (well played by the stunningly beautiful Carolina Bang) for bumbling José. The climactic scene of a Witches' Sabbath simply has to be seen to be believed, but I won't give away any spoilers.About the only real criticism I have of this film is the English title, which I don't think accurately conveys what the film's about. The Spanish title, Las Brujas De Zugarramurdi, The Witches Of Zugarramurdi, was apparently a non-starter due to the long, difficult Basque place name. This minor cavil aside, this was a crackerjack movie, absolutely entertaining from start to finish.I recommend this film to horror fans who don't mind comedy mixed in with the scares (some horror fans are big purists that way) and anybody who likes a good laugh in general, although I will provide the trigger warning that this is not for anyone with a weak stomach.",positive
Vada Chennai,"As the title reads, the characters in the movie also are complicated because of love. Love for the power, love for the people, love for status and love for money. And as the lead character name itself is Anbu(meaning love) how can his life be simpler. Part 1 is mainly focused on how 'Anbu' is dragged into the world of darkness. The Staging of scenes are done very realistically, which even more boost up the intensity of the film. Director does his best job by portraying the actual rawness of the place.Talking about the camera work for the first few minutes, the camera movement was very visible but later as film goes on, the camera movement becomes static which gives a essence of looking through the eye of the characters in the movie. The Beauty of the film is the action sequence, it is precisely choreographed. And talking about the background music, it just blends with visual. On whole the film is engaging with all the aspects of life, the love sequences of the film doesn't disturb the engaging narration, instead it makes it even more better, this is the best part of the film.
More than a film about gangster, it is film about life.
The cast of the film did their best work.

Vada Chennai,"This movie has been in the making for a decade or more and its totally worth it and understandable! Every character, scene, dialogue means something and its so well etched that you have to accept it sets a benchmark for regional cinema.
It is comparable to all the great gangster dramas that world has produced like the untouchables, godfather, and our own nayagan, satya and gangs of wasseypur. Amusing that directors find their best work in describing crime from its origin to effect.Yes, this movie describes a reluctant young man's journey through the slums surrounded by crooks eventually into a leader and ganglord and is inspired by all those movies listed above.
What stood out were few things among many, how the director has given attention to detail right from cinematography to dialogue to time period it feels as if the tale is unscripted, the superb acting from all the cast led by Dhanush, the editing which deserves multiple awards for carrying out non linear story telling with aplomb, the music which is not jarring and giea with the flow and above all the direction which is a cut above the rest taking the best out if his crew Vetri maaran gives his best work here.Enjoy the intensity, political satire (for eg when a character asks if rajiv gandhi succeeded mgr as prime minister) the lawlessness, the dilemma of who or what is right and wrong, is it all by design or free will and many other uncomfortable questions.You will definitely root for the lead character and have many moments with tears in your eyes and lump in your throat!",positive

I was not having a vehicle with me, I went with my family and I had to stay even after intermission. It is a hit just because of the cast and comedy ONLY.

Happy New Year,"What has happened to Bollywood? Directors such as Farah Khan bank on the star power of SRK/Deepika and other stars to earn rs300cr+ at the BO and what they deliver in return is a shitty/crappy/non sense/unfunny movie filled with slapstick humor, gay jokes, mediocre acting, ABS, and no logic whatsoever. I love to watch movie and I am myself a great fan of Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Manmohan Desai, their movies may not be completely logical but were entertaining and had emotions. But the joke is current directors are making high budget crappy movies with bland humor mentioning that its an inspiration to iconic directors of the past and making loads of money at the BO. I am sure HNY will be the highest grossing movie ever and Farah Khan will be one of the best director in Bollywood history, but me as an audience is left completely disappointed and cheated. HNY is the best heist movie ever since it is going the rob the Indian audience of their hard earned money in the name of entertainment.",positive
The Boy and the Beast,"Based on his wonderful films Wolf Children, The Girl Who Stepped Through Time, and Summer Wars, I've been thinking of Mamoru Hosoda as the heir apparent to Hayao Miyazaki, not because they're that stylistically similar but because both make beautiful, very human movies that give me joy. But The Boy and the Beast isn't anywhere near the level of his previous films.In premise alone, this film is far less interesting, falling into the clichéd reluctant-master-rebellious-student rut. Teacher teaches student, student teaches teacher, helpful sidekicks comment on the action, and it's all leading to the big fight.None of which is particularly bad, and the movie is perfectly enjoyable, but towards the end things go off the rails as a new storyline is awkwardly tossed in and a lot of new information is offered far too late in the game. It feels like two or three bits of movies were poorly welded together.Whether the reviews on IMDb are positive or negative, reviewers declare this beautifully animated, but while the animation is fine, there was little in it that was exceptional.Since Hosada's One Piece debut, every movie he has made was more wonderful than the one that preceded it. I can only hope that this is a stumble, not a fall, and that his next movie will be a return to his earlier brilliance.",negative
The Boy and the Beast,"Now with this movie finally getting an official release of course it has to open the same weekend as Zootopia (haven't seen but will review soon) which is killing the box office, while the Boy and the Beast had a total of 4 people in the theatre, two of which were me and my friend, and although I'm sure Zootopia is great, there needs to be love for this movie too! Japan is currently kicking anyones but in the animation department, and this film is nothing short of that, it looks beautiful almost every scene. The story it self is a simple one but the characters were so intriguing that it helped the story so much, basically a quick sum of the plot is there is a beast world and a human wanders into it to train with one of the beast, and as I mentioned I'm sure you are thinking that this is such an unoriginal plot, which in a way it is nothing new, but again you care about the characters so much that it throughly enhances the story, and the story actually has a great side plot. If you need something to watch this weekend I'm sure Zootopia is great for the family, but The Boy in The Beast is great for anyone, as it isn't too ""anime"" for the average person. Mamoru Hosoda really has quite a talent and with Miyazaki retiring I think he is going to cement himself as the best in animated films for years to come.So to sum things up definitely see the Boy and the Beast, it is a fantastic time age range: 10+ score: 10/10 would recommend to go watch",positive
The Dark Valley,"Pleasantly surprised to find an authentic Western rivaling Dances with Wolves and Eastwood in quality and ambiance. And, shockingly, it's a German production filmed in the Italian/Austrian Alps. The character presentations, props, sets, landscape, costuming, background sound effects and music were created, or reworked from existing structures, such that I could feel those rain drenched muddy roads on my feet as I watched. Bonus - action, suspense, storyline twists and emotional intensity. Landscape/scenery looked very much like the Rockies to me and I've traveled the Rockies from Canada nearly to Mexico.

So I simply had to give it a shot, after all it's an Austrian movie. So what I've come to find is that, as you watch the film, it gets more and more awe-inspiring. Sam Riley's performance is simply impeccable. The cinematography stunningly created, the shots simply gorgeous and even the soundtrack is genuinely amazing. Andreas Prohaska has created something I haven't seen in a while. Bottom line, I'd highly recommend the movie to everyone interested in something refreshingly original, an alps-western (even if I never thought this genre would even exist).",positive

Extraterrestrial,"This teeters on the edge of being a comedic IKWYDLS slasher/horror movie (with aliens in it) as opposed to a full-fledged UFO shocker. It has that commercialized ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" vibe and (intentionally?) comes across as totally over-the-top and cliché. It kicks off in that overplayed fashion, with the auto-tuned emo rock band playing in the SUV, as the college students go on a weekend getaway to their rich parents' cottage. You begin to expect absolutely no character depth and no intelligent dialogue (which is the way the director wanted it I guess). It does unfold in a corny kind of way but it has elements of awesomeness in it. The timing of the jump scares is really good. The moments of alien contact are really cool-looking. Even though it has an almost comedic atmosphere, it still manages to be scary. This is a decent horror movie, with good jump scares....so check it out. If...you can get past the anal probe jokes and corny characters.",negative
Extraterrestrial,"I saw a lot of negative reviews for this movie, and I just don't get it. I found it far superior to the garbage that Hollywood typically churns out. On a minuscule budget, The Vicious Brothers truly have come through with a frightening and atmospheric sci-fi horror movie. Once the aliens start popping up, there is a true feeling of paranoia and desperation in that log cabin as everyone tries to survive the night. Excellent performances from all of the young leads and a truly daring ending make this a must see. I'll take this movie over Sinister, A Haunting in Connecticut, etc. any day. I want to see more from these directors.....",positive
Bilal: A New Breed of Hero,"So you get 3 instead! Thank you Barajoun Entertainment for making up for the film's dryness on screen by introducing one of the most entertaining IMDb pages in a long time, Please don't stop!I do not wish to repeat what others have said about your magnificent PR campaign, not only in IMDb but also in your social network websites, but it does show sad desperation instead of letting the movie speak for itself and leave the judgement to the audience.I will bet my Kentucky horses that it's the same fellow with the same broken English with the same justifications here. At least change the method so it won't be that noticeable. Introduce unique plot twists and expressions.You think people don't know how easy it is to buy votes and reviews in international channels, good for you though, thankfully there were a few genuine and non bought reviews that unfortunately wiped the floor with the film. Just like the US presidential Campaign of 2016, a few dollars can go a long way in the media of a capitalistic world. Even they lost when it came to the people it seems.No wonder the story and the film turned up the way it did when you don't even have half of the imagination to write a few diverse reviews in these pages.",negative

Well voice overs for each character putting more life in them. its like introduction of the part of history.The movie is a fascinating glimpse into an important period in the history of the region, and the attention to detail paid to the costumes and backgrounds gives an authentic impression of the historical.

Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior,"When i watched this movie i found it entire commercial crap. Tanhaji was brave and loyal,and so was udhaybhan. Udhaybhan was not a cruel person and he was appointed by jaisingh, no relation between aurangzeb and udhaybhan. The people who watch this kind of historical crap they believe it and true history got lost. Nobody believes true history of tanhaji after this commercial crap. And shivaji maharaj never tried to keep secret of kondana from tanhaji he directly said that he could not come to raiba's marriage because he wants to win kondana fort. Nothing they showed about suryaji brother of tanhaji. After tanhaji dies suryaji leads the battle. Shivaji maharaj did not came in the battle when tanhaji was dying. After knowing that tanhaji was dead shivaji maharaj greived and named kondana as sinhagad and said that ""the fort is captured but lion is dead"". This movie don't deserve 8.4 rating.",negative

Fan,"After a long time, finally a SRK movie that propelled me to take some time out and write up a post.To begin with, FAN, by no means is a perfect and flawless movie (more on that later), but what the movie has successfully achieved is to unearth the untapped ACTOR out from the catacombs of mediocrity that has thus hindered the transition of THE STAR to an ACTOR.Director Maneesh Sharma, who also claims to be a big SRK fan himself, surely knows that the general audience wants to see more than rhythmic extension of arms from the MAN who once gave extremely nuanced and balanced portrayals in Swades and CDI. And hereby comes the movie FAN which can be any actor's dream role. From an uncouth and lovable Gaurav Chandana to a shrewd, realistic Aryan Khanna, it was hard to imagine that the same actor did play both the characters and that too with so much attention to detail. There are quite a few scenes that leaves you in awe of the exemplary display of Acting and makes you wonder ""where was this SRK hiding for so long?"" Kudos to the Director for taking this bold step of making the movie without any songs, heroines or as a matter of fact any comic scenes as well. It is just one man show from beginning to end laced with some superlative performance.Now coming to the flip side, at least for me, are the 3 exceptionally well designed and seemingly never-ending chase sequences which somewhat dilutes the impact. But again I see others really praising those sequences (so it depends on the taste I assume). Another glaringly noticeable point is the contrastingly different approaches to handle the 1st and 2nd halves. In the first half, the makers tried to keep the narrative as much close to reality as possible but in the 2nd half, Maneesh Sharma played it to the gallery where logic takes a backseat, but the sequences concerned are certainly thrilling and creepy enough to keep you glued to your seats.Lastly the climax which might receive extreme opinions, but I personally loved the ending.To conclude, this is not one of the best performance of SRK, rather his career best performance. And the movie might not earn big bucks because of its dark, grim and creepy undertones but will surely earn the love of moviegoers.",negative
Fan,"FAN is Shah Rukh Khan's best performance till date. His Aryan Khanna is Excellent but his Gaurav Chandana is better. This is the SRK I grew up watching. He can't really top this one. Kudos to the VFX and the prosthetic team for the make up. Maneesh Sharma's direction was brilliant. The story is different. The dialogues are very very good. Habib Faisal has done a good job with the dialogues. The costumes are dope for Gaurav . The editing is crisp and the screenplay is Fantastic. The movie has no songs(That was a bummer) The cinematography was exceptional, great locations. Since, the movie is completely focused on Aryan and Gaurav, the supporting cast don't have much to do. It's good seeing a movies like this is being made. Something different. It won't be a great success at the Box Office as it's a dark movie. The flaw what I found was the Special Effects in the first Chase Sequence- You'll notice it. Well one of the best movies SRK has ever acted in. 9ish/10",positive
Pawn Shop Chronicles,"Hadn't heard anything about this movie, or even known of its existence, until about an hour before I watched it tonight, lol. First off, for all you Norman Reedus fans: Even though he gets near top billing, You never see his face, and his screen time is like 2 minutes, so calm down for thinking you found a new Reedus film to be excited about, lol. (Don't you hate it when they do that :o/) This film's a good example of that scenario where the concept or premise of the film, its preview, and poster, make the film look really good, only to have the execution and/or the end of the film fall flat. High quality acting performances were given by the entire all star cast, Brandon Frasier especially, impressive as a lost, struggling, Elvis impersonator. There were some good, entertaining moments in the movie that gave me hope, but that's as far as it got. For every moment it seems like it was going to recover, it would fall again, including the ending, which was a let down, and, honestly, even for a movie of this genre, I felt the ending was in bad taste and crossed a line, as they tried to make humor of a man keeping women in captivity. VERY BAD timing, after what just went down in Ohio. You know how a movie can be so weird, but in a good way, or so weird in a bad way ? Well for me, this had both, but in the end, just left me feeling in a bad way. But, I say ""for me"", and rate this in the middle because, I'm sure there's going to be some of you sick pups out there that's going to think it was hilarious, while others will think it's just plain weird, in a bad way. 2.5 out of 5, or 5 out of 10 IMDb stars.",negative
Pawn Shop Chronicles,"Just discovered this movie and decided to watch as it is listed as a 'comedy'. And a very dark comedy it is! There are some really disturbingly funny scenes, but I found the balance of the film to be a sarcastically allegorical comment on life in America. Why the previous reviewers missed this is a surprise! Throughout the entire story director Wayne Kramer has offered to the viewer symbolic remarks on religion, politics, and economic life in the American laboring society.First we see the pawn shop - in America everything is a commodity that can be sold and bought - nothing has real value and value is always marginalized when the seller is in 'need'.Second Kramer offers the three rednecks who, on the surface are religious, in symbols only, and have no idea why 'they believe' because they are too consumed with destructive self indulgence. Then when Vernon is left for dead a 'savior' appears not to save him but to offer the chance for revenge. In America it's just believing that makes religion true, not understanding and living it.Third Richard discovers 'the ring' in the pawn shop and seeks answers as to how it got there. Kramer again shows us how property is valued in the social order. Material things along with humans are gifts for capitalist overlords. Shaw represents the ownership society. And when they offer favors to the 'working class' they are to be obedient and grateful, as seen with the caged women for Shaw's pleasure and the 'number one' caged girl who refuses to leave because she gets 30 minutes of television a week in 'the house'. Richard is the liberator and freedom fighter that American's always reject and destroy.Fourth Kramer gives us Ricky, the fourth rate Elvis impersonator, and here Kramer sums up the movie. Americans want to be 'a star' but few have that kind of talent outside of being a big fish in a small pond. And thats where Ricky finds himself. His image is compelling to the locals in that unnamed small southern town and they willing follow him around! Ricky wants a barber to even his sideburns and must choose between two identical barber shops. Kramer smartly symbolizes the American political system here as there is no real difference between the two leading parties (Democrats & Republicans). But the locals think there is a difference between the two barber shops and when Ricky picks one over the other mayhem erupts in the street. In America perception is what drives the choices. When the choice really doesn't exist! When Ricky gets to perform at the carnival he is so unprepared and untalented the locals reject him. Then when he accepts the offer made by the street preacher (Mephistopheles type character), Ricky's whole image changes when he starts singing 'Amazing Grace'. Suddenly the local towns folk see him as bright and talented because he has accepted their Christian values. Then the naked and filth covered cage women show up and wrap themselves in the American flag. The image of justice and freedom shine as long as Americans have patriotism and God. Shaw returns from the dead to claim the filth covered women and a new woman. They all follow him out. The locals are too star struck to notice what's happening right before them. Kramer shows how Americans cannot escape the capitalist system (Shaw) because society will always give into religion, patriotism and those who control the money.The film closes with Harry (little man/big truck) entering the pawn shop to teach Alton a lesson but JJ quells him easily and then it's business as usual for Alton. Harry is the collective conscience of America and it's small and easy to overlook, but it's always there.Pawn Shop Chronicles is a triumph for Kramer - it's perfection start to finish!",positive
Udta Punjab,"This movie involves every effort which makes a film perfect – Action, Emotion, Drama, Suspense, Investigation, Love, and Hate. Should be the movie of the year.

And Kareena Kapoor was flawless as always. But Alia's performance in this film was outstanding. Yes, you can say that, this was the best role of her career so far. And to Shahid Kapoor, ""kya gaali detey ho yaar."" Hats off to the makers. While dealing with an important issue like drugs, the story, never bores you. 'Udta Punjab' is filled with abuses, because that's what they are trying to show us. It need guts to do such kind of movie.

Detective Byomkesh Bakshy!,"Is the movie watchable? Perhaps to a degree, until the climax.I give it 2 stars, 1 for art direction and another for the actors.With the exception of Swastika, acting is generally good. Even supporting actors do their part pretty well. Talking about supporting actors, there is a certain Japanese gentleman who looks and acts his part very well. But here's what goes wrong. His character, Dr. Watanabe, a practicing Japanese dentist, language teacher and samurai swordsman all rolled into one (not to mention being a Japanese secret agent) has one great flaw. That is he shouldn't have been there at all. His presence in Calcutta as a free man would be next to impossible in Calcutta in 1943, a time when the Allies where already in war with Japan. As soon as war was declared, he would have been arrested and sent to one of the many internment camps that detained enemy nationals like Germans or Italians. Remember 7 years in Tibet? Brad Pitt, a German national finds himself in an internment camp in British India from where he escapes to Tibet. The plot might have been saved if he was disguised as a Chinese or Korean doctor, or if he laid low in some other way. But what can we say, it's a creative reinterpretation and Bollywood hype nowadays use words like ""creativity"" in combination with ""well - researched"" to the an increasingly discerning audience hungry for new, read better quality cinema.1943 was also the year of the Bengal Famine. Various causes including food stocks being used up to feed soldiers resulted in a Holocaust. Thousands from the country side flocked to the city to beg for food and people died by hundreds on the streets from malnourishment and disease. Yet there was no evidence of any of it neither in the outdoor street scenes nor in the screenplay. Such a major event going all around and there's not a single mention of it? It's like a typhoon blowing around you and all you can talk about is what curtains will suit the window, or more interesting, who stole the curtain. To top it in the streets, there are vendors selling loads of green produce and the fish vendor shouting out how fresh the fish is. One wonders how much research really went into it writing the script. Surely much less than the hard work of the CG team.The aim is to make an entertaining movie, isn't it? But the public also demands good entertainment which includes well written plot not full of holes and inaccuracies especially when the hype was all about being so accurate in terms of recreating the period. Art direction is not everything. You can make a pretty convincing picture of the past but if the story has obvious flaws, it's a disaster.For the less discerning who don't care about their intelligence being insulted, get your bag of popcorns and (re)watch the film till the very end. That is if you can digest the ending sequences where the slo-mo blood bath and hackneyed Chinese torture takes place. It's not even funny.",negative
Detective Byomkesh Bakshy!,"Everything is amazing in the movie, the set especially. It is very scripted and screen written. Director Dibaker Banarjee has proved that he is in class of pure elite film-makers like Raju Hirani,Anurag Kashyap,Neeraj Pandey etc. It is set in 1942 with a loose connection to World war II. In short, it is all brilliantly put. The antagonist of the movie is more powerful than the protagonist. this gives another spark to the movie. Every scene is interconnected with each other which makes this mystery tale perfect. There is not a single scene about the movie which you can say is unnecessarily put into it. The only thing which could have been better is that the actors could have performed better. Sushant did all he could but that was like his 3rd film so he is not to blame and all the other actors aren't famous. Just because few people who have zero knowledge of movie have given negative reviews about it doesn't mean that movie isn't good. Anyone who loves sherlock is going to love this movie too. Its not a movie to miss guys. And its sad the movies like kick, dhoom3 and chennai express do all the business only because of big names while good movies like DBB don't get the business they deserve. Its a pure delight for mystery lovers.",positive
Krrish 3,"Literally, each and every character, most of the action scenes, and dialogs in the film are inspired, or say blatantly copied from the Hollywood superhero films. X Men, Batman, Superman.. You name a comic hero, you got him in this film. Even the background score is lifted from Inception and The Dark Knight. And the worst part is that this plagiarism didn't pay off in the end. The screenplay was very poor. Action sequences looked too much fabricated, super slow, and lacked depth. It's a congery of B-grade visual effects, melodrama, and toothless humor.Final word: If you're are an eleven year old with no Hollywood experience, it's a treat for you. Or else, don't bother watching it.",negative
Krrish 3,"Just watched the movie. I think this movie is the first step of bollywood in making superhero movies. Hrithik roshan was fabulous in three different roles. He was childish as rohit,sweet&cute as krishna and menacing as krrish. I was moved when rohit died. Because rohit mehra was one of my favorite character which was portrayed by hrithik. Finally, it is good family entertainer. But it lacks somewhere to attract the youth. Kangana Ranaut was superb as Kaya. Vivek oberio was also good as Kaal. It could have been a better movie. Another drawback is that it has inspired by x-men,superman. Which questions the originality of the characters in the movie.",positive
Baby,"If you are a Ek tha tiger, Dhoom 3, HNY, Bang Bang fanboy/girl, do not watch this movie and do not read this review either, it's just not for you. Akshay Kumar do not need to romance hot girls, do not need to dance and sing, do not need to do melodrama to deliver a hit movie, he had shown us this back in Special 26, he has done the same here in Baby. The cast is a perfect one and there are no flaws.MOVIE: It has everything a good espionage thriller need to have- 1. Good cop bad cop routine 2. Cute chick beating the pulp out of the bad guy 3. Super cool combat scenes 4. No unnecessary sentiments and drama 5. Some brilliant dialogues 6. few laugh out loud scenes 7.

Cool Spy v/s bad guys 10. funny Akshay Anupam Kher duoOn negatives: Yes even i think the movie was a bit lengthy, if the director had trimmed it 10-15 minutes it would had been great. Yet, this movie is a rare feat. Bollywood rarely delivers movies like this. Its a must watch if you like sensible movies. And regarding the negative reviews, just do not pay any heed to them, for THIS GEM IS NOT TO BE MISSED. Neeraj Pandey as a director has done a brilliant job.",negative
Baby,"Though I don't categorize movies on the basis of their region or country, I had mentioned this title regarding India being proud of this movie. This is because I have heard people yelling in social media and in public about the low standards of Indian movies specially thrillers which either lack thrill or are copied from Hollywood. I agree to them o most occasions but this one. And I would strongly recommend people who complain about the lack of good movies in Bollywood to go and watch it. Or else stop complaining these craps.Coming on to the movie, it describes the biggest agenda world is facing right now, i.e, Terrorism, in best way it could. The story comprises of many small incidents which are bound together so slickly that we feel the smooth flow of script. We are lost in the hustle going on in front of us and are keen to know what is coming next. First half makes the plot for the movie and the second half unleashes the execution. Each and every scenes complements its predecessor and we are biting our nails without even noticing it. Last hour is full of thrilling actions and grueling proceedings.Talking about the acting , I must say Akshay Kumar has delivered a role of his life very convincingly. He lives his character and puts that extra amount of thrill via his superb action. Danny plays his role quite brilliantly. Anupam, Tapsee, Kay Kay and other supporting casts act life to their characters and make this movie a combo of power packed performances.Director Neeraj Pandey has already made a Wednesday and Sp 26 in past and thats why there was a very little scope for improvement for him. But I would be lying if i don't say that this is a notch higher that his earlier masterpieces. Editing is quite crisp. Screenplay is the soul of this movie while BM is equally engaging. Cinematography is grand and deserve applause. Dialogues are apt and support the movie a lot. Music is average and rightly so. Choreography is nil while action is breathtaking.It has a few flaws here and there in a few scenes but those are hardly noticed due to the fast paced drama and screenplay.Overall, a standing ovation for Neeraj and Akshay to give us Indians a movie to feel proud of. It can easily go into books as one of the best Hindi movies.A movie of Hollywood standard and execution. And who knows Akshay might get a shot at his dream of wining a National Award. I won't be surprised if he gets one along with Neeraj Pandey. It also has a potential to be India's official Oscar entry next year.I have rated this movie comparing it to other Indian movies...otherwise I would universally give it a 9 or 9.5.",positive
Reign of the Supermen,"Hated it! Hated it! Hated it!
The original writers of this story (Dan Jurgens, Karl Kesel, Jerry Ordway, Louise Simonson & Roger Stern) should be pissed. DC butchered this completely. I expected so much more and was sadly disappointed.
The original Death & Return of Superman (back in 1992 &'93) was one of the best Superman stories I have ever read and this paled in comparison. They ruined the story, they ruined the original villain (who was a GREAT villain who would never do someone else bidding) and turned him into an underling. Then they used lazy writing to add a new villain that had absolutely nothing to due with the source material.
I thought they had learned something from their 1st attempt at this with Superman/ Doomsday dvd in 2007 but I guess I was wrong.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!!!
I encourage anyone who wants a great Superman story to find the original story in the Return of Superman trade paperback or the novel The Death & Life of Superman by Roger Stern (the novel does include the battle with Doomsday). Both are incredible. It might take you a little longer to read it but it will be worth it.",negative

Getaway,"A late night car chase through the cosmopolitan streets of Sofia, Bulgaria; throbbing with that distinct and exotic coolness European cities exude when darkness falls... it's an idea that could have been executed very well. Unfortunately not in the case of Getaway, which instead slaughters the idea so poorly you can't help but feel sorry for it. Everyone loves a good car chase. You won't find one in Getaway though. All the chase scenes are nothing more than a nauseating rapid succession of very brief cuts. It's literally   impossible to get a wider picture and understanding of what is going. Many scenes could have been quite impressive if they had just been shot at a wider angle and held a longer frame. This does not happen once though. The breakneck speed at which the cuts are made (close up of car headlights-exploding box-back wheel-driver-back to headlights) just doesn't allow the chase to flow and is frustrating to watch. How can one appreciate what's happening when they can't even see what's happening?Selena Gomez may be trying to break out of her Disney image (and good for her) but that doesn't mean she's suited to every role. Her performance here feels weak and definitely isn't helped by an even weaker dialogue. Ethan Hawke's performance is more believable, but it's only one taste bud of sweetness in the overall bad taste this movie leaves. There's pretty much zero laughs, the first half is filled with the characters bickering annoyingly, the chase scenes are visually unwatchable, it's painfully unnecessarily noisy and the plot is nothing but mediocre. Fortunately I viewed the film at an advance screening and therefore given it was free I just felt disappointed, rather than feeling ripped off as I would have had I actually handed over my hard earned dollars in exchange for that mess. I tried my best to enjoy the film, but to be honest all I wanted to do was getaway.",negative
Getaway,"GETAWAY (2013) 0 stars Ethan Hawke, Selena Gomez, Jon Voight, Rebecca Budig. Epically ridiculous action thriller with Hawke (dialing in his performance flatly for a quick paycheck) as a washed-up professional race car driver finding himself forced to steal a muscle car for an unknown kidnapper (Voight, shot only in extreme close ups of his jowls; ditto) who has his wife hostage and a time clock ticking. Gomez is the unlikely owner of the super up automobile who is along for the ride and arguably the most laughable 'techie nerd' ever (!) Courtney Solomon's excuse for a movie is simply to show a shiny toy speed really fast and a ton of police cars paying homage to any other action film with an unending loop of a 'chase'. Easily the worst film of the year; heed the titular warning - I wish I did.",positive
Sultan,I do not see movies of Salman Khan and other khans (... except Irfan Khan) but was forced to see this movie with family. I would say Salman still struggles to perform and act after so many years. Story and plot was awful too. Total waste of money. However the main actress and other actors acting was superb and will help relieve the pain you are getting while watching this movie. I have kept myself far from khan's movies in general for so many years (Irfan khan is an exception) and I think its the right decision. Public watch these movies for time pass. There are other really good Indian movies being produced every day. And I would prefer to watch those in my precious time.,negative
Sultan,"I found myself really enjoying SULTAN. Ali knows how to push all the right buttons to keep the audience engaged. Ali's writing and directing are flawless. This is without a doubt Ali's best ever movie. Nushki is an acting diva and she is making her way to be the next great actress since Aishwarya Rai. I love love love Nushki, I truly adore her and always will. She's my love ;) xxx I must confess that I could watch Nushki in almost anything, but here she really delivers a performance that may be her best yet . . . and I've seen almost all of her work. Nushki elevates herself to a league of her own. She is a beautiful girl who is talented enough when playing ""regular"" characters, such as the journalist in ""PK"". But as a high profile corporate executive in ""NH10"" and in this film as a musclebound wrestler, she takes it to a level most female actors couldn't. You can tell how hard she worked to make this role believable because when she wrestles you forget it is Anushka Sharma in the ring. SK is always a pleasure to watch. Here his character's sizzling chemistry with Nushki is completely adorable and that moments of sweetness will surely MELT your heart. SK gives an incredible performance that will undoubtedly propel his career. Overall it is one motion picture that should never be missed nor put aside when selecting movies to be seen on a weekend. SULTAN is a sure winner for all.",positive

The Bag Man,"Preamble; I love movies of all genres from The Princess Bride to Total Recall with side-trips through the classics and British Comedies. That being said, this is perhaps the worst movie I've seen to which actors of this caliber have been attached. This is Grovic's first directorial attempt, and he has yet to develop a sense of tone, story-telling, etc... This movie is a mish-mash of other stories pasted together with no commitment to it being a comedy, gritty suspense story, visceral murder and mayhem fest or spoof. It's a mystery, to me, why these very talented actors made this movie. Are they friends or relatives of the director? Did he have a colossal budget to pay them? Was the script great and then thrown out during the process of making the movie? Beats me. I rented from a Red Box and I feel cheated at $1.20 Sorry for being so harsh about this film, but when proved actors whom I regularly pay theater prices to see work make a movie like this it's jarring to my artistic sensibility. Better luck next time.",negative
The Bag Man,"I usually watch movies based on their high IMDb scores, but movies like ""The Bag Man"" are why I sometimes dip down into the 5's and 6's. At first I was surprised to see so many reviewers call it ""boring"", ""bad"" and ""nonsensical"", but then I realized that this film just isn't for everybody, but for some--like me--it's riveting. Almost the entire movie takes place during one night at a roadside hotel, where our protagonist, a contract killer (Cusack), is meant to go with a package and wait for pickup. Only everything and everyone around him seem to be set against him. The characters he meets and adventures he has there are fascinating, quirky, and surreal. The best way I can describe it is as a mix between ""Identity"", ""Mulholland Dr."", and The Book of Genesis.I think this movie has gotten so many bad reviews because it doesn't fit the mold. It defies expectations, and some people won't like that. But if you're looking for something different, something that can surprise you, watch ""The Bag Man"". And try to vanquish your expectations.Special props to Crispin Glover for portraying the hilariously strange Ned. My favorite character!",positive

Raees,"Finally the day arrived after 3 years if wait, the day arrived. RAEES . Miyan Bhai SRK stole the thunder with his power packed performance. He has nailed it this  time. Raees SRK has shown and proved "" Form is temporary, Class is permanent "" Shah Rukh Khan and Nawazuddin 's bravura performances, Action sequences, Well researched script, Music, Screenplay , Editing, and Climax. The first half is well placed; Majmudar's one liners and the music is fabulous and the Laila Main Laila sequence ups the ante. The second grips the audience in their seats and the smoke scene is the show stealer. The dialogues are just bang on.WOW ! The part where SRK says ""dhanda Karta hun, dharm ka dhanda nai karta"" is the best one.It's tough to maintain a character's ferocity and vulnerability in equal measures, but this is what SRK does best. Full of tightly-choreographed action sequences and a brilliantly written script, On the whole , Raees is a full on Masala Entertainer packed by power full performances and adrenaline charged action sequences. Made for Classes and masses alike. Action , Acting, Romance, Violence, Music and Masaledar dialogues all add up to the genre. A classic masala flick, Best movie of it's genre. A must watch movie. So my rating 10/10 Stars.",positive
Resident Evil: Vendetta,"Boring, predictable, shallow, over the top, ridiculous. The worst animated movie of the series, as bad as Anderson's movies. The only good thing is the impressive CGI, animations and details are really incredible. The rest is totally pointless. Basic plot line, one dimensional characters, absurd and not realistic situations. Plot is the same story told over and over again over the games: new villain spreads a virus, heroes fight zombies, heroes fight a final boss and save the city. There is absolutely no twist or a new focus on story that could make it more interesting.Only recommended for Resident Evil hardcore fans, casual viewers be warned: this is a total waste of time.",negative
Resident Evil: Vendetta,"I went to the one night only premiere of Resident Evil: Vendetta tonight the third C.G.I. motion picture movie of Resident Evil and I can honestly say is the best of the three.The movie deliver in more ways than one that fans of the Resident Evil series will super appreciate.First off we got to talk about how amazing the movie looks this is some of the most Phenomenal animation works I ever saw the characters and environments are so realistic that you can often forget that you're watching a Computer Generated Animated Movie the movie crew hired actors for motion capture to show case how real the characters look and move on screen they all deserve points for doing such a great job to make the movie look so great.The voice acting is top notch with in my opinion the voice work and characters Chris Redfield (Voiced by Kevin Dorman) Rebecca Chambers (Voiced by Erin Cahill) Leon S.Kennedy (Voiced by Matthew Mercer) Glenn Arias (Voiced by John DeMita)bringing great performances that really shows amazing work it makes you feel like you really watching a drama play done so well the voice work the cast does is so well done with the writing being very smart the writers took their time that's for sure.The story really is powerful throughout with the writing again being well through out. The cast performances also helps the story makes you draw into the plot to wonder what will happen next.The action in the movie is awesome it felt like you're playing the game and the effects are impressive barely enough time to rest as the action keeps you on the edge of your seat as you wait to see what goes on next.The only thing this movie needs is a mic drop because it really show why Resident Evil has had such a success the movie is made for fans of movies and Resident Evil. I will no doubt be glad to watch this movie over and over again.With amazing C.G.I Animation,Excellent Voice acting, Strong powerful story and action that leaves your jaw drop you really will love this movie.I give Resident Evil: Vendetta an 10 out of 10",positive

Badlapur,Movie Has No story Line.First Half Is Very Uninteresting And The Scenes Don't Link With each other. second half left every thing too apathetic. On the other hand movie struggles to make any sort of sense.Acting Of Varun Dhawan and Nawaz makes the movie bearable but the movie still isn't backed up by no story line. this movie tries to show a psycho-path but instead makes him a stupid unrealistic personality. watch the movie if you want to just watch a movie for the heck of it. believe me you won't regret not watching this movie. I will give a thumbs down to this movie. and only thing good in this movie is ActingI would not recommend this movie to any one except for Varun Fans as you may watch him in a new Avataar,negative
Badlapur,"From the first moment you set your eyes on the movie, you know that it's going to be highly stylish one. And it is! Not your Once Upon a Time in Mumbai sort of stylish. Rather stylish in truer and grittier sense.The characters were just fabulous. You don't know whom to call the victim and whom the culprit. Just an unfortunate event that sets off a chain reaction transforming every one in the process for the good or worse.The charms of the movie: Varun and Nawazuddin. The one I liked more was Varun for a very simple reason. Nawazuddin is an acclaimed actor though underrated. It's Varun who broke the stereotype chocolate boy image and got onto a new avatar. One that's disturbing and at the same time interesting. The only thing is, Varun's voice seemed childish in some scenes that demanded more impact. Other than that, Varun has my respect. Nawazuddin is Nawazuddin. I watch his every movie just to see him in action. Enough Said! The twists and turns in this movie seemed natural. Never forced. Unlike other bollywood movies, where the twists are introduced out of nowhere, this one had twists that baffled me with it's sheer brilliance. The gore is limited to just few minutes but enough to make a huge impact.The comedy is unintentional yet brilliant. The dialogues are not intended to make you laugh. But you laugh anyway. Even after the movie has ended. WOW! 2015 has been so good this far. Hope this continues for the rest of the year. Ugly, Baby, and now this.I'll not urge you to watch this movie if you like masala movies Or, if you intend to watch a family movie. But, if you want a taste of the nastier grittier stuff bollywood has to offer, I can't think of a better movie right now than this one.You'll either love this movie. Or, hate it. But this movie will definitely make an impact on you. That fer sure.",positive
They Call Me Jeeg,"Plain awful. Do anything else, throw marshmallows at stray dogs, pinch wallets, try to pee in a beer can, sell your body in parts. Anything is better than watching a badly acted and awfully written Kick-Ass/Hancock clone. Terrible B movie. At least Kick-Ass was funny and ironic, Hancock had great special effects, this dough is even trying to be dramatic. The only character building up throughout the movie is the loony girl, and she gets killed for no reason whatsoever. Her acting is dreadful (apparently she comes from a TV reality show), but her character is the only element of interest in the movie. Santamaria is just as wooden as Pinocchio. After she dies anybody else might as well turn into flaming zombies and bite everyone, you wouldn't give a rat's behind, anyway. The wooden puppet playing the bad guy should have been court martialed for his insanely bad acting. Steer clear, it is awful.",negative
They Call Me Jeeg,"A very good film, not afraid of showing on the screen the ugly people we are. This looked like a real National product to me, devoid of major foreign influences: it recalled much more of Pasolini's suburbs or of Pazienza's bad boys than of Deadpool or Kick-Ass. Which is something I liked very much.A catching opening scene, a solid plot, some very good actors and a great villain (Fabbio: Luca Marinelli won a David for this performance) will make you overlook some lack of craftsmanship in special effects or in action scenes.And originality is priceless. So sometimes is good to diverge from International main stream, I guess. Enjoy.",positive
Saaho,"Saaho...! There are so many problems with this movie that I don't even know where to start. There were so many times throughout the film where I wanted to laugh at how stupid everything was. That is how hilariously bad this movie is.I don't think there is any point trying to explain the storyline of this movie because it barely exists. The movie thinks it's so clever when it tries to wrap up everything at the end but without any logical sense, it comes across as painfully silly.There were so many things happening but nothing kept me invested or compelled throughout its 3 hour runtime. I really don't know what was going through writer-director Sujeeth's head because he failed to even get the basics right. The dialogues written were just cheesy one-liners that made me want to facepalm every time I heard one. The jokes were nowhere near funny. This movie itself is a giant joke.The writing is vastly incompetent. There barely was any character development from anyone. Shraddha Kapoor's character had some development but it wasn't enough for me to care about her. Prabhas's character unfolded literally at the end of the film but there was so much trash from the previous 2 hours 40 minutes that I just didn't care anymore. The only thought I had was to get up and leave. The gangsters portrayed didn't seem menacing at all because we don't learn much about them. Chunky Panday did feel threatening but he wasn't given anything to work with so he was just wasted.The acting was okay. No one really stood out to me since everyone was wasted potential. I thought the chemistry between Shraddha Kapoor and Prabhas was very unconvincing and dragged the film a lot.I kept on noticing how atrocious the editing was. To me, the background score was immensely obnoxious. This film takes itself so seriously and the loud score makes even more dramatic. The songs didn't do anything for the film's 'story' so in the end they were just unnecessary.Another thought that crossed my mind was ""Where did all of the money go?"". With a budget that high, you at least expect the film to look really good. The special effects are laughably bad. There is a scene involving a snake and the snake looks really fake. Parts of the action scenes seem very unbelievable because of the effects and how illogical they are. The scenery in the songs are nice to look at but they are irrelevant to the actual narrative.Saaho is one of the biggest disappointments of 2019. Pretty much everything in this movie is flawed. You ask for logic and don't get any of that. I just wish they wrote a better story with fleshed out characters so that we have something worth watching. Saaho is all style and no substance.",negative

Welcome to the Jungle,"Very bad modern parody of a great book: ""Lord of the flies"". Don't even worth to be seen for free... Lets say that Van Damme character is Simon (not a nice Simon as in the book but...); Adam Brody is Ralph and Rob Huebel is Jack. Also, Kristen Schaal is Piggy and Aaron Takahash Roger. Kristopher Van Varenberg could be the twins... who knows... Out of the Island, Phil (Huebel) is Chris (Brody)'s boss. He's an abusive boss, seconded by his right hand, Troy (Takahash). As the manager of the company feels his employees are not team players, he send them to an island to bond. The plane lands, the pilot dies and a very boring parody of ""Lord of the flies"" begins... It's not funny, it's not entertaining, it's just a waste of time.",negative
Welcome to the Jungle,"I thought this movie was really funny. The jokes and dialog was great (I actually did laugh through the whole show) and overall it was just an enjoyable escape. I thought all the actors did a great job, but I especially loved seeing JCVD do something different. Turns out, he's a pretty funny guy. I guess if you were expecting him to throw out a few karate kicks, that might be a let down. But I walked in just hoping to be entertained, and I definitely was. I don't watch that many comedies, so when I see one I like to laugh, not walk away more depressed than when I sat down. I wish more comedies were like this, because I would probably see more of them.",positive
Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead,"This movie is (like part 1 before) really something else. Goofy, gory, funny, disgusting, ""politically incorrect"" slaughterhouse with excellent FX and a touch of Monty Python. Absurd at its best. Obviously, this could be filmed only in Europe (despite some American actors), in a country an abundance of sense of humor (like Norway in this case). This is also a rare occasion where the sequel is even better than the first part (and leaves room for more; looking forward to it). I mean, zombie movie cannot be fun if it is not really funny and entertaining (both for crew involved and the viewers). The director knows very well that the whole ""zombie thing"" is ridiculous and absurd in itself and takes such approach. No one should take this seriously (simply disregard ""historic"" part) and it does not insult viewers' intelligence. Just enjoy. Of course, if you missed part 1, don't miss it. Watch both one after another. Highly recommended.",negative
Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead,"Everything in zombie movies has been done to death (see what I did there?). And yet, here comes a movie that actually adds to the genre whilst simultaneously disgusting me and making me belly laugh. And not one of those infectious belly laughs. You know, when you are in a theatre and something mildly amusing on-screen sends a ripple through the crowd which grows; mostly because the girl down the front has a weird cackling laugh that morphs into a full-on snort fest, and that just sets everyone else off. Yeah, well, it's not like that.I was on my own. And I laughed out loud multiple times. I genuinely LOLed. That's as rare as rocking horse faeces. Dead Snow 1 was a revelation; a brilliant twist on the genre. Dead Snow 2 adds again. The comedy elements are ratcheted up as is the budget. A budget wisely spent on special effects and sheer scale. If you are after genuine chills and insights into the human condition, Dead Snow 2 will leave you cold (see what I did there too?). But if your appetite runs to comedic gore in the vein of Peter Jackson's 'Brain Dead', you will love this one.",positive
Journey to the West,"Warning: Spoilers This movie is a disaster with its horribly random script, flat characters, terrible CGI, and an unbelievable romance.So let's talk SCRIPT. This should be easy, because there isn't one. The story follows the exploits of a young demon hunter as he hunts down three demons: water and pig demon, and the Monkey King. There is no set up to each encounter as the title character Xuan Zang tends to show up out of the blue, do battle, fail, and get saved by a better demon hunter Miss Duan. That's how each fight transpires from start to finish over the course of a 2 hour movie. We never really learn much about the title characters or a handful of minor characters who randomly appear and disappear. The whole movie and the threat of these demons is just glossed over for special effect and battle pieces that get rather boring by the end of the film.Xuan Zang is the lead—a demon hunter who believes in reforming demons rather than killing them, but we never learn why. There are no flashbacks or character development to lead us to understand why he thinks so differently about the monsters. He's a typical Chow innocent, almost exactly like Chow's character in a dozen of his previous movies. He is horrible at what he does until the end when he finally rises to the occasion.Second central character is Miss Duan (the love interest). She appears to help him out against the water demon and then appears out of nowhere when he tries to fight the pig demon. All we know about her is that she isn't an innocent as she kills whoever steps in her path and doesn't know how to flirt or express herself without using her fist. She travels the world with her sister and a couple hired goons that we only see once in a prolonged sequence in the middle of the movie. Like everyone else in this movie we never learn enough about them to care.I understand this is a comedy/action/fantasy movie, but enough character background and development has to be done for us to root for them and sadly, there wasn't. When people start to die at the end—you don't care.The CGI is laughably bad. I'll be honest, during the sequence with the water demon (by far the best part of the whole film) the effects looked great. The water demon looked fantastic, but the pig, the green screen sets, and the over-the-top ending are just so cartoon and obviously fake that it takes away from the film.One of the biggest problems for the film is the forced romance between the central characters. There is no chemistry between them. Miss Duan follows Xuan Zang to each of his encounter with the demons to ensure his safety and when the battle is over tries to get him to confess he loves her, which is something he never does until the ending. She gets rejected, if I remember correctly, 3 or 4 times before (SPOILER WARNING) he finally admits to loving her for 10,000 years as she dies! This romance had about as much heat and passion in it as Twilight. I couldn't believe how flat and forced it was with no payoff.But there are more crimes against this movie which just annoyed me to no end—blatant stealing of items from other Stephen Chow movies. Now part of me believes that Stephen Chow didn't direct this whole movie—in fact, you can see that there are two directors.The Water Demon sequence is about 15 to 20 minutes long and is on a beautifully constructed set—similar to the one found in Kung Fu Hustle. The humor here is excellent, the camera shots, the tension, the drama, everything works perfectly. I was thrilled to be watching one of my favorite Chinese directors hit his mark and exceed. However, after that sequence and a short encounter with Xuan Zang's teacher, Buddha in earthly form, the film falls apart and the ripping off begins. Here are some examples: 1.) The Nursery Rhyme Book: in this film, Xuan Zang uses a book of nursery rhymes in an attempt to bring out the goodness in the demons. Other demon hunters laugh at him and mock him from using it, which later turns out to be a very powerful weapon against the Monkey King. In Kung Fu Hustle it's the same thing—main character buys a book of Kung Fu from a guy, everyone thinks it's a joke, but later on he realizes how to use and becomes a great Kung Fu master.2.) The score from this movie comes from Kung Fu Hustle.3.) Prince Important uses magic swords to fight in the exact same way as the blind music killers from Kung Fu Hustle.4.) (SPOILERS) Buddha kills the Monkey King with the Palm Stephen Chow's character in Kung Fu Hustle used to defeat the villain.All these factors lead me to believe that Stephen Chow directed the first part and was basically helping with the film rather than directing. If I am wrong, then it's a sad day when you see such comedic genius fall so far from grace. If you want to see a hilarious Stephen Chow movie about the Journey to the West see his old movies instead.The last thing I will mention is the endingoh man, what a joke! (SPOILERS) In the end, the three demons join our main character as he travels to the west to spread the word of Buddha—but why would you want to see the continued adventures of a demon who ate a little girl, a demon that had a hotel used to lure travelers so he could eat them, or a Monkey King who ripped a guy's throat out and killed the main characters love?",negative
Journey to the West,"Fortunately, the movie packs Stephen Chow's comedic style, or I would call it contains his soul. There's Chow's usual style of comedy, action, love story, and some meaning behind life. Well, what more is needed in a blockbuster movie? Unfortunately, nothing is perfect. I went into the cinema without any expectation, and I didn't read any reviews so I could enjoy the whole movie as if I was the first to do so. I understand that Chow directed this movie, and even demonstrated to retain the ""feel"" of his usual style. Still, I find the first 15 minutes of the movie to be a little dry in terms of humor. As the protagonist enters the scene it was a bit difficult for me to laugh. However, as the story unfolds, and as the mainstream humor pours in, laughter floods the cinema wave after another. To add, the protagonist's wacky hair style, does resemble Chow in some ways.The CGI is of top quality, I can see the movie spending a lot of money on CGI. Many of the scenes contain a lot of visual detail and picturesque grounds. The music is familiar and lovely, I shall not reveal too much.Show Luo's appearance in this movie was like his usual funny-self in his TV entertainment news. I would appreciate it more if he would have neglected his usual style and adopted a new one. It's not a bad thing, but it's not a good thing too, it lies somewhere on the neutral side. I guess on the good side, his fans will love to see him.Trying my best not to disclose too much. This movie is a prequel to his previous 2 part movie, ""A Chinese Odyssey Part One: Pandora's Box, and A Chinese Odyssey Part Two: Cinderella."" The essence of this movie is how it somehow relates to ""A Chinese Odyssey"" in terms of how life is, in its cycle. The feelings the protagonist experienced in this movie is similar to what his disciple experienced in ""A Chinese Odyssey"". The good news for those who haven't seen ""A Chinese Odyssey"", is that you can watch this movie on its own.Lastly, there are some tear-jerking scenes. My eyes welled up at some parts, but I stayed a man. I would give this a 9.5 out of 10 because of its imperfection, but the scores only allow whole numbers. So.... enjoy the movie.",positive
Bang Bang,"This is just a mindless, senseless and meaningless film.

Dilwale,It is hilarious to see the first 4 pages of reviews of Dilwale has a 10* rating which was rather surprising to me. So I go in to the profile of each of those people and there you have it most of the reviewers had joined IMDb in Dec and this is the only movie they have rated.It is just sad when movie makers have to create fake profiles and rate the movie high so the public would fall for it and watch the movie. But this is such a sad strategy as we can not be fooled for long.I wanted to check the reviews first before watching the movie but thankfully the real reviews from real people have told me exactly what i needed to know!,negative
Dilwale,The script for this was written by a 6 year old who watched too many Hollywood. That is the only way I can interpret this movie. More that half of this movie is CARS and then some Michael Bay sh*t. The song locations or songs not make any sense.I like SRK and Kajol as couple but I never expected that they will act in such a movie. Even half the dialogs were reference to other movies. The action scenes were too short for enjoyment. If you go too deep in movie for logic (I always do because I want good logic in a good movie) then you will bang your head against the wall.My conclusion is that if you are looking to waste 2h 38m of your time and to see the return of SRK and Kajol jodi then go watch the film. But if you're looking for a good story or at least a logical film then really don't waste your money or your time. Thank you!,positive
Dhoom 3,"Aamir Khan dons the helmet this time and sets on thrilling escapes. Chase is the buzz word in Dhoom. Instead of being called action films, Dhoom movies fit the description of adventure. There is an underlying socialist theme: the corporate domination, the exploitation of common people by banks, their arbitrary attitude, prejudice and so much. It's a circus guy's battle against a bank. A common man versus establishment. Three chases are almost enough. One more would have been better. It doesn't matter that they don't show how the banks were robbed. The chases are so well executed that it doesn't matter. The circus stunts during the chases are awesome. Full points for that.The suspense-buster scene is directed with sheer brilliance. Aamir makes it special with a great performance. ACP Jai Dixit has shades of gray. He too is a part of the ""system"" like Anderson and the bank. The ending is a sad commentary on our society, deeply moving with love between two brothers.",negative
Dhoom 3,"Sometimes in cinema it is difficult to live up to hype. However, Dhoom 3 exceeds all expectations by packing a solid punch. The start was excellent and emotional, propped up by great performances from Jackie Shroff and Sidharth Nigam, the kid who plays young Aamir. YRF were indeed fortunate to find a kid who is not only a gymnast but a talented actor. I thought the cruel bank guy was good in his small part. He should've got a longer part. After the hasty Iqbal (Jackie) commits suicide, his son decides to take revenge. He targets the bank using his circus tricks and incredible gymnastics.As good as Aamir acts, he gets a very good script here that gets the best out of him. The ""dhoom"" scenes i.e. the chases are awesome. Modern cameras and VFX effects make them even better.Aamir's acting gets better and better as the story progresses. This is one one hell of a job by Aamir, on par with his best works.*****SPOILERS AHEAD*****To be frank, ACP Jai Dixit has become a liability since Dhoom 2 because his character makes things redundant. Since Dhoom 2 had a happy ending, his pesky interruptions didn't matter. But in Dhoom 3 the ending is sad, just because they had to give leverage to his character. Alas! they miss out on many tricks. Sahir's mastery and the twists around his characters are so good that he could have easily toppled Jai. Alas! Jai's character needs face saving because he's supposed to be one of the principal characters. He comes across as a big time nuisance.The whole angle about Jai called by US police to help them is hard to fathom. But we understand it's ""dhoom"" and some level of cinematic liberty has to be taken to involve a story like this in Chicago because it's hard to visualize this story on the streets of India.",positive

Bajirao Mastani,"This movie had already garnered expectations of epic proportions due to the cast, crew and the director, Mr. Sanjay Leela Bhansali. This movie had been in the making for over a decade and hence had already created ample curiosity in the moviegoers minds. After watching the movie, I was at a loss of words. I don't even know where to begin! The music, screenplay, acting, dialogues and the beautiful story of 3 complex characters - everything is magnificent and spectacular! This movie is poetry in motion, easily one of the most epic tales in Indian history being translated in such a classy yet relatable manner on screen! Each scene and each dialogue gets the viewers completely hooked! People were involved and taken back into the 18th century - such was the appeal of the movie! The acting is PHENOMENAL! Ranveer Singh has always delivered fabulous performances, but this performance will be remembered until the end of his career as the performance that catapulted him into the hearts of the Indian cinema lovers. He has done a beyond brilliant job and as a viewer, we laugh, cry and root for him throughout the movie! He's the out and out star of the film. Priyanka Chopra is her usual magnificent self, nothing else can be expected of her after delivering award winning performances in Barfi and Mary Kom. She lights up the scenes she's in. It's amazing how she's good at dance, acting and emoting on screen! Her pain as Bajirao's first wife is captivating and makes the viewers feel for her! What else can be said about the ruling queen of Bollywood, Deepika Padukone, that hasn't already been written!! She is a spectacle all by herself! She makes us cry, laugh, weep, and look at her in awe! She's fabulous in the kathak number, ""mohe rang do laal"" and she shines in every scene of the film! Especially in the scene where she meets kashibai and in the scene where she is jailed! Her eyes are truly the window to Mastani's soul! She matches Ranveer''s energy and their chemistry is undoubtedly historic and classic! What fabulous acting! The supporting cast is a marvel in itself, Tanvi Azmi as Bajirao's mother is fantastic! Her acting abilities are par excellence, couldn't have imagined anyone else in that role! The music, costumes, scenery, sets and decor are exquisite! Nothing less can be expected from an SLB film! This movie is easily one of the top 5 cinema experiences in the past 10 years! It excels in both content and creativity! I will definitely be watching the movie again, it's simply addictive and outstanding and leaves a lasting impression on the viewers mind. A 10/10 experience! Loved it.",positive
A Hard Day,"When I saw the poster that presented one man helping a man hold a gun to his head in a ""go ahead and do it"" matter, I assumed I was getting more of an action movie. Instead, the movie was more of a suspense thriller, but I'm not complaining at all, the movie gave me just what I need.A police man involved in a hit and run has a hard day when he tries to cover it up especially after he discovers someone saw him do it.Well done film making from front to back. the movie is filled with plenty of conflict that makes for some good twist and turns. It's able to do the whole ""just when you think it's over..."" bit without it getting stale for the audience. You want to know what's going to happen at the very end, but I welcomed all the obstacles that came along, they really hold your interest.Especially the main antagonist who reminds me of Micheal Shannon's character in the movie Premium Rush, but a little more confident and darker. It was not the action movie that I though it was but it does not let down. Watching this will make your day.",negative
A Hard Day,"Director Kim Seong-hoon's sophomore film A Hard Day arrives 8 years after his directorial debut, How The Lack Of Love Affects Two Men was released back in 2006.Now, this film is a nerve racking roller-coaster ride, so the less you know going in the better. I shall attempt to introduce this film in one sentence: A comedy-action-thriller about the chaos that ensues after a detective is involved in a hit and run.The film smoothly and skillfully balances the dark comedy, action and thriller elements, giving us ingenious set pieces (a particularly memorable one involving a toy soldier...) and also well-paced and effective suspense. The film does not waste a shot, let alone a scene to make audiences laugh, squirm and be intrigued through it's twists and turns. It's tightly-wound from beginning to end and will surely be one of the best times you'll have in the cinema (or in your home) this year.Lee Seon-gyun (who you may recognize from Hong Sang-soo's films such as Nobody's Daughter Haewon) plays the lead role of detective Ko, a divorced father of a little girl who may not be the most ethical of cops. Lee carries the film, delivering a charismatic and humorous performance that makes us root for his character when he is faced with tough situations and pitted against Cho Jin-Woong's formidable protagonist. Kudos to Cho for interestingly pulling off a role that could have easily been bland. This film was also filmed beautifully. It's gorgeous to look at, thanks to cinematographer Kim Tae-Sung, who gives us dynamic and impressive shots (one that immediately comes to mind is an overhead shot during a chase).It's refreshing to see a South Korean film that's playful and never stops being fun, after the recent slew of superb but disturbing, dark thrillers such as I Saw The Devil, New World and The Man From Nowhere. Don't be fooled, this film has its dark moments. Most importantly, it holds one of the quintessential elements of movies: taking audiences on a ride that endlessly intrigues and keep them wanting more, having no clue where the next moment will take them.",positive
Batman: Gotham by Gaslight,"Batman Gotham by gaslight I believe is based off a comic. I can't remember much of the interview so do bare with me.I am sorry but I am just not impressed with the movie at all. The whole story was predictable over who was behind the murders of those women that got killed by Jack the Ripper. I will give it some credit since the animation is good quality and the voice cast was really good. Especially since it was nice hearing Bruce Greenwood voice Batman again and I am looking forward to hearing him again in season 3 of Young Justice. Well at least we never had weird shippings like Batman and Batgirl/Nightwing and Harley Quinn seriously? God knows what was Timm thinking when he was making those movie. Now this? Even though Justice League Gods and monsters chronicles was messed up and nearly killed the DC Universe at least the movie made up for it (see my reviews). This on the other hand is just student work i mean seriously: Jim Gordon is the ripper?, Tim, Dick and Jason are orphans running the on the streets and are raised by some mugger to steel?, Barbra Gordon is a psychopath?,I could go on and on but I am going to end my review here.",negative
Batman: Gotham by Gaslight,"Decent story; pathetic, ultra-cheap, non-animation! It looks like they had told the basic story line to a bunch of completely talentless 5th-graders and told them to ""take some hard-lead ugly-colored pencils and draw us some pictures of this story.""",positive

Deathgasm,But the music was weak and laden with synthesizers. It was like a pop band with get-up and of course the jokes were juvenile. I guess this is a joke like Baby'metal' or something.,negative
Deathgasm,"This is what I like when it's about gore. It has to be funny, otherwise just watch a horror movie instead. I would not call this horror but just gory comedy. The best movie in that genre still remains Braindead, and of course the Evil Dead movies, but this one I will remember as well. The exaggeration in the gory details is what makes it funny. The amount of slashed body parts and the inventive ways they use to do it is just hilarious. The script might not be the best ever but that's not what it is about with a movie like Deathgasm. It's just a bit fun. Fun for people like me that get that kind of humor. Some others will probably hate that movie and that's okay. If you like metal music and gore then you will for sure love this movie. I did and I will watch this one again in a few years.",positive
Batman Ninja,"The art style pays homage to traditional painters like Hokusai and kayosai. Japanese print art and caligraphy are used to get effect to make this one of the best looking Batman animated films released in the last decade. Batmans costumes alone are superb from his great blue glowing tech suit in the beginning to the ninja clothing at the end. Joker too gets a lavish makeover that'll make toy companies stress for ages trying to replicate.
Unfortunately the plot goes from the implausible time travel plot (but ok I'll go with it) to out right bat crap insane in the last 20 minutes or so. It seems to want to do a bit for every kind of fan of japanese anime. One minute it's a stunning ninja scroll style martial arts romp, next it's a transformers/gundam style robot slugfest. 
I honestly started laughing loudly when the army of monkeys (yes you read that right) all join together to make one big giant armoured monkey (yet again you are reading this correctly) to fight a huge mecha robot made up of the top 5 batman villains houses (seriously... it's their homes!).
I was laughing really hard but nothing would prepare me for what happened next! As the giant armoured monkey began to lose to the giant house monster a swarm of bats surrounded the mecha money and turned it into a colossal batman called ""bat god"".
It was at this point I yelled ""oh jesus god no!"" And damn near wet my trousers laughing so hard. I don't think that was supposed to be the desired effect.
I suspect it will work well for a bunch of drunk guys looking for a movie to lampoon and laugh at like Tommy Wiseau's The Room or Samurai Cop. The dialogue feels hokey in places but this could be due to having to translate directly from japanese but sometimes it's too on the nose. Again it looks fantastic but a change in art style right in the middle really jars. After a huge battle between joker and batman on a boat, red hood is strolling along a country footpath and comes across a man and his wife farming. He then accuses the man of being the joker and begins to beat him. Batman appears from nowhere and stops him saying that the farmer used to be the joker but he isn't anymore and they should leave the old farmer/former joker alone. There is no explanation as to what the time frame is from the last scene to this scene is and almost feels like it doesn't belong or they tacked it on realising there was a gaping plothole as to why joker randomly goes missing for a while and then shows up at the end just to fight batman. There is fun to be had with this film and again it looks so great but it throws almost every kind of japanese anime into the mix and really pushes the envelope of a realistic setting. This wouldn't too much of a problem but there feels like two conflicting styles of storytelling happening, one based around batman being stripped of all his tech to find out what he is without it, ala Iron Man 3 and rhe other has giant monkey monsters, submarines, huge mounted gatling guns, spiritually aware bats, hive minded monkeys and fighting houses. Altogether it leaves for a ""what the hell was that feeling"" and finally ends with Batman returning to Gotham, alfred using a horse drawn batmobile garnished in feudal japanese decor being driven through the streets of gotham with bruce being clearly visible just sitting there! So now anyone that sees the horse drawn batmobile going through the streets can clearly see bruce wayne and now know who Batman is WTF?!
Some things you can put to artistic interpretation but that is just absolutely and fundamentally not Batman. 
Just buy a poster and imagine what the film it could have been.",negative
Batman Ninja,"The main problem with ""Batman Ninja"" is the advertising. Make no mistake, this is a kids film, and had the trailers offered glimpses of its *ahem* wackier moments, serious Batfans would have known to leave well alone. By the end, ""Batman Ninja"" closer resembles the Power Rangers than Batman.I will start with ""Batman Ninja""s sole positive: its subtle combination of hand-drawn anime comic and 3D art styles is gorgeous. I'd go as far as saying this is the most painstakingly beautiful DC animation I've seen.The voice acting is fine, with exception to the worst casting misstep of the Joker since Suicide Squad. The actor Tony Hale portrays him with an irritating manic energy that somehow makes Harley Quinn seem restrained. This was the first indication to me that Batman Ninja would be little more than Saturday morning cartoon fare.The dialogue and characterisations are surprisingly poor throughout. My biggest reservation of cross-pollinating Western and Eastern stories is the lack of true understanding from either side. And so it is in this case. Batman is a fool, unworthy of his reputation as a world-class detective. The Joker is an annoying court jester with none of the more subversive qualities we have come to expect. Catwoman is usually consistent with previous incarnations, but written without depth (as are the other supporting characters).The idea of Batman's technology being stripped from him, forcing him to adapt to his new (or rather, old) environment, is genuinely fascinating. But any fan will tell you that technology does not define the Batman, but rather allow him to operate on a larger scale. Seeing him suffer a mini personality crisis following the destruction of his toys was odd, to say the least.Finally, ""Batman Ninja"" reintroduces the cheesy kitsch of a bygone era, which Warner Bros should know by now is a mistake (Schumacher). The Batman 60s theme tune even plays at one point, just in case it was all too subtle.Warner's animation department is pretty much the only thing they have going for them as far as DC are concerned, but Batman Ninja is a big backwards step, and a wasted opportunity. A one-shot story with a Batman born and raised in feudal, corrupt Tokugawa Japan could have been truly special.",positive
[REC] 4: Apocalypse,"I have never really loved mainstream Hollywood horror movies, and REC's first installment is one of my favorites. While the first film (c. 2007) of the franchise is arguably the best, there is a real debate about the third one, which talks altogether about something else. But, in here, the director-actress duo have successfully closed a good franchise by continuing stories from the second and third films.We are now in a quarantined ship where doctors are researching on a serum that will serve as an antidote to the parasite and its bacteria. Our reporter friend, two Military soldiers, doctors, and the ship's crew fret it out in a ""survival of the fittest"" kinda situation as the subject of the research runs amok. As a zombie apocalypse ensues, alas! without the found footage element, but with security surveillance element, we find out that the truth is not what it seemed to be. And there is more to what happened at the end of installment two.Although the film starts pretty slowly, it becomes spot on after thirty or so minutes. Lots of unwanted blood baths and absurd dialogs may keep you from continuing, but if you are brave enough and forgo these horror film requisites, REC 4 will turn out to be real entertainment. The dark setting helps as the franchise probably ends here.BOTTOM LINE: If you have been following the franchise, this will make an amazing watch with friends and family. Happy New Year 2015!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOFore/Violence: Infinity",negative
[REC] 4: Apocalypse,"Looking forward to see REC 4 ones it was over I was left with mixed emotions. The unique story of REC was gone. By now you do know how the zombies or infected do look and move and the surprises seen in part 1 and 2 are gone. It's of course normal that by part 4 you have seen it all before but even as it has a few intense moments it's the use of lighting and the shots that made it hard to sit through.It starts off rather well because we go back to the apartment were Ángela Vidal (Manuela Velasco) was taken by the infested and disappeared at the end of part 1. They do rescue her not without a few attacks by the way. She's been taken to a cargo on the ocean were they are doing experiments on her and the soldiers who has taken her out of the apartment. It's even funny when suddenly an old lady comes across the story who is asking were the honeymoon takes place, a wink to REC 2. But by then the story weakens a bit because once you see the lab you know what is going to happen. When an experiment goes wrong an infected monkey breaks out of it's cage and spreads the disease. But what could have been a surprising reprise turned into an annoying experience. Lights do flash a lot and the camera moves a lot and is zoomed in for most of the time so it's a on and off of seeing what is going on. The reason is rather simple, the surprise of REC couldn't be done again. It even reminded me a lot of Alien (1979) because Angela becomes the hero and walks around in her undershirt a lot so Ripley isn't that far away. There's a bit of explanation what makes the virus and the end is open so it's off to REC 5 I guess. But I hope that the suspense and the creepy look of the infected like in REC is back there. Don't get me wrong. It isn't that bad after all but due the use of zoomed in shaky camera shots it didn't infected me .Gore 2/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",positive
The Numbers Station,"About 15 - 20 minutes in, I was very close to giving up on this. I'm glad I didn't. It's no masterpiece, but what you'll get is a very authentic, at times claustrophobic and thoroughly convincing thriller.This is a *british* production, and it shows. There are very few Hollywood stereotypes here, just a believable story that avoids most of the action blockbuster clichés and that actually manages to keep you on the edge of your seat as soon as the ""situation"" starts. There's an obvious reason why it seems a bit slow in the beginning, and the impact is all the more effective when it hits.I was slightly worried that Cusack might be miscast in this (that happens frequently with him, I find), but he's actually quite convincing as the suddenly conscience-ridden sociopath assassin he plays.All in all I'm pretty sure this will be both too low-key and a bit slow in the build-up for younger audiences, but it's certainly one of the more intense thrillers I've seen in a while. Mostly, I realize now, because they manage through a thorough build-up, an authentic frame and good acting to actually make me care about what happens to the lead characters. And that's increasingly rare in movies these days, I think.",negative
The Numbers Station,"I saw that this movie only scored 5.4 on IMDb and I wanted to quickly write that it's a whole lot better than that. The movie kept me interested from start to finish. It doesn't slow down appreciably at any point. There isn't an overwhelming amount of action but there is a tense atmosphere throughout. The location is also great. A moody, grey numbers station right out in the middle of nowhere. But the main reason for watching this movie is Cusack who perfectly plays the loner, haunted, tough guy, with a conscience. He's supremely watchable in every frame. In fact, Cusack plays these types of characters better than anything else. He has that suitably detached, dangerous look, down to a tee. He also does ambiguity very well. All of this is displayed really well in the movie. Ackerman is also well cast as the enthusiastic, smart code girl.",positive
Batman and Harley Quinn,"I paid twenty bucks to see this movie in the cinema. Twenty bucks to watch Harley Quinn farting in the Batmobile and Batman telling Nightwing it ""smells like discipline."" I'm serious. The movie was bad enough before that with Harley complaining about being treated like a sex object only to then have her way with Nightwing tied to her bed, but the fart scene was as much as I could take. Yes, I endured the rest of this in order to review it but nothing could save it by then. Poor writing, too many convenient plot devices and a really lazy ending. Plus a post-credit sequence that went for 3.5 minutes and had zero relevance to the actual plot of the movie! I really hope this isn't the direction the DC animated universe is heading, because if that's the case I'm done with it.",negative
Batman and Harley Quinn,"I don't understand the low rating?Batman and Harley Quinn was fun, sexy, and very entertaining to watch. I really liked Melissa Rauch as Harley Quinn, and I really like it when she tied up Nightwing and seduces him. The story and plot are easy to follow along. Harley working alongside Batman and Nightwing is a great touch, and I wonder if Nightwing and Harley will continue to be friends with benefits as long as she stays on her meds? It seems Batman just doesn't trust or thinks Harley is sane enough to make it a permanent relationship. I don't really know what's going to happen, I'm new to the Batman DVD's and haven't really been interested in them until lately.",positive
24,"'24' by Vikram K Kumar is essentially a family drama centered around the idea of time-travel. However, the film also includes elements of romance, action and thrills in ample measures, even though the bulk of the screen time is spent on emphasizing the significance of familial bonds (Appa-Amma-Thaatha-Maama-Maami and so on).The director, who recently made the Telugu drama 'Manam' still seems slightly hungover from it. He has proved that he loves playing with the concept of time (13B, Manam). But the surprise in the screenplay here comes in the form of sci-fi elements. Tamil cinema (and Suriya himself of course!) has been churning out many sci-fi thrillers in recent times (Enthiran, Dashavathaaram, 7aum Arivu, Maattraann, Anegan, Indru Netru Naalai to name a few). Some of these were characterized by an overdone formulaic story replete with masala, while a few of them stood out for their innovative screenplays and seamless blend of sci-fi with other genres.'24' marks a return to the sci-fi genre for Suriya. Hats off to the man for taking up this expensive and ambitious project after many a recent failure (Maasss, Anjaan, Maattraann, 7aum Arivu) and funding it himself. I will not shy away from saying that the production values look top-notch and the CGI is mostly sans notable flaws. The sets boast of decorative extravagance and are mostly a treat to the eyes, at times resembling the lavishness of Shankar films. The cinematography by Tirru is nothing short of spectacular in the initial portions. It would also warrant special mention that different color-tones are attributed to different characters with respect to their portrayal in the film. For instance, the intelligent, yet tender (and at times, clumsy) Dr. Sethuraman (Suriya) and his wife (played by Nithya Menen in an extended cameo) gleam in lighter shades (of golden yellow) while his evil brother Aathreya is burnished in darker shades (of brown).The story is really not that path-breaking to be honest but still holds narrative interest owing to the director's firm grip on attention levels of the audience, by way of utilizing its star lead's boyish charm during the romantic interludes, as well as a welcome change of seeing him play the character of a psychotic antagonist. Aathreya wants his brother's time-travelling device (which happens to be a watch) by hook or by crook and is even willing to murder his brother and his family for the same. Suriya depicts the antagonist Aathreya in a style of his own and the actor seemingly looks like he had fun doing so. The devilish grin and the plain stares are placed at apt junctures by the actor. Suriya, the romantic charmer that he is, uses his potential to the maximum in the scenes with Samantha, although, however cute they may look initially, start to wear out and eventually end up bland. The romance is underplayed in the first half, with Mani (son of Dr. Sethuraman, again played by Suriya) using his time-travel watch to woo Sathya through various instances of play-pause-repeat. ""I'm a watch mechanic madam, enakku ithellaam sarva sadhaaranamaana vishayam"" is a line that brings both laughs and shrugs. Some of the wooing methods deployed here are fun to watch though, and this makes the first half a mildly entertaining affair. The amazing opening segment as well as intriguing interval block are admittedly where the writer-director scores brownie points.The film slows down considerably in initial portion of the second half with family sentiments (even though Saranya Ponvannan is consistently marvellous at her job of exuding maternal warmth!) and downright- silly romance segments thrown in simply for the purpose of extending the run-time. Thankfully, it does not take too long for the sci-fi element to bounce back and take its rightful position in the film and the viewer is rewarded with a feel-good (rather feel- great!) climax. However, it needs be bluntly accepted before and after watching the film that a lot of it works purely on coincidences rather than logic or situational coherence.A R Rahman's music+BGM is certainly a plus-factor although personally, I am of the opinion that a sci-fi film would be much better off without so many song-n-dance routines. If you, as a viewer, are able to forego these minor masalaic tropes and are okay with a run-time of 160 mins (editing dept. could have done better!), then you are in for a decently satisfying sci-fi treat!",negative
24,"This being my first review on IMDb,I'd like to be impartial.Masterpiece.The film's carved so perfectly you'll be satisfied once you come out of the theater. First thing,the story,it'll be what you expect from a time-travel movie.It's not exaggeration when I compare this movie with ""Predestination"" and ""Triangle"".The Interval scene will keep you guessing and if you can guess it,you're wrong anyways. Second thing,Suriya's versatility.Suriya is a perfect cast because you love him and hate him at the same time because he is the protagonist as well as the antagonist. Third thing,background score.Well,what more can you expect from the legend himself. If you see someone giving a rating less than 9,suggest him to watch the movie again because he didn't get it the first time.Thank you for the classic,Vikram Kumar.",positive
American Heist,"I usually don't review movies but I decided to on this one because it was especially bad. Pretty much the entire movie is about two brothers complaining and cussing at each other about why their lives are screwed up. There is nothing American about the mediocre ""heist"" which seems more like a subplot than the whole point of the movie. In fact, the heist doesn't even occur until near the end of the movie. As for the heist itself I don't think it could have been more pathetic. A bunch of thugs walked into the bank killed the manager, and got some cash then were killed by cops. At the end of the movie there are still a lot of loose ends even though I didn't care anyway. Overall it was an awful movie and I wish I could get a refund for my time.",negative
American Heist,After watching I checked the reviews and was quite surprised that they are all pretty negative. The acting of both brothers was very convincing and touched me a lot. I didn't get bored at all but wanted to see what happens next. There were by far enough action scenes. It made the movie look real rather than stupid. I'm not a fan of ridiculous action scenes every five minutes - So this was just fine for me. It's mainly about the relationship and history of the two brothers and was described good enough to understand. I'm a big fan of Adrien Brody and thought his performance was excellent. People should at least give the movie a try and I'm sure lots won't be disappointed. Maybe the title wasn't the right choice but all in all this was an entertaining and cool movie with a surprising end.,positive
Killing Season,"Where to start? Don't second-guess yourself: it's been panned for a reason. It is an ugly, pointless potboiler lacking in brains, charisma and even the slightest hint of excitement. What follows is one and a half hours of very crude torture scenes, mock character development, Macgyver-like scenarios of escape and an abundance of completely unnecessary CGI effects.It just reeks of ""cut and dry"". Obviously it was too much effort to spend time on practical special effects so the director just found a cheap CGI company to scribble in the animals, the weapon effects, the squibs, the sunsets, the lighting, and anything else he can think of. Poor direction. Frankly I would think after such long and successful careers that Travolta and De Niro were beneath such roles. Travolta, as always, brings a kind of raw energy to his role and immerses himself in his character, even if his accent is off he never winks to the audience and does his best to do his job to a good standard. De Niro, however, is out of his element here, with a slipping southern accent that wasn't necessary. He feigns injury like Pierce Brosnan (poorly). Even when threading a metal cable through the exposed wound in his leg he is not convincing. After a poorly conceived prologue, a taut first act will draw you in, but unfortunately it all goes downhill from there. The sheer excess of symbolism and foreshadowing is a clumsy misfire. Macgyver scenarios pile up quickly and the action climax will have you practically laughing at how stupid it is. Seriously. Don't pay to watch this crap.",negative
Killing Season,These actors portrayed the men that the script was written for. De Niro acted like a man who lives in the woods alone and likes country music and as far as Travoltas accent sounds like a man who has tried to speak English as a Serbian the best he can. The guy probably didn't have a great education and that's how he is supposed to sound. Movies aren't supposed to be an adrenaline rush all the time. Its a story about something that could have actually happened. People aren't perfect maybe the things that they did were on purpose. Use your brain! My husband served in the military and served with men from Bosnia and that's how they sound. Its a good movie. Not every story has to end in someone dying.,positive
Haider,"Simply put: Do not see. Or see it. Or see it on TV later. This film is not worthy of such discussion.FOR THE PEOPLE FROM KASHMIR (1). For people from Kashmir, who are looking for some authenticity in the storyline; I am sorry to say that the situations are mostly contrived. The objective is to create pathos for the hero of the film. So, the army is shown as the aggressor in a vacuum and its actions as the instigators for the common man. Many times, the people who fund such propaganda/ political movies have their own agendas and it appears to be very much the case here. There are other objectives and those are from the political leanings of the well-known, separatist-sympathizing, script-writer Basharat Peer. (2). In reality, the anti-terrorist local force, Ikhwan was made more from the people who had been wronged by the terrorists and not from turncoat terrorists. The cause and motivation of these Ikhwanis is not explained as such. The horrors and miseries of the terrorists (many of them being non-Kashmiris from Pakistan and Afghanistan) upon the common man and women, which created Ikhwanis, are not shown. Ikhwanis are shown as mercenaries under the guidance of the Army but Ikhwanis were actually the ones who had earlier been wronged and tortured by monster terrorists and that was their motivation against them. In the film, this Ikhwan-Ul-Muslimeen is deliberately called the Ikhwan-Ul-Mukhbareen. The subtlety in changing the nomenclature should not be lost on you if you are from Kashmir. The History of Kashmir and the names of places in Kashmir are being rewritten with an agenda and the story of the Ikhwan-Ul-Muslimeen seems to have been rewritten with the same agenda. (3). For Kashmiri Hindus, half a million of whom were forced into mass exodus, there is barely any mention and no background is provided about them. The script writer/ movie maker sees that if it was done, you could not develop pathos for any terrorist and Haider eventually is just a terrorist. (4). In the future, if a writer were to actually weave all the subplots (Kashmiri Hindus, What the army was up against, Torture of Locals by the Terrorists, Reasons for the Ikhwan, Role of the rich and the famous and the well off from among the Kashmiri Muslims .) into the narrative, it will be a hell of a story. Haider is not.FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE BACKGROUND ON KASHMIR (I will stick to facts) (1). There were 2 rows occupied in the entire hall. 1 row was occupied by people of Kashmiri origin and their friends. (2). The people in the row behind the Kashmiris were fidgety after the first 20 minutes of the movie. They would walk out and walk back in. I am not sure how many stayed for the length of the movie. (3). The story is supposed to be adapted from Hamlet. During the portions of the movie that touch the Hamlet storyline, one could only hear guffaws and lack of inclination towards the film. (4). During what should have been the most touching scenes and songs, people kept casually leaving their seats to fetch popcorn, to ease their heads, to take a break (5). After the movie, during the follow-up dinner, I asked some of the non-Kashmiri friends what they thought of the movie. They are open-minded, liberals and what you will call very secular. They did not believe the storyline was as much about Kashmir as it was about Haider and his conflicting/ unclear emotions for his mother and her undeclared, under the covers relationship with his uncle. Unfortunately, this portion of the story and the inter-relationships of the people were not developed well because the script-writer/ filmmaker chose to cover the Kashmir issue way more than required. The movie therefore became a hotchpotch. Even without any background, the non-Kashmiri people in the audience did not believe that the story was anywhere close to the truth. It was just their feeling about the story, even if it had been fact. The problem was that the script-writer/ film-maker tried too hard to thrust their emotion on the audience and that fact had not been lost. Think of a salesman trying too hard to sell to you and your reaction! (6). Their rating for the movie ranged from 1.5 to 2. They said that if they did not know that it was based on Hamlet and if it was an original story, they may have rated it 2.5.CONCLUSION This movie is not a game-changer or a piece of history for anyone. You can safely watch it now, ignore it, watch it for free on TV later, save your time and do something better ..(1). It will not appeal to the young Muslims because they know that it is not the truth. They are up against an incredible amount of propaganda anyway and if they have to be affected, it will be due to that propaganda than due to this movie. (2). The Kashmiri Hindus will know that this is a lop-sided story. They should not worry that general people (other Indians, an international audience  ) will believe in this being a statement of truth. (3). The remaining audience finds the movie to be only moderately entertaining (for art, visuals, drama, suspense  ) but certainly not a reflection of truth.",negative
Haider,"HAIDER to me is an acronym that means the following:H. Haunting. Be it in its background score, music, lyrics, playback (especially Rekha Bharadwaj, Sukhwinder Singh, and Arijit Singh), cinematography, or backdrop of Kashmir in 1995, Haider is Haunting, and how! The film will stay with you long after you have left the theater.A. Astounding. Haider is an astoundingly adept adaptation of a classic written almost 415 years ago that can be enjoyed irrespective of your knowledge about the Shakespearean Tragedy - Hamlet. If you don't know Hamlet, great! You do? Even better! I. Incredible. Haider is incredible - in terms of its performances. Be it that of Shahid Kapoor (Haider/Hamlet) who performs a complex role with the kind of award worthy chutzpah that should silence all his detractors once and for all. Or for that matter the the triumvirate of Tabu (Halala/Gertrude) - ethereal, dauntless, and supreme, Kay Kay Menon (Khurram/Claudius) - terrific, resolute, and subtle or Irfan Khan (Rooh/The Ghost of Hamlet's father) - rudimentary and underplayed. Not to be forgotten is Shraddha Kapoor (Aarshi/Ophelia) who pitches in a performance that is 'picture'esque perfect and so full of finesse. And of course the two Salman Khan's who are fans of the superstar and who will surely gain some fans of their own post this film. In fact, every single member of the cast pitches in a perfect performance here, irrespective of the role and duration.D. Daring. Haider is daring in talking about issues that many wouldn't touch with a bargepole and for the way it has juxtaposed a Shakespearean tragedy with a human tragedy - Kashmir. The valley is a character here that finally finds a voice of its own. The interpretations of that voice are truly brilliant.E. Effective. Sometimes experimentation and reinterpretations fail. Not here. With layer upon layer waiting for the audience to be interpreted (for example the touch of Oedipal complex between a mother and son, the growing of guilt of a well meaning lover, the song of the gravediggers, the examples of 'Chutzpah' and its comparison with AFSPA etc). Haider is effective on multiple levels and truly faultless in its execution.R. Rooh (Spirit/Soul). This is a film with an indomitable spirit that filmmakers would die to include in their body of work, and which Vishal Bharadwaj effectively manages to in this lifetime. This film has that which many a masterpiece may sometimes lack - a soul. A terrific triumph encompassing its soulful music, soul stirring performances, and soul warming message.In short - watch Haider - in a theater. For Vishal Bharadwaj, the Director/Composer/Writer. For Shahid, the rising prince. For Tabu the eternal Queen. For Gulzar, the lyricist. For the cinematography by Pankaj Kapoor and the editing by Aarif Sheikh. And finally for Kashmir, the unforgettable voice of humanity.",positive
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Maybe the movie gets more intelligible and interesting later, but we were so bored and tired of listening to the actors whine and yell that we quit early. Life's too short.Most everything was very unrealistic, which is especially unfortunate when the story is supposedly a TRUE one. The characters weren't as smart and level-headed as their history suggests they should be. And there was non-stop idiotic vocabulary and violence. No thank you.Basically, the film is an opportunity wasted. Huge bummer. We would have loved to have seen the real story with believable characters and scenarios.",negative
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"How a crime drama with such good cast can be so dull is borderline a crime. The actors are good, but the characters they play have the personality of barren unsympathetic schmucks. The screenplay and conversation are dry, primarily dabbling in curses and complaints for nearly the entire movie. While there are clearly a couple of good moments by the actors, they are too few to sustain interest for the rest of boring banters.Kidnapping Mr. Heineken is exactly what it advertises, the story of five men who are down on their luck and decide to snatch a billionaire in hope for monetary gain. It's amazing that none of these five character is even close to being relatable. The movie tries to depicts individuals who are pushed to do illegal things, yet they are all manipulative, aggressive and severely lacking empathy.At latter half they are even interchangeable since everyone has a knack for whining, in exception of Sam Worthington's character who surprises audience with poor and crazy decisions. Probably the best decision the movie did was to put Anthony Hopkins as Heineken in a box and let him do a few monologues. Still, there is no tangible connection between Heineken and the kidnappers, there's not even connection between the kidnappers. When the movie tries to pull friendship theme, it only makes things more awkward.For action crime, one would expect an intelligent plot, perhaps major twists and thought out plans. There's a barely any level of sophistication here as five of them partially wing it and hope for the best. In fact, most of the times they are just fooling around, laughing annoyingly and verbally abusing each other.The film offers the shallow sense of helplessness and uneasiness as audience watch five aversive men threatening an old man for money and bicker with each other.",positive

Rangasthalam 1985,"I was awed while watching the movie, a Telugu movie in ages, made with pure heart and soul.
You don't see actors on screen, only the characters with full heart and soul. Each character was potrayed beautifully with 200% effort by all the actors. I had my expectations while looking at cast but wow ever actor did more than 200% justice to their characters, which can be directly attributed to director Sukumar's effort in direction department, raw and realistic art work, beautiful cinematography, each and every other department.I was waiting for Sukumar to show his potential on such realistic movie rather than trying to make an intelligent movies which has no heart and soul. We all know what he is capable of but I am finally glad that he decided to work on such a beautiful script like Rangasthalam rather than pointless intellectual movies which I didn't like personally (this is purely because of my affection towards Sukumar, wanting him to make exceptional movies only).Coming to performances, Ramcharan was a standout as Chittibabu, I felt the character deeply realistic like many people we see in villages, innocent, pure at heart and stubborn at the same time, this is an outstanding performance by Ram Charan, I can't say anything about awards/rewards, but he won my heart with this movie.If this movie doesn't win any major Indian awards this year, we can only pray the god to give working brains to the awards committees.This is one of a kind movie came in Telugu after a long time. Beautiful story telling, outstanding performances, tons of emotions, go for it.",positive
Zashchitniki,"Collection of all the movie clichés, plagiarized plot line, mixed with Russian imperialism (somehow claiming former Soviet republics in any stupid way possible). Not good enough to be a joke or a trash...total waste of resources.Do not waste your time on it, not to say - god save you from going to cinema and paying money for this crap.",negative
Zashchitniki,"from the heavy handed introduction / title sequence involving unpleasant manipulation of Humans, I knew I was in for a treat. My viewing pleasure was massively enhanced by the appallingly translated subtitles, (talking about a daughter, saying ""he did this and died"" or something along those lines) The frequent, perplexing ""gazing at another's grief"" scenes with characters that looked as though they had all traces of expression CGI'd from their faces. News bulletins that looked as if the broadcasters didn't really know how serious all this might be. Arsus (the bear) seemed to be suffering some kind of existential crisis going on most of the time, even when he was a bear, and the grinning oaf that seemed to be the bad guy was fantastic, posturing with his hands in the air whilst manipulating his machines. So in all seriousness, one of the best / worst films I have ever experienced in my life of watching Really Bad science fiction films. and believe me this was Really Bad. Great Fun.",positive
Tracers,"In an age of slick polished mega-budget CGI Marvel movies, Tracers provides a refreshing antidote, with actors doing the majority of their own CGI free stunts captured by a hand held camera that injects a sense of energy into the film. Targeting a young adult audience with a grittily realistic story in a contemporary setting, Tracers lands squarely on a gap in the market and stars Taylor Lautner, who was considered one of the hottest young actors of his generation at the start of the decade.It's easy to see why Taylor was attracted to the project as it re-teams him with the producers of the multi-billion dollar franchise Twilight (that shot Lautner to global fame) and hooks Taylor up with the stunt co-ordinator behind the Bond and Bourne films, Gary Powell. Allowing Taylor (who trained in martial arts when he was a child) to showcase his natural athletic agility, as his character Cam attempts to escape a debt he owes to loan sharks by joining a Parkour gang who use their skills for dishonest ends.The film zips along at a fair pace jumping straight into the action as Cam literally falls for Nikki, the love interest of the film played by Marie Avgeropoulos, who unwittingly draws Cam into the Parkour gang. Lautner has taken some criticism in the past for his acting, particularly in Abduction, his last action movie. In Tracers Lautner answers his critics, giving his most solid dramatic performance to date. It's not a showy theatrical performance, but a restrained naturalistic one that overcomes the scripts poor dialogue and convincingly conveys young Cam's emotions throughout.Marie Avgeropoulos (best known for TV show The 100) also gives a fine performance in the film, but ultimately the chemistry between the two leads doesn't quite catch fire enough to draw the audience in. This is just one of the films flaws, which has its roots in the clunky script rather than the performances. Unfortunately the film doesn't allow enough time for their relationship to develop and nor do we truly get to understand the peril that Nikki's character is in, which makes it difficult for the audience to truly root for them.In fact the script is where this film takes most of its tumbles, along with the underwritten character development there is a sprinkling of plot holes and a lack of variety in the action sequences. All of this might in part be due to the films US PG-13 certificate which calls for some restraint, leaving some of the dangers the characters face only hinted at. However the film has no aspirations to be Citizen Kane and these shortcomings are easy to overlook.Despite its flaws the film has some nice touches. Spanish director, Daniel Benmayor, in making his Hollywood debut injects a real sense of raw energy into the film. As Miller, a Fagin-esque character played by Adam Rayner who controls the Parkour gang explains how the gang operates to Cam, the film segues beautifully into the next action set-piece. There is a creative use of the sound mix at moments of high tension and even the opening credits have a touch of a Saul Bass flourish about them. Honourable mention should also go to the film's music composer, Lucas Vidal and his energetic score for the movie.Ultimately though the film, whilst enjoyable, fails to live up to its full potential. It is only Taylor Lautner's eminently watchable performance that lifts this film up and pulls the audience through. In the process he demonstrates his leading man credentials and shows Hollywood that they are missing a trick if they don't pair him up with a decent script and an experienced director soon.",negative
Tracers,"I really enjoyed this movie. It did exactly what it intended to do, entertain. The pace was just right for me. The character relationships were, for the most part, believable. I don't think they set out to win an Academy Award, but more to make a quality action film of this genre that would entertain a wide variety of tastes. The ladies will like this along with their men. The only weak spot was the character of Miller and that was more the writing than the acting. Also I cringe when an actors lines have to explain the plot instead of the story itself doing the job but that was very minor in this case. Marie Avgeropoulos is new to me and I want more. I rated it 9 because I got more than I expected. Truthfully I hope there's more. I can easily see how a series of films based from this could be possible.",positive
Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV,"The film is great, amazing graphics, amazing actor rendering, amazing everything except a decent story for anyone that is not going to play the FFXV game.I would really give it a 10 however they just left it open for the game (hence the video at the end of the credits), quite a few questions unanswered too (for example what were the demons, how were they summoned, where did they come from?). I had no idea what was happening half the time, why were they fighting, why were some characters so important. All I can say about this film is that it is a introduction to the FFXV game, if you don't own a PS4 or an Xbox One are a gamer or have no intention of purchasing FFXV then this will be just a mediocre very nice polished CGI.I have no intention in buying the game and I feel duped, like a marketing ploy. I won't be buying a console and the game just because of a movie.I think by making the movie an introduction to the game they are alienating anyone not playing the games (at least previous movies were stand alones). The only thing I can suggest is to start reading more on Wiki and once the game is out hunt around on Youtube to see all videos from the game to understand the story better. Obviously this is what I will be doing as they left me wanting more. I wish they would make a sequel once the game has been out to tie things together.By all means, watch it, it is well worth it for the animation, amazing, however bear in mind that it is just an introduction to the FFXV game. If you are someone that has played the previous FF installments, loves the FF universe, pre-ordered and is looking forward to the new FFXV game then this is exactly for you and I highly recommend it. For everyone else...",negative
Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV,"I have seen several movies regarding or based on video game, yet none not even close of Kingslaive. I also saw the other two Final Fantasy movies and neither of them is even half good as this one. This isn't a masterpiece overall, has its own flawes, but nonetheless it's a great and solid movie, worth watching and rewatching.
The CGI is spectaculos, so realistic and well-made, carrying you truly into a story, a fantasy. We see new power additions to the word, the eye-catching warp magic forged by the blink dagger of the glaive which is a pretty cool thing to watch.
But above all are the character, many of them very interesting -I really wanted to know even more about each of them- and the story itself. Some said the plot is not coherent enough. I think those people did not paid enough atention, especially at the prologue. Kingsglaive is not just a story about battles and special effects, it's a story about duty, about courage, about sacrificies and responsabilities. You care for those characters and their fates. It tells a good and engaging story, something that movies nowadays completly lacking. It has soul and sentiment. It has a message.
Don't mind the critics and the low-rated reviews. Give it a try, you may be pleasantly surprised.",positive
Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru,"The thing good with the movie was the narration technique. It cuts back and forth between what happened 5 years ago and what is happening now in the story. Rahman gave us a nice performance. Almost all the actors were nice. The camera was nice. It used long shots wherever necessary.Now let me come to the problem.The third act is full of plot holes. 1. Why would Krish try to rape Shruti on the day when it is her birthday? There are all chances that at least two or three people would be there to celebrate the birthday. Why couldn't he go on some other day? It was because it was her birthday that Rajeev came and Krish had to lose his life. 2. Why does Krish ask Vaishnavi to lodge a complaint saying that Shruti is missing? Why couldn't he ask her to talk with his father in private about the whole matter? Why does she lie to Deepak that she came to the apartment at dawn?Besides, the scene which is shown like a prologue does not happen at all. That was a very cheap attempt to make us feel like it is a very big twist that we are watching in the third act. All in all, the third act spoils the whole movie.",negative
Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru,"It has all the ingredients of a perfect murder mysteries. Right from the keeping the viewers engaged through multiple perspectives of how the murder could have happened to increasing the pace and twists till the climax, it is screen play at its best.To choose new faces and to go without songs, i think the director deserves a special mention. This movie is an experience you will love. You will feel that you are a part of the investigation and that is where the director scores.You know a movie is brilliant if the entire audience applauds when the credits starts rolling. Kudos to the entire team to have scripted such a price of work. 10/10",positive
Bleach,"I'm a HUGE fan of the Bleach series, so I couldn't help but critique every little thing as I watched. There were a lot of things that this movie did very well: character and set design being the main selling points. Renji and Byakuya both look EXCELLENT, and Chad is just about perfect. It's a shame he didn't get the screen time he needed.And that's where most of my dissatisfaction comes in to play: time. There is so much character development lacking simply because there's not enough time in a single movie to develop everything the way it needs to. For crying out loud, Orihime comes across as a nobody with an unjustifiable crush.. Talk about disappointing.Ichigo himself is, overall, a success. They did a good job portraying his desire to protect people and his overall negative attitude. So in short, his personality was well-done! What I WANTED to see from him, though, was that overwhelming feeling of power. The anime does an excellent job demonstrating the weight of someone's reiatsu (aka spirit pressure), but that concept is practically nonexistent here. Which means all of the fights (though amazingly choreographed with some clever editing to try matching the speed of the anime) lack some of the awe and wonder that sets Shinigami apart from mortals.Oh, and minor spoiler alert for fans of the anime... the scene with the Menos Grande were cut entirely, as was Getsuga Tenshou. Let that sink in for a moment.So why watch this at all? Because most of the story is incredibly accurate - until you get to the last half hour. The fights are pretty epic. And altogether, you can visualize the anime quite clearly as you're watching, giving you a wonderful sense of nostalgia.",negative
Bleach,"Go see it. There is a reason people are raving about it as the first decently done adaptation of an anime. It's not perfect, but it is legitimately great and keeps the spirit and feel of the series. Most of the negative reviews of this I've seen so far seem to be coming from people who either don't know the series very well (a hazard with professional reviewers, since they cover so many things), don't understand Japanese cinema (some acting techniques/nuances are different between East and West), or who are just determined to hate it because everything doesn't look 100% identical to the manga (I've seen far worse anime to live-action with far bigger budgets, believe me). This movie condenses the entire half of the first season of the anime (books 1-6), and leaves room for a sequel without leaving hanging threads in the event one never happens.Like many other fans, I was very, VERY skeptical of this movie when it first was announced. I was honestly that person going, ""Oh god, another live action movie of an anime. Can't wait to see how cheesy and bad this ends up.""I'm a convert. You win, Mr. Sato. Take my left kidney and sell it, and whatever else you need to fund the next movie in your trilogy. I've seen it three times now (I live in Japan) and am going again tomorrow. I'm still not bored watching it. It's the sort of movie that fans of the series will keep finding new gems tucked away with each rewatch. If you're not intimately familiar with the manga or anime however, don't sweat it - this is very accessible to newcomers.Characters - 9/10 There are some physical differences (Urahara is older, Masaki's hair isn't red, etc.), but the acting is solid and the character dynamics/relationships are exactly the way they are in the manga. Even if the character looked a bit different, I believed the actors as the characters. Ichigo and Rukia may not have the exact same hair or face as you'd expect, but they absolutely nailed the characters - Ichigo's determination and grit, Rukia's spunky sarcasm, it's all really great.Costumes - 8/10 There was some saving of the budget here for fight scenes - you won't see exact replicas of captain's haoris or the tabi with straw sandals. Rather, the film tries to make things more realistic (i.e. a more natural orange for Ichigo's hair, smaller size hairpins for Orihime, etc.) It looks less like the wacky cosplay of the Rock Musical for Bleach and more like a legit world people actually live in.Music - 10/10 Invokes the anime without copying it, and Alexandros has two kickass songs that make Bleach feel fresh and edgy and hip with a touch of Japan's ancient history and the otherwordliness of the Soul Society.Plot - 9/10 Whenever possible, the film follows the manga almost exactly. For the purposes of sticking 6 manga volumes into one movie, some minor characters (Jinta, Mizuiro, Ururu, etc.) are not introduced, and some events get condensed (i.e. Uryu's hollow bait kicks off the Hexapodus fight that makes Ichigo take being a shinigami seriously, not a Menos Grande). Overall, the story is still very close to the way the manga told it, just condensed.Props - 8/10 Soul Pagers get replaced with something more like a glowing, teardrop shaped stone that looks more otherwordly (let's be honest, when Bleach debuted flip phones were cool, now they're a bit ancient), the zanpakuto are very accurate (yes, even Ichigo's, ignore the reviewers claiming he gets a different sword - the iconic one he's constantly shown with was not the first one he ended up with, and that first sword is what's used here). Rukia's glove and many other things are exactly like the manga.Set - 9/10 Rather than waste the tiny budget this film had in exactly reproducing floorplans and sets (a mere 3.5 million, which is nothing in terms of filmmaking on this level), things are made to feel similar. Ichigo's room is not laid out exactly the same as the manga/anime, but it still has a bed, desk, closet for Rukia to hide in, etc. and feels like Ichigo's room. Same with the Kurosaki household - it feels convincing, if not exactly the same as the manga showed it.Fights: 9.5/10 There are so many good moments here I can't list them all. Is there some visible wire-fu jumping at points? Yes. Does it ruin the action? No, it's no worse than some of the jumps Captain America made in a few films (you know, where they land far too lightly and stiffly to be actually ""falling/landing""?) The Hollows look less cartoonishly simple and more menacing, yet they still have the same mechanics (Cero, claws, medusa-like fur). At one point Ichigo's sword gets stuck in the ground and Renji RUNS UP THE BLADE EDGE and attacks. The swordplay is fantastic.Seriously, give it a chance. There is enough here to please all but the hardcore sticklers (who were never really going to like anything made on less than a Marvel Avengers budget). I was pleasantly surprised, and the movie feels enough like falling in love with the series all over again that I keep going back. I've never dropped $60 and counting on tickets for one movie, especially not an anime adaptation. GO SEE IT!",positive
Alan Partridge,"As I watched this on my trip to London and have no previous connection to Alan Partridge I cannot judge this against the series, as another reviewer has done already (at least). I can say that I like Steve Coogan a lot, which was one of the main reasons I wanted to see it. And he is a very funny guy. The premise itself has some very funny moments indeed, though it sometimes goes sour in a heartbeat (for all the wrong reasons that is).The movie is somewhat based in reality, but it's an Alan Partridge reality. Still there are too many things that are convenient and most of it is really predictable. Weren't it for the charm of the lead actors and their playing of the roles, I think many more would notice that this runs out of steam quickly (story wise). The finale then is very weird (with police acting even weirder, passive/active wise that is) ... a shorter version would've been much appreciated.",negative
Alan Partridge,"Now let me get this straight. I'm not Alan Partridge. I didn't decide one Monday afternoon, while eating a double decker, to come on to IMDb and give a review. That would be illegal. Neither am I plugging double deckers. They're really nice though, and I reckon Jesus would probably eat them. I digress. Alpha Papa is amazing. Alan Partridge will surely get the Oscar nod for best actor. If you thought Brokeback Mountain was stunning (I didn't) then you'll bend over backwards to watch this. Alan doesn't play a gay cowboy, but rather a non-gay radio show presenter who ends up in a siege (sorry about the spoiler). And he doesn't die at the end either like Bruce Willis in Sixth Sense, or the dog in Bob Marley and Me. No, he lives after enduring what can only be described as an epic battle of man versus another slightly crazy man, who looks a bit like that bloke off Star Trek with the fake Irish accent. Anyway...don't waste your time watching Monsters University or the slightly camp Wolverine who has knives and forks for hands. Watch a real man in action giving the performance of his life.",positive
Parallels,"This movie is stupid. It is an insult to sci-fi fans, an insult to people who like comic books, art of any kind, intelligent conversation, good TV, decent movies, and anything ever created by human kind that had a modicum of talent or thought invested in it. Watch it only to scream at the inane characters. Watch it to roll your eyes at the banal plot points. Or do as I did, and laugh uncontrollably at the terrible dialogue. ""Says the mute,"" is the j'accuse of this film's invented universe, a universe best described as a schlocky tick-tocky time waste. You may not believe that man has evolved from apes, readers, but believe me when I tell you that we would all be better off picking fleas from each other's pelts than watching this film.*** Edit June 8, 2015*** A great sci-fi movie is difficult to create. I appreciate the people who try - even though I could not stand this piece.",negative
Parallels,"It's not perfect but it deserves my ten stars because I really want it to continue. In contrary to many other TV-series (I suppose this is a pilot of a series?) I think that ""Parallels"" must have been made by people that really like what they do. The main characters feels almost as Real People, not just actors doing their work. Of course this is not the Oscar league, please understand that I'm comparing to similar productions.The plot is far from novel: We have the involuntary protagonists, a phenomenon with a vessel that uses the phenomenon, a couple of persons with unknown objectives, and an abundance of different world settings. But the ingredients are well cooked into a delicious taste. This is a ""what if"" story with a thriller, not a ""it's like this"" with BangBoom in the lead.No mind-boggling stuff... Well, it would be if it happened to me, but as a watcher I'm carefully taken through the loops and I can forgive the few plot holes I noticed. The feeling I get is that this is made with intelligence, it has been given more than a half thought!And it has humor! Not much but just enough.When I left ""Fringe"" I felt sad for a long time. Now I'm happy again, I hope this new affair will continue!",positive
Knights of Badassdom,"This was one of the biggest let downs of recent memory. After reading all of the positive reviews, and seeing the incredibly high rating, I really thought I would be in for a treat. The movie wasn't funny, except for a few mild smiles here and there. The special effects, especially towards the end, were atrocious. And the characters were wooden with nothing brought to the screen. And the main premise for the demon was a cringe worthy rip off of the Necronomicon from Evil Dead. The movie has a incredible cast with Peter Dinklage, Summer Glau, Ryan Kwanten, and Steve Zahn. But unfortunately they totally failed to use almost any of their characters to their full (or any) potential. Ryan Kwanten was the only one who was even half way interesting. There were countless times that they could have made something humorous, or even hysterical, but instead it fell totally flat and was just bland. (Where was them humor after the games began and they set it up so obviously for Dinklage?!) I can understand fans of larping enjoying this film, as that unique aspect was the only half way saving grace of this snore-fest. But I can't imagine anyone else could even find it more than mildly entertaining. 3/10 stars and that's being generous.",negative
Knights of Badassdom,"I was extremely lucky to attend the world premiere! The screening was held at the ""Icon"" festival (sort of the Israeli version of comic-con) in Tel-Aviv, Israel. The screening began at midnight on the night of Sep. 24-25 2013. The movie was introduced by one of the producers. She got on stage, said a few words about the film and then dropped the bomb on all of us - This was the world premiere! The theater ERUPTED! Clapping and hooting for a good 2 minutes before she could keep on talking.What can I say? It was a theater packed with geeks and everyone went wild! the film is fantastic! The cast is brilliant and I laughed out loud at least 20 times (Even though on this page it doesn't say that the movie is actually a comedy - it totally is!). People were even clapping and cheering at many key moments. The feeling in the room was electric. We don't know which cut we got to see though, but it didn't feel too long - just right, in fact. Peter Dinklage is wonderful as usual and Summer Glau's performance - she was was fantastic. She is every geek's wet dream of course.. But she really delivered the whole ""I'm not really into this but I'm playing along with it"" role. She looked amazing in her costume! Her on screen chemistry with the other characters was excellent. She is definitely one of the underrated actresses out there.The film itself has some great plot twists and even though it had a very low budget - it manages to escape the feel of a B-movie. It even had some pretty good CGI animation. At the end everyone was clapping and as I walked out of the theater, feeling giddy - EVERYONE was smiling, laughing, reminiscing and all in all I didn't hear a single person saying anything negative about it. The only reason this film gets a 9 is because a 10 is reserved for maybe 5- 10 movies in my life. If you are a geek, were a geek, or simply have a little bit of geekyness in you - don't hesitate when it is released - it's worth every penny! Go with friends who appreciate this kind of stuff. I was never much of a role-playing fan and still felt completely connected to this film. Well done!!",positive

Singularity,"This film is so bad I can't even be bothered stringing how much I hate this film into cogent sentences.So, 97 years after the bots take over you're telling me that the windows on the shops are crystal clean? You're telling me that despite no new clothes being manufactured the human characters look like they've just got a whole new wardrobe from GAP? That nearly 100 years of neglect has seen no collapsed roofs, no weeds growing from gutters, and fields that look like they've been fallow for a couple of years? That street signs, railings, window shutters, metal roll shutters have absolutely no signs of rust? That despite the bot driven apocalypse, the main female lead still has time to obviously dye her hair? In the scenes running through forests, they follow well worn and undergrowth free paths.... worn and maintained by whom exactly? Bots? In one of the opening scenes, a shop is engulfed in ivy inside yet in one of the later scenes, a house described as 'really old' has perfectly white whitewashed walls, and inside looks pristine - photographs aren't faded, glass cabinets haven't a speck of dust on them... in fact there is no dust, not even a cob web! And given that the house hasn't been heated for 97 years, it's amazing that there is no damp whatsoever. 97 year old Polaroid film works and, it must be energizer, because the batteries are still fresh. Despite being out in the wilds for days on end the male lead is always perfectly cleanly shaven. Even when he is woken from sleep he has been mysteriously shaved - then again he is a robot - a fact that the writers are at pains to have us aware of from the outset with the laboured 'no food for me' scene - funny then that when the girl falls asleep on his chest she doesn't notice that he doesn't need to breathe (we presume) And then, when they meet some nasty humans, they are all covered in stubble, dirt and worn clothes - oh my, so original.The male lead gets tied up in a brand spanking new rope. I mean, this thing clearly was just bought from a shop on the day... and the rope magically moves from one scene to the next... did they take lunch in the middle of shooting the 'tied up in brand new rope' scenes? Maybe they should have...The male lead is only capable of two expressions - eyes normal and eyes bursting out of his head. There is nothing in between and the rest of his face is entirely pointless. Lucky for him that the dialogue doesn't require much else. Actually, I'm not giving him credit... he can do a variation on these two expressions above including with mouth open and with mouth shut.The female lead should take urgent note that crying involves water coming from the eyes. You can't snivel and gasp for air, and then expect to look authentic with a perfectly dry face. Special effects are dire - in the opening scenes burning buildings look like someone went mad with the Photoshop clone tool. Explosions don't cast any light on objects that are close by and clouds of dense smoke don't cast any shadows and dissipate in moments leaving no trace. Enormous bots appear to defy the laws of physics and move through dense forestry without causing a single tree to move. 'Whats in your chest' scene - great work on the 97 year old straw bales that look to have been made in the last week... and the plentiful fresh straw on the ground in the barn... just lazy... Lighting.... I mean really.... what is happening with the lighting? In a dark and dingy forest, and it looks like two blazing follow spots behind the cameras.... just cheap and nasty.The characters are so poorly developed that their behaviour is schizophrenic at best.Continuity is a joke - in the opening scenes we see buildings burnt to to the ground, yet in later scenes, and I mean 97 years later scenes, they are visible in the background, with lights on inside. Really, 97 years after the rise of the bots, they are still using lights? Who is changing the bulbs? Bot janitor? Who even makes the bulbs?The bots themselves. If you're looking for humans, perhaps IR might be better than visible light to detect them? I think it's utterly lazy that the main feature of the film, that drives the whole storyline, the bots, are so poor.After leaving the 'facility' (you just know that's what they call it), they walk through a field of corn ready to be harvested. I'm feeling like a stuck record here...John Cusack must have been desperate for the cash.",negative
Singularity,"No logic, no sense, no feelings, no action. The sounds are surprisingly bad, conversations are full of cliché. Neither director nor actors should be proud of this work. I'm sure it could be done much better with minor changes to scenario and at least some effort! While I was watching this, I was stunned by the stupidity of lead characters and absence of logic in most of the scenes. Seems like this work was made for a certain kind of people. To hurt them.",positive
The Young and Prodigious T.S. Spivet,"all style no substance - this is how one could sum up this movie. the visual style in general and the colors in particular are awesome, and only serve to make the movies already splendid scenery even more impressive.however, there is no substance to be supported by these nice visuals. the story is neither realistic, nor funny, nor emotional, nor interesting. i had simply no idea what to do with this movie.furthermore, it suffers from the typical fate of child-centered movies: bad child actors, even though its hard to see how better actors could have helped, since all the characters in the movie are completely unrealistic 2d-stereotypes anywaysmaybe this is enjoyable in theaters for the visuals alone, but as a movie, and not a showpiece of color filters and nice scenery, it fails completely",negative
The Young and Prodigious T.S. Spivet,"Like the perpetual motion of multiple exits, the story is almost completely psychedelic. However, there are quarrels in warmth, happiness in troubles, growth in sorrows, mesmerizing scenery, paired with strong contrasting colors, slow plots, and various small fantasy adjustments to weave together a Fairytales for all ages.",positive
New World,"what a great Korean movie! the screenplay is shockingly and amazingly good. the scenario, the twists of the plots...OMG, just like a Russian artifact egg, so many smaller eggs one after another hidden inside another; a perfect onion, so many layers inside one after another, so subtly and so purposely wrapped each other. this is by far the most fantastic undercover film ever made after 'the infernal affair' and the adaptation 'the departed'. the special effects and the stunt of this film are also top notched. thank god there's no disgusting overly used visual effects done by computer, but more convincing stunts. the performances of all the actors, female or male, are also did great jobs. pay attention to the guy who played with the plant leaves, broken it, then sneakly turned the vase around a little bit to hide the broken leaf, that scene, well, was so good. the twists of the plot would make you sit up a bit straighter to the edge of your sofa or chair, 'cause it's that thrilling and suspenseful. love this movie and Hollywood, just give me a break, will you guys, don't adapt it into an inferior film again.",negative
New World,"'New World' is an epic gangster film from South Korean director, Park Hoon-jung. With actors such as Choi Min-sik (probably most well known for his role as Dae-su in 'Oldboy'), I was expecting this film to deliver something spectacular. And, well, it did. For the duration of the narrative, I could not tear my eyes away from the screen. While the pace of most films of this length tends to slow, or get a little dull, 'New World' kept a steady rhythm, full of political intrigue.Undercover cop, Ja-seong (played by Lee Jeong-jae), leads a dual life. He has his job as a policeman, and the role of a gangster in a large crime syndicate that goes under the name of 'Goldmoon.' When the boss of the syndicate is killed in a car accident, Chief Kang (Choi Min- sik) puts a new project into effect called 'Operation New World'. The purpose of this operation is to ensure that one of the undercover cops in the syndicate will rise to a position of power. The ultimate aim is for the syndicate to be in the hands of, or at least easily manipulated by, a trusted law enforcer.Ja-seong finds himself torn between his duties as a cop, and his loyalties to 'brother,' and gang member, Jung Chung (Hwang Jung-min). Putting more hours, and more effort into his work, Ja-seong finds less time at home with his pregnant wife, and more into the syndicate 'family'. Acting as a bridge between the law, and the underworld, the loyalty of Ja-seong is rarely questioned by his acquaintances. Yet, it is apparent that Ja-seong beings to question the nature of loyalty, and of betrayal. As he prepares to dive further into the syndicate, his confusion becomes ever more apparent. Some of the conversations in 'New World' were gripping, and the portrayal of violent acts was just spectacular. The use of blood in these instances, paired with close ups, were some of the most aesthetically pleasing moments in the film. While not extremely violent, 'New World' uses violence in a manner that complements the pace of the film. The ruthless nature of the law, and the syndicate, was highlighted in these instances, and it is apparent that both sides can be as manipulative, and as corrupt, as one other. All the while, in the midst of this corruption, Ja-seong must find a place of power to call his own; he must create a whole new world.",positive
Kill Command,"Mind the spoiler alert.So we have a group of soldiers send to a training island to test their skills against their replacements aka droids. Because there is an excessive amount of data being learned by the droids the tech girl who designed and programmed them is send along with them to asses the product.They easily take out some old versions and think they're done. All the wile outwards communication is being blocked but they don't seem to mind that and just stand around a lot. Don't get me wrong the movie is quite decent, way better than most of the other ""low budget"" sci-fi creations.Anyhow here are a few things I didn't like about the movie. The girl/creator is way to silent. Even when it's abundantly clear something is wrong she still keeps quiet wile all the information they can get would have been helpful. Mayor annoyance.At some point they walk into the storage facility for the droids not activated at that time. Did they turn this into an advantage, NO! They could have destroyed them as all of them are equipped with a self-destruct EMP bomb to prevent their tech from falling into enemy hands.Or better jet as the creator is there with them she could have disconnected them from the network and given them a command to protect the humans. Did I mention she has a chip in her head/neck that gives her the ability to interact with those droids through a neural interface. So something like that really shouldn't have been hard to do and would have made it a much more realistic final battle if you have a good portion of the enemy taken out and then some left to battle by human hands.For some reason 1 of the droids is the boss. Even though they're networked and at some point 3 of the same boss type droids are activated. Anyway they salvage an EMP bomb from one of the destroyed droids somehow up it's power (don't ask how) and manage to take the boss out. Sacrificing herself as her chip gets affected too. But guess what that thing made to take out the tech to prevent it from falling into enemy hands doesn't work the boss gets up again and now goes after the creator who plays dead and then blasts a hole though it's head. Then her chip gives out completely and she dies. Guess what happens next, the darn boss droid gets up again and manages with his last ""breath"" to upload itself into her destroyed chip!? So quite a bit of ridiculousness at the end and if that wasn't bad enough it also leaves an open ending. No one likes those, hell personally that's for a large part why I don't watch horror flicks anymore as they nearly always end without an end.",negative
Kill Command,"""Kill Command"" resembles another glossy movie from last decade; ""Final Fantasy: The Spirit Within"" in both positive and negative ways. Story follows a female specialist and a group of soldiers as they are trying to figure out the secretive nature of their enemy, in this case a horde of combat machine. The movie looks good even though the narrative might feel stale as it progresses sluggishly.Its most valuable asset is certainly its graphic, the effects are riveting and it brings out the sci-fi aspect really well. Camera angles are done to accommodate the sequences between humans and machines, even if there's slight editing twitch, the graphic is a solid feature. Cinematography and color tone work fine to present a secluded setting, both the contrasting outdoor nature and futuristic hallways or rooms. Audience would clearly see the near-future vibe it aims for.Unfortunately, story moves in sloppy march. It has a good mystery aspect, but nearly everything is repetitive in motion. It doesn't give clear characterization either beyond the gifted girl wanting to understand the situation while the soldiers just want to survive and get the mission done. Acting is presentable only to that effect. It seems that it could fit more, or tidy up some scenes to shorten the length in favor of more content.As a sci-fi ""Kill Command"" delivers a fine visual despite its by-the-number narrative. It's enough to separate itself from the horde and a decent foundation for a thriller.",positive
Turbo Kid,"Let's make a movie about the future, but set it in the past and make it look like it was set even further in the past. That could've been the pitch for ""Turbo Kid"" (NR, 1:33) – and that's just one of many interesting and unusual things that there are to learn about this film even before discussing what it's about. For one thing, it's a co-production of Canada and New Zealand. Since it's technically a foreign film, it has no MPAA rating (but if it did, it would surely be rated ""R""). The movie has three directors, François Simard, Anouk Whissell and Yoann-Karl Whissell, all three of which also share credit for the screenplay, and all appear in the movie in small roles. What's more, the cinematographer, Jean-Philippe Bernier, is also one of the two people who did the film's score, which is a highly unusual combination of jobs. Now, let's get back to that highly unusual pitch summary in the first sentence of this paragraph.""Turbo Kid"" is a post-apocalyptic action movie set in the ""future"" year of 1997. That actually makes sense when you know that the film intentionally looks and sounds like it was made in the early 1980s. Stating it another way, this movie is ""retro futuristic"". It's a lot like many of the movies made in the late 70s and early 80s. In fact, the year picked for the story's setting, 1997, is the same year in which 1981's classic dystopian action thriller ""Escape from New York"" takes place. And that's not the only connection between other movies of this film's sub-genre. There are passing verbal references and visuals that are subtle shout-outs to movies like ""Soylent Green"" and ""The Terminator"". What's not so subtle is the strong and obvious influence of another post-apocalyptic film series from the 1980s (rebooted in 2015) on the plot, setting and costumes in this movie. As ""Wired"" magazine said, it's ""'Mad Max' on a BMX"".Munro Chambers plays a character simply called ""The Kid"", an orphaned teen just trying to survive in a land laid waste by something (?) which led to the end of civilized society. The Kid scavenges items that he can ""sell"" to his world's version of a pawn broker (Romano Ozari) for that most precious of commodities – water. The water that exists is under the control of a sadistic general called Zeus (Michael Ironside). As he brags to his ""minions"" (NOT the cute kind), he not only provides their liquid sustenance, but their entertainment as well. He sponsors regular violent and bloody gladiatorial-like contests between his ""henchmen"" (better word) and those unfortunate enough to have double-crossed Zeus or just crossed his path.When he's not scavenging, The Kid is obsessing over his favorite superhero, someone called ""Turbo Rider"". The Kid has various Turbo Rider memorabilia in his house and then gets a hold of an old Turbo Rider comic book, which he seems to value almost as much as staying hydrated. As he's sitting in an old playground reading his comic book aloud to himself, he's approached by a girl named Apple (played by Canadian actress Laurence Leboeuf) who wants to be friends. She's impossibly chipper (either gratingly or adorably, depending on your point of view) and she may or may not be a cold-blooded killer. But she insists on hanging out with The Kid, and, well, friends are hard to come by in this terrible future-past (or is it past-future?), so he lets her tag along as he scavenges.As dangerous as this time and place is, you have to be tough to survive. The Kid teaches Apple his rules for survival and soon the two of them meet someone even tougher than The Kid – a cowboy type named Frederic (Aaron Jeffery) who's an arm-wrestling champion and the closest thing that the few decent people left alive have to a protector. That is, until The Kid becomes Turbo Kid. He finds a costume that makes him look and feel like his hero, Turbo Man. The costume doesn't help him fly or anything, but it does have a pretty serious weapon built into one of the arms. The Kid becomes Turbo Kid just in the nick of time. For different reasons, Apple and Frederic both run afoul of Zeus and they need some serious turbo-charged rescuing! But even if Turbo Kid can free his only two friends from the clutches of Zeus, he'd likely be pretty ticked off and would probably want to hunt them down and, you know, kill them all.It's kind of a tough thing to judge this movie. On the one hand, it is very effective at evoking the feeling of cheesy early-80s future schlock. On the other hand, the violence (albeit comic violence) can be a bit excessive – unless you find dismemberment and gallons of fake blood shooting everywhere to be amusing. Still, the graphic destruction of so many human bodies notwithstanding, this movie deserves credit for being very different from any other 2015 release and it is more entertaining than not. All this comes out to a mild recommendation – with a strong warning. Considering all the blood and guts, a kids' movie this is not, but adults (especially those who like the cheesier movies of the 70s and 80s, and enjoy a good splatter flick) may find seeing ""Turbo Kid"" to be a blast. This B-movie gets a ""B"".",negative
Turbo Kid,"If your primary movie-going experience is watching Hollywood blockbusters with vin diesel, this may not be your cup of tea, but for everyone else, this film destroys it.This film is pure gold, 80's indulgent, brain melting gore, a love story, and even somewhat artistic at times.I won't drone on, but this film i destined to be a staple in horror/art house/comedy cinema.It is fast-paced, adorable, hilarious, brutal, and has a charm that only filmmakers in love with their genres can produce. This is not Hollywood, but you wouldn't know it. Often times I can either purchase a film to see it, or watch it streaming but, it's a rare occasion when i see a film and have to instantly purchase it.",positive
The Fury of a Patient Man,"Generally two things happen in a compelling revenge film. First we feel the agony that the character went through, and we can't wait for them to exact their revenge. Then when the character actually goes through with their plan of revenge, we get a sense of satisfaction, when at least some justice is served. This film is a BIG swing and miss on both.The pacing is very slow throughout the entirety of the film. The silver lining is that it is only an hour and a half. And I didn't waste anymore time on what was pure boredom watching this.",negative
The Fury of a Patient Man,"Kept me on the edge. Tense and well acted. I love Spanish cinema, hardly ever disappoints. Recommend to watch.",positive
The Machine,"The Machine is a rather successful attempt at implementing hard science fiction tendencies with a cyberpunk aesthetic. It may not be particularly adroit in terms of human and AI relationships, but I appreciate the rigor of the scientific explanation for the artificial intelligence. The film really excels at this in the beginning when Vincent conducts his own Turing tests as part of a secret headhunting operation. Then as he meets Ava things start taking a problematic turn. The military-industrial complex is invoked, but its purpose is sort of shadowy and never is contextualized in a way that would make the narrative more coherent.The questioning of human identity is the strongest point of the film, but I suppose that, at the very core, this film was more interested in being a thriller, rather than an exploration of the philosophical concepts.",negative
The Machine,"I actually enjoyed this film more than I thought I would, although the first half-hour didn't really work on me. I could see the low-budget in the initial shots. Because of this, I wasn't fully paying attention. However, I kept finding that I needed to keep rewinding to check out what I missed since the plot was actually moving along quite fast.Then at about the half-hour point, this movie really captured and kept my attention throughout. I really like the acting and the way the lead actress moved (including her dance and combat movements).As for scenes, the interior shots were set up well. The dark lighting was really effective and the eye glows worked very well. Editing was actually pretty quick and the story was compelling. I was actually concerned for the characters (which doesn't seem to happen for me very often in movies today).One of the real standouts is the visual effects work. It's phenomenal (especially considering the low budget). The intro credits look fantastic, the robot-creation sequence is just amazing, and the glow effect on the robot was pretty phenomenal. I have a feeling that the VFX teams did some serious overtime on this one. I also suspect the effects houses didn't make much on this production although I suspect the shots they did will make great portfolio material.If I had a qualm with this movie, it's the soundtrack. On one hand, it uses very cool CS80 sounds, similar to Blade Runner. Unfortunately the shots that used this instrument didn't have the 'weight' to warrant that sound. Believe me, I love that synth, but it needs to be used strategically. Then there's the other style of music which is typical of movies like Her or Ex Machina. I didn't think that score worked particularly well either. Perhaps something in-between the two styles would have worked better. The Blade Runner style was more mysterious and haunting than this film's presentation and the more modern score was too light and nondescript for the shots it was attached to. Regardless, there were sections of music that did work nicely. I seem to recall the music near the end of the film being spot-on.In general, this is a film that I can recommend to people who like science fiction and the topic of A.I., androids, cyborgs, etc.... It's actually quite a thoughtful film. Interestingly, I found that I prefer this movie over both Her and Ex Machina.",positive
Stalingrad,"Seriously, why is almost every scene in this movie using slow motion? This one visual trick screwed up the film's pacing and tension so badly that whatever else might've been there couldn't have saved it. Slow motion is usually used to amplify powerful scenes, not to blanket the whole movie with it. It can obviously enhance a scene in a movie if used sparingly but the filmmakers really went comically overboard with its use in this one. The movie's laughably propagandistic sentimentality does it no favors either though I guess Bondarchuck's pal Putin might appreciate it (Bondarchuck has publicly supported Putin's moves in Crimea and otherwise).The script and the dialogue were absolutely terrible and cringe-worthy. Who actually speaks in those propagandistic terms? They also set up the characters so badly, I could scarcely remember anyone's name and didn't care about any of them. They're ridiculous caricatures with no humanity behind them and their actions are illogical and baffling most of the time. The characterizations are so minimal you'd struggle to see them with a microscope. The setup in the beginning and the narration overall didn't work either, I mean was that Russian aid worker really telling the story of the bloodiest battle in human history to a group of scared German girls trapped under ruins? Way to depress them even further. The movie wasn't really about Stalingrad either but about this hastily put together group of soldiers defending some random building in Stalingrad. You could've transplanted them to any other random battle and nothing would've changed. There's the Barmaley statue of the dancing children and boats crossing the Volga to remind you it's actually Stalingrad but that's about it. If they chose this as the film's context then the movie should've been about resilience and brotherhood but none of that was to be found. Instead the film's focus was on the explosions and slow-motion combat. Michael Bay would surely be proud. I have to say I did get a few laughs from the movie though. When the few defenders of the building suddenly decide to storm out of their defensive positions à la 300 and when a gun crew manages to bank a shell off the armor of a broken T-34 to a German position around the corner, I just couldn't contain myself. I don't think the filmmakers intended those scenes to be funny though so make of that what you will.",negative
Stalingrad,"This is the third best movie on the battle of Stalingrad since 1993. OK, to my knowledge, there have been just three Stalingrad movies in that span of time. This movie follows in an unfortunate trend among newer Russian war movies to sport lame plots, odd plot devices, and weak direction. Technically, it is nicely done with great sets and realistic uniforms, but unfortunately, it has a tepid story, unengaging main characters (OK, captain Kahn and Masha were somewhat engaging), dull musical score, and slow motion in Every. Frigging. Scene. Hey, it worked in ""Cross of Iron"" because Peckinpah used it for effect, not as an excuse for lame action. Here, it robs the battle scenes of the intensity most war movies get right.From what I've seen of newer Russian war movies, about one in ten is really good. This one ranks among the nine others.",positive
Baahubali 2: The Conclusion,"Finally sat down to write the review of this over-hyped trash. Saw this with my friends in a theatre. I was never a fan of the first part. It was pure cartoonish n bad movie. Was not keen on watching the 2nd but sometimes u cant deny ur pals. The only reason i am writing a review of this trash is to let my anger out. The story of this movie is so lame that at times i felt m i watching an 80s bollywood crap. The hero is shown as the best human being without any shades of grey. Basically there was zero effort in the screenplay. Lets come to the acting. Inspite of the movie being 3 hrs long, there is zero character development. The lead actor, Prabhas is pathetic. The expressions n mannerisms aint convincing. The editing is the worst. Most of us started fiddling with our fones. Ther r unnecessary scenes which jus drags on. Cinematography in this movie is awful. The direction is very amateurish. The director didn't know how to create tension or get the best outta his cast n crew. Coming to the vfx of this movie, i found it to be cartoonish n very silly. The scene where Baahubali uses coconut trees as an infiltrating object for his army to get on top of the fort wud be remembered as the most unintentional comedic scene. Some of the video games n animated movies r much better than this trash. So many arrows are fired yet Bahubali gets away easily. The river dam scene is a big wtf.Regarding originality n creativity:
Straight away copied from 300, Game of Thrones, Superman vs Batman, Ong bak, Hercules, Troy, The Mummy, Wonder woman, etc.
The first part of this lousy film copied the poster of Simon Birch.",negative
Baahubali 2: The Conclusion,"Why so much hatred on this movie. I wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1-star ratings. I'm surprised not even single point they liked in this movie. This means when you keep negativity in mind everything looks negative. The sheer collections of this movie in India alone prove how much this movie liked by common movie lover. People who are saying this movie collections are just because of the hype should remember no movie in the world wins the box office just through the hype or publicity. The hype is good for the first day or weekend collections, but once the movie is out only the content wins at the box office. In fact, many times too much hype damages collections if the movie is not up to the mark. I can give you few examples. The Indian superstar Rajinikanth's movie Kabali hyped so high than any movie in India before and not even Baahubali 1 had that much hype. That hype helped to get unimaginable records on the first day and the first weekend, however, the content of the movie is not justifiable over the hype so it just collapsed at the box office. There are plenty of examples like this; another example is South Indian director Shankar's film 'I'. Where Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger came to India to attend the audio function and that created so much buzz. But everyone knows what the result of that movie at the end. Therefore the point is just with hype and publicity no one can make movie run in long run. Also no director in the world can make a movie which satisfies all audiences. Not even James Cameron. When his latest movie Avatar got released there were plenty of people who did not like the movie(IMDb rating 7.8). People questioned what is there in that movie other than spectacle VFX. That is not James Cameron best works compare to his previous movies Titanic, Terminator 2 etc. However, the majority of the people around the world embraced that movie and made it the biggest blockbuster ever in Hollywood film industry. When you are rating this movie keep your negativity aside and watch again, think for a second why Baahubali 2 is able to achieve mind-boggling collections and able to run successfully for 50 days in 1050 centers. If there is nothing in this movie how it would collect that much. Think hard! You will realize the greatness of this movie. If you still not satisfied at least appreciate people's hard work that put their heart and soul in this movie for 5 years. Finally, my review of this movie is as follows.It is most engaging, gripping, jaw-dropping movie that I've seen in recent times. I bet you will get Goosebumps while watching some of the scenes (guaranteed). I've known Rajamouli since his first movie. His biggest strength is his screenplay and emotional drama. He told in many interviews what is his success mantra. 1. Elevation scenes: He ensures there is at least one peak/elevation scene in every ten or 15 minutes of the movie even story won't allow for such scenes. IMO this is one of the reasons he takes more time to make movies as to conceive each such scene is not an easy job. This will keep you engaged throughout the movie without any dull movement. If you think the movie as a two-dimensional graph, his movies are like a sine wave except there are no negative values, only positive values occasionally rise to the peak. Keep this point in mind and watch Baahubali 1 and 2. There is always one or two elevation scene(s) in every 10 or 15 minutes. Especially in Baahubali 2, you forget to take the breath! The screenplay is so tight and engaging.2. Emotional drama: He is a true master in emotional drama. The scenes that lead to Kattapa killing Baahubali are an emotional roller coaster. The drama between each of the lead characters is top notch.3. The villain character: Almost in all his movies villain character is more dominant, powerful, charming, intelligent than a hero. He creates more scenes to establish villain. The point here is, the impact that this build-up creates when hero defeats indisputable villain is terrific. Even in Baahubali 2, the villain character is so powerful sometimes you feel it is impossible to defeat him. Overall it's an eye feast to watch this movie. If possible watch it in IMAX or 4K screen. Thanks to Rajamouli for giving such a wonderful masterpiece.",positive
Wolf Creek 2,"Just last month, Stephen King wrote the following on his Twitter page: ""Horror is when you know and love the characters, but you also know something very bad is going to happen to them. It's not the monsters!"" And you see his point: In order to make horror films truly scary, we must feel afraid for the characters because we truly care for them. We want them to make it out alive. We want them to succeed. This isn't only exclusive to horror films. It applies to every film. If we don't care for the characters, why should we care about the story? What WOLF CREEK 2 and most horror films get wrong is how they couldn't care less for its characters.In WOLF CREEK 2, director Greg Mclean is all for the monster, and this is unfortunate because the monster isn't the hero of the story. He's just a evil figure lurking in the shadows ready to kill anyone that comes his way with some one-liners to shout throughout the film. He has no depth, no layers and neither do the protagonists, which makes it hard to sit through the film feeling anything but anger. All you're left with are set pieces with gore and gratuitous violence thrown on screen, but you don't feel anything because you just don't care.This is what separates good recent horror films like OCULUS and THE CONJURING from WOLF CREEK 2. And it's not to say Mclean isn't capable of making quality horror films. After all, he directed ROGUE, a monster flick that actually focuses on its characters and not the monster itself. It is no surprise to learn, then, that ROGUE is enjoyed more considerably than Mclean's WOLF CREEK films (ROGUE currently stands at a rare 100% on RottenTomatoes). Mclean attempts to flesh out the monster in WOLF CREEK 2, but he spends just 5 minutes to establish that Mick Taylor is a bigot and then continuously pounds the audience in the head about this fact through the rest of the film.As for the protagonists themselves, it doesn't get any better. They are useless, clueless, and uninteresting. I'm sorry, but in this day and age, giving the characters a significant other just doesn't cut it, even when they're heard off screen. More characters appear as the film goes along, but we quickly find out they're there to die a few minutes later, often in gruesome and unpleasant ways. And don't get me started on the female characters. Are we still in the era where all they do is stay on the sidelines and scream helplessly? Aren't we passed that? Or a better question might be SHOULDN'T we be passed that? Regardless, the characters should have been handled better, but it's clear the director was more interested in building a legacy for Mick Taylor to stand beside the likes of Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, and Michael Myers than creating real, sympathetic characters to root for.I despised this film. I despised the senseless violence, the two dimensional characters, and the villain. WOLF CREEK 2 is a perfectly packaged product of what's wrong with modern horror films. It's a string of bloody set pieces barely held together by a script (if that). It's not even fun to sit through in a so-bad-it's-good kind of way. Well, maybe except for the scene involving CGI kangaroos. However, if you're the type of person who wants to cheer for the monster, then so be it. I just wished director Greg Mclean would make more films like ROGUE than continuing to build his WOLF CREEK franchise.",negative
Wolf Creek 2,"Many people were hugely disappointed by the original Wolf Creek, largely because it sold itself as the most terrifying film ever made which turned out to be nonsense. I ordered the unrated version online here in the UK because I wanted to see it in full (I have an intense hatred for all things BBFC) but even that was limp and uneven. That said, the tourist hating killer within definitely had something going for him, and I wasn't totally adverse to watching him again on a second outing, so it was with some low expectations I approached WC2, and my was I pleasantly surprised. . . It looks as if they had a major rethink of the film this time, and while there was some humour in part one, this time it's amped up to ten. I laughed many many times at the (dark) comedy Wolf Creek has now become - but this may depend on what your sense of humour is like (mine's a little twisted) as the laughs always accompany some gory scenes. There are one liners while a penis is lopped off, where a field of kangaroos get wiped out, some Germans get offed, and as fingers are removed with a grinder, it's bloody fantastic. And the previous attempt at being all serious has been left behind with fun being the driving force now. Honestly this is the most fun flick I've seen this year, and after 3 viewings it didn't lose its charm. I know many horror fans will probably avoid this movie because of being let down by part one, but you'll be missing a true gem this time. Check it out, a new horror anti hero is born.",positive
Everly,"... that has confounded IMDb members since the inception of the site.Namely, why does the IMDb permit a rating of only ""1"" if they don't intend anyone to ever choose it? The obvious answer is that, they do indeed intend for this rating to be used, but the challenge is to find a film that justifies it.And with EVERLY I think we finally hit the jackpot.Start with (what I am assuming to be a FORMERLY) A-List actress and put her in a film that looks like it was written and produced and directed by a bunch of high schoolers who combined their allowances to produce something that would get them an interview with the Admissions Officer at a third rate film school.Not actually joking here. The bio of the director, as explained on the IMDb, tells us that he currently has more acting credits than directing credits (think about that for a moment) and that he started his career by taping two cameras together so he could make new films by editing other people's already-made films. Think about that too.As one might expect from this kind of film, it uses every trick known to keep costs down. Like no dialog for the first 10 minutes. No obvious plot. People enter the scenes randomly and either try to kill the star or are killed themselves.Strange lighting. Fast cuts. Lots of reaction shots (mainly Selma).In other words, anything to ""work around"" the usual ingredients of a film. Like a plot, a story, continuity, and other actors with dialog.A mainstream review I read (just to sure I was actually watching the finished film and not the dailies, or possibly a workprint) said that it is films like this that make us revere the genius of Tarantino.I have no comment on that.

Everly,"Smokin' Aces + Kill Bill + Dredd = EverlyI found out about Everly late last year because of Fantastic Fest, and I've been pretty excited about it. It's about a woman faces down assassins sent by her ex, a mob boss, while holed up in her apartment - which sounded pretty similar to two movies I loved in 2012 (Dredd and The Raid: Redemption), and the pictures I saw during post made it look like a lot of fun.Selma Hayek plays the titular Everly, a Mexican prostitute. At 48, she looks great, and I haven't seen her kick ass like this since Desperado. She's the sole focus here, but some of the side characters are pretty interesting. My favorite was a character named Sadist, an old Japanese speaking psycho with some tricks in his bag. It's directed by Joe Lynch, a pretty small time filmmaker best known for directing Wrong Turn 2.Everly isn't going to win any awards for it's story. It's as one dimensional at best, and still manages to make little sense at times. It often falls into action movie tropes like bad guys hesitating to talk before pulling the trigger (of course leading to their demise), something that disappointed me seeing that Lynch was brought up on a steady diet of B-movies. Everly does bring one thing to the table though, and that is a hell of a lot of fun. There's no skimping on the blood here, people are shot, sliced, and blown up in all it's gory glory. There's a particular shot using an elevator that is amazingly awesome. It really tapped into what I love about action movies at points.The scope of the movie is as small as the budget, and although the story is pretty ""been-there-done-that"", if you're looking for some fun action that's not taking itself seriously, you really can't go wrong with Everly.My final score: B+",positive
Rage,"I regret wasting time watching this movie. The movie is absolutely disjointed and lacks any sense. Nicholas, did you really take up this movie? First, Tokarev is the name of some random Russian guy Who appears for less than 5 minutes All the killings were senseless From Nicholas's daughter To his crew members. And Nicholas at the end. I could have done better producing this movie with my niece. Don't waste your time with this movie. And poor me was there, waiting for the climax of the movie but it never came. Characters were killed off too easily in the movie. For the girl: the cops were not smart enough to check the house for Gun Residue or something. Annoying movie. You have made me post an equally annoying review.",negative
Rage,"This movie is fantastic - honestly, it's shooting up my 'So Bad It's Good' charts with a bullet (badoom-tish!) I have no idea why Danny Glover's character is in it. Feels like he phoned someone and said, 'I need fifty bucks and I'm free on Sunday. Anything going down?' Peter Stormare, whilst generally good fun in crap flicks, is so utterly miscast it's borderline genius. What's that accent Pete? I can't tell if you mean to sound like a Canadian with palsy, or you were battling some gastro/intestinal thing, but damn bro, you sound pretty crook. Cage with his helmet or hair or whatever that thing is on his head is brilliant. Injecting heartfelt emotion into scenes that don't need it, screaming in new and obscure ways, playing it cool after trashing 20 corpses and fifty cars, he just injects a well-needed shake-up on traditional acting. Let's be completely inappropriate and flip between ham and wood - hello Oscar! Script has the bones of something in it, but the director has taken a leaf out of Cage's book here - let's not polish the turd, but rough it up some. Camera-work is just dire, dialogue makes the idea of a four-hour cunnilingus session on an angle grinder sound appealing, and seeing as Glover already took fifty from the budget, it left only another fifty for the rest of the film. And let's not forget such a momentous closing scene. Never have I cheered so hard for Cage. Top work fella, and the right choice. I can't honestly ask anyone to sit through this utter tosh, but I do know I'll watch it again in the future, with a bottle of vodka in the wee hours, and laugh my ass off.",positive
The Assassin,"I consider myself a person who usually does not have a hard time understanding what is going on in movies - even the ones that require some thought from the viewer :) But during this movie, I almost never knew what was going on. It sounds absurd when I say it - but in many of the later scenes of the movie, I really did not know who the characters were or what they were trying to accomplish. The pace of the movie is extremely slow, that could have been acceptable if it was made in a good way - which unfortunately is not the case.The action sequences are well done and I cant fault the acting, but that does not save this terrible movie.",negative
The Assassin,"I'm surprised by the bad reviews on IMDb. I think the problem is that a film titled ""The Assassin"" happens to attract a certain type of audience--people who are only interested in martial arts flicks, or who walk in expecting an action-packed adrenaline ride. You might be disappointed in this film, but I don't think this movie was meant for you.A previous review mentioned the ""depressed, stilted tones"" of the actors.I don't know what you were expecting ... an assassin during the Tang Dynasty to burst out into song about her inner anguish and emotional turmoil? I watched an interview with Hou Hsiao-hsien, the director who won the prestigious Best Director award at Cannes for this very film. He used a tennis analogy to explain it perfectly, so I'm just going to paraphrase below:""If you watch the tennis greats like Federer or Nadal battling it out, there's not much expression on their faces. The speed that they're going at, the power in each exchange, there's no room for emotions.""The director, Hou, actually instructed Shu Qi (The Assassin) to tone down her expressions. The crew filmed the fight sequences again, and again, and again, until the actors were all bruised up and the fight flowed naturally, by instinct. By this point, there was really no need for dialogue or excessive expressions. If you're an assassin fighting for your life, kill or be killed, are you really going to be thinking ""let me get my blue steel pout ready for the camera""?If you can get over the need for overly dramatic expositions and go into a film knowing the main character only has approximately nine spoken lines, and if you can enjoy a film for how starkly beautiful it is.... this might be the film for you.",positive
Risen,"I am a Christian, and I have the story of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection pretty well in my mind and heart. I must say that the story is almost as accurate as it is written from the bible, and the actors did a fantastic job portraying the lives of the disciples back then.I think the way Jesus is portrayed could have been better, with features that are less prominent, but I think it's down to individual and the director's opinion on this.Having said that, the movie convicted me and gave me really nice-and-fresh perspectives of the lives of the people and how Jesus and the crucifixion is viewed by the non-believers of that time.Personally, i think Christians should watch it to gain more insights and have a great 1.5hr of edutainment on the interactions and lives of the people in those days.The film is engaging, and I was certainly glued to the screen!",negative
Risen,"Risen is a well done action movie with strong writing of an old story in a fresh new way. Please don't waste your time picking apart the theology. All direct quotes from the Bible were accurate and powerfully depicted. It is a FICTIONAL account through the eyes of Pontius Pilate's right hand man (Roman tribune) Clavis. No, Jesus and the disciples did not hang out with a Roman after the resurrection. We all know that. It deviates from the Biblical story to show a different point of view and they do it graphically and with a great connection to the audience. This movie pretty much picks up where ""Passion of the Christ"" left off. They unabashedly told the story from the end of the crucifixion into the full-on resurrection, into the ascension and traveled with Christ into Galilee with the disciples all the way to the ascension. Somehow it was not hokey or silly. They did it well. I highly recommend you go see it while it is still in theaters. The scenery was beautiful.",positive
7 Days in Entebbe,"Interesting story - told from different perspectives.Sadly the movie is completely ruined by an utterly pointless dance sequence that is inserted at random moments in the movie.At the climax of the film, when the rescue operation is underway, the tension and flow is completely ruined by the fact that at least half the time, scenes from the pointless dance sequence are shown. Even if there is some artsy explanation for including this, it does not serve the story; in fact it halts the narrative entirely.They end up going all in with this nonsense, Terrence Malick-style, at the end credits: another dance sequence, this one even more bizarre and unnecessary. Had they left out this ridiculous, pretentious, utter baffling garbage it would have been a half decent, albeit very boring film.",negative
7 Days in Entebbe,"Great film that holds up pretty well in its attempt to stay neutral and explain personal motivations for both sides rather than putting labels, which is great considering the situation on the Middle East. 
Great acting.
Purposely chosen slow pace helps in character development.

The Last: Naruto the Movie,"horrible movie. road to ninja was popular because it gave time to all characters, and we got a sense of team 7 again (somewhat). the manga was originally about team 7, this movie just took that away. i like naruto and hinata together, really but they should have given the other couples some screen time too instead of leaving them hanging. i mean, even ten minutes each ? sasuke and sakura at least deserved some screen time, they're the main characters aside naruto, and the fans die to see team 7 moments again in combat since we haven't had those animated since narutos first season. ALSO they really should have given us some team 7 moments since this was the last movie we would get to see those. everyone loved the last moments of team 7 in the manga, that's what people like. TEAM 7. not naruto and hinata love throughout. they could have taken it side by side... naruto, hinata, sasuke and sakura in combat. that would have been epic, and would have addressed all the fans out there. Be is team 7, sasusaku and naruhina. that would have been an epic movie.",negative
The Last: Naruto the Movie,"Beautiful is the only word that can come to mind when thinking of this film. It was a master piece, and it was written by Kishimoto himself. This film also stood out among the many other non-canon films that have been produced, adding a bit more than your usual jam packed action. Believe it or not, but this is a story of Love, presenting the birth of the bond between Naruto Uzumaki and Hinata Hyuga. It shows how they have grown, changed and matured, stirring at the heart strings of the many Naruto fans that have watched it from start to finish. Words alone could not describe this films beauty, so I will say no more. What I will say is, I STRONGLY recommend that all of you fans of Naruto and Naruto Shippuden watch this. It is a film you should not miss.",positive
Welcome to the Punch,"Really bad...really bad! I give it 3 because of Mark Strong. But, this should not be the reason for rating a film - a great actor!

Welcome to the Punch,"Inspired by Hong Kong 'heroic bloodshed' flicks, this hardnosed cops 'n' robbers tale certainly lives up to its name. James McAvoy's supercop exhibits a dogged intensity in his hunt for Mark Strong's antiheroic supercrim. During their heated cat-and-mouse game, the two uncover a conspiracy much bigger than their own dispute.The two leads keep things moving along nicely with their ambiguous dynamic, with a supporting cast of familiar faces picking up back-end duties rather nicely. Special mention must go to Shane Meadows favourite Johnny Harris who, as a cold-blooded ex-military henchman, exudes a barely-restrained predatory animalism, familiar to those who saw him in This is England '86. Top performances, decent pacing, and an ending which refuses to settle it all in quite the neat and tidy way one would expect.",positive
Max Steel,"One of the worst super hero movie of 2016. Extremely slow to tell a story, no action (except for the last few mins of the movie), too many annoying flash back. Seem like the director wasn't sure if he wants to make a sci-fi movie, chic flix, or comedy.. it turns out to be a big mess that drag on and on. People walking out in the middle of the movie, if it wasn't for my 11 year old, I would have done the same.. After the movie, my 11 year old even comment how bad the movie was! Here's an example of how slow the movie was.. the first min. of the movie, it also indicate Max has super power, it took about 30 mins of the movie to finally confirm his super power. Then another 40 mins of the movie to talk about nothing much with flash back.. and finally 5 mins of action (fight scene) to beat the bad guy. When you think it's all over.. they spend another 15 mins to put some unnecessary romance and filler to make the movie 92mins long, so that you don't think the movie is being too short.",negative
Max Steel,"Well lets take it one step at a time. 1) the movie starts well with a mystery going on around our main character and a good enough introduction of the rest of the characters. 2) the plot is good but it doesn't fit only to one movie so i hope for another one. 3) the end, well i am not gonna spoil this but the movie prepares the audience for the end (that makes the movie predictable -ish) but who doesn't like to say ""i knew it"". I liked max and defensively loved steel, i hope there was more about the background of steel and max but i put my faith on the next movie if there is going to be any. It's a movie decent enough to go on a sequel. So i am giving it a 10 because for the kind of movie it is it's very good.",positive
Next Gen,"First off. The good. Robots are pretty awesome. Some silly robots like the noodle bots and the toothbrush bot but generally they are cool. Especially the main robot. They are well incorporated into a futuristic background that doesn't seem too far off. However. The major let down is the highly unlikeable lead. She is a terrible character with nothing but rottenness in her personality. She is a bully, and unkind. And she justifies that because ""oh her father left when she was younger"". So it is just acceptable that she acts up, hurts others, blames all her misfortunes on everyone else, play guilt mind games. She never learns from her mistakes instead takes it out on everyone else around her. She is not even a little self aware nor does she accepts any responsibility for her own actions. She does not have any redeemable quality. As you watch the movie, instead of making you feel sympathetic to her and engage in her adventure, I find that I am filled with so much hate for her that I actually want to see her fail. I want her to be punished, and that does not make a good story if it makes the viewers hate the lead and want to see her fail! I find myself rooting for the villian and that almost never happens!If the story was just about the robot it would have been 10 stars.",negative
Next Gen,"Aside from the film involving robots with feelings this is far from Big Hero 6. I love BH6 and this film is definitely up there with it. Some reviews below were rated poorly based on the main character Mai being an angry brat but that IS her character and if she made you feel that way then her job was complete. Her actions were intended to upset you and make you disagree with them so great job with that! Those that said the film is too violent are just being overly sensitive. Look at all the kids films/shows out there that are just as violent, if not more - Power Rangers, DragonBallZ,Tom & Jerry, TMNT, The Lion King, etc - Stop being so sensitive people. I thought Momo the dog was the highlight of the show. The beeping was hilarious and we don't really know what is being said, we're just assuming it was cussing but it really added a lot of humor to the film.I really liked how the film depicted humans as being so dependent and addicted to the robots, much like how we are so addicted to our phones and other technology now. The animation was amazing, kudos to Tangent studios for a great job! Overall the film is fantastic for both kids and adults.",positive
Monsters: Dark Continent,"What a load of pretentious, art w*nk nonsense this film really is.It's bad enough that the story is paper thin and the characters are as unlikeable as an upset stomach (one minute gangsta tough, the next screaming like babies) but the direction is shocking.It's like a frustrated art student trying out every possible style of image capture. Long shots, close shots, lens flare, angled, shaky cam, slow mo and none of them working.One pointless scene of a helicopter taking off showed it's ascent from at least 10 different angles - outside looking up, inside looking out, inside looking inside, outside different angle etc etc.Every character must have had at least two shots of them silent screaming from the Dummies Guide to filming internal angst.Things aren't explained, geography is not established and you can almost feel the makers telegraphing their contempt to the audience that 'if you don't get this, you're too stupid'.It's not engaging, thought provoking or entertaining. And when it's finished all you can contemplate is the utter pointlessness of the whole film.I know many complain of studio execs interfering with a film but you really have to question who greenlit this laughable project or signed off the finished product for general release.Whoever it was can't tell the difference between a movie and a flickerbook of cool filtered Instagram pics.",negative
Monsters: Dark Continent,"Just saw the Empire Magazine Premiere of this film at the aptly named Empire Leicester Square. As with a with other London Film Festival offerings a brief introduction normally with a few words from the director, and the odd actor or screenwriter was done. The introduction was kicked off by scruffiest person I have seen all year from Empire Magazine (to be fair to him he did admit as much) Then there was a vote of thanks by the director Tom Green who then proceeded to, I exaggerate not, thank EVERY person involved in the movie (I wondered what the end credits were for) this went on forever it seemed. All the films stars were paraded on the stage all suited and booted and all MALE. That aside I settled down to watch the film. First let's go back to the Empire Magazine guy who ""warns"" that this film was a war move. Back to the film It starts off with our ""heroes"" involved in a conflict with insurgents in the Middle East and spends the ENTIRE film as a war movie with the Monsters in the background. We were warned remember? Now I thought war movie in the context of he title Monsters meant Alien vs. Humans not war movie as in Hurt Locker. So you can gather by now that I did not like the movie, the acting was so clichéd it hurt, the script and dialogue was all over the place and it tried to be too many things at the same: War movie, Sci-Fi, War Movie, Drama, War Movie, Action, War Movie, Road Movie, War Movie (did I say war movie?). I do not go into this film expecting to watch, wait for it a WAR MOVIE. I have seen else where on this site that this film is better than the first one. IT IS NOT, the original was not exactly a flawless piece or work, but its main appeal was that it was made on a shoestring budget with a director's vision, wit and a wing and a prayer. This film was empty and for all the bullets flying around was frankly quite boring. It only lit up when the Monsters of the title Remember? Appeared. To be brutality honest THE MONSTERS were this film's BEST ACTORS. To be fair to this film, and I'm really trying to be, the monster effects were excellent. But the monsters had very little airtime, it looked like the creatures had other engagements and had no time to remains in this particular movie!",positive
Raazi,Misinterpretation of history about Bangladesh vs Pakistan in 1971.,negative
Raazi,"Raazi does what very few Bollywood movies do right. It pulls off a tight script with good acting, and a realistic believable storyline that leaves you on the edge of your seat for two hours. The film also manages to maintain a tight pace while building up towards an impactful climax. In particular, I think three things made it unforgettable: Firstly, the acting was on point, and made the movie what it turned out to be. Alia Bhatt is turning out to be an absolute genius, and has come a long way from her 'student of the year' days. There are very few in her peer-group that can do justice to these kinds of roles. Vicky Kaushal was good as the beguiled husband, and his restrained yet emotional male character (supporting a powerful female lead) is a Bollywood rarity, and was thoroughly enjoyable. The others are on point too, with minor actors like Jaideep Ahlawat and Rajit Kapoor delivering strong performances. Secondly, the movie turned out to be tight and on point, with no melodramatic displays of emotion or sappy songs. The good old premises of a bride departing to her husband's household for (presumably) good, the arranged marriage with a virtually unknown man, and eventual marriage consummation were all present, in theory. These are all typically perfect opportunities to inject unnecessary bridal parting songs, lengthy wedding song and dance sequences (boy's side, girl's side, etc.) and the worst of all - a song balancing sleaze with ""Indian culture"" (read: censor board mandated restraint) that plays when the marriage is consummated (this is typically a couple kissing and rolling around in a bed, carefully clothing their privates with velvet or satin sheets). But Raazi eliminates all of this fluff and more, leaving you wishing more movies would do away with the crap in favor of keeping the pace of the plot. Lastly, and most importantly, Raazi does justice to the complexity of the India-Pakistan conflict. The countries have a shared history which makes the war painfully more unique (e.g. Abdul, the oldest and most faithful caretaker in the Pakistani household is of Indian origin). The movie takes no sides, and shows you that humanity and ruthlessness exist on both sides. This is a significant departure from the patriotic films of yesteryear - we are habituated to seeing a good vs evil theme, and having Pakistanis depicted as soulless warmongers. And so, you are simply not prepared to empathize with Iqbal's (Vicky Kaushal's) gentle persona, and when you do, it his vulnerable humanity hits you like a truck. Conversely, the hardened Indian intelligence agent Mir is many things during the movie, but 'human' he is not. I walked away from the theater understanding better the nature of such wars, and that the real conflict is not over Kashmir, or between two sides, or between ideologies. The real conflict is always fought within the human heart: between the ruthless imperatives of duty, and the very human urges of gentleness, mercy and love.",positive
Man of Tai Chi,"Keanu keanu keanu ... silly silly movie .. tried hard to like it .. but it's just really a painful to watch & terribly awful directing debut! Fight scenes are nothing spectacular.. storyline was very predictable and acting-wise? don't even go there! :o)) .. should stick in front of the camera, not behind, just for the sake of helping old friend (Tiger Chen) ...hope they'll reboot the next Matrix! the end credits scenery & soundtrack is really soothing though ... 1 star of 10 (that's being a generous Matrix big fan) (spoiler) and that 'screaming' on the camera thing ... please!! ... not sure what was he thinking when he decided to include that! very cringe-worthy seconds!",negative
Man of Tai Chi,"I saw this film and was blown away by it as a total package. As a first time director, Keanu was very sure of himself, stylistically. he didn't try to bite off too much story wise, allowing him to keep a very tight narrative; no wasted drama or superfluous frames. many more experienced directors, that everyone considers ""great"" can't do that. most movies ramble and unconsciously divert and subvert their story lines, and ultimately what they want to say. i think this movie can stand several viewings because it operates on many levels, between drama and action, overlaid with a layer Taoism/Buddhism, which i think he found necessary to use as a reference to measure the state of modern reality. another way to look at this is that the whole film is a metaphor for the struggles in modern china: the old vs the new, and when they clash, the conditions that are created have to be dealt with or there can can be enormous consequences. i can tell that he put a lot of thought into the content and the style that complements it. i don't know the relationship that he has with his cinematographer, Elliot Davis, but it must be a very complementary and conscious one. they turned out, not only a meaningful film in a genre that most people write off as pure entertainment but a total package. make no mistake about it, the fight sequences are astonishing, too, some of which i think are unique in Kung Fu annals. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT",positive
A-X-L,"Okay I did enjoy A-X-L romping around the desert with miles on his dirt bike, flying through the air as they bonded. A kid and his billion dollar super dog.With that out of the way, at about 40 minutes into the movie I realized two things. This militarized billion dollar dog weapon, soooo scary looking with super growling 'teeth' was as dangerous as a kitten. Second was the scene where super dog faces off with the evil 18 year old. Does it matter what weapon the 18 year old has? After all he's facing a billion dollar 'weapon of war', right? Suffice to say A-X-L is no match for a teenager. Later, when he targets an evil teen he is unable to stop the teen from running away and diving under a car. At no time does this screenplay have A-X-L take down even a single evil peson whether evil teen or evil military contractor who created him. Sure, he can run and bark like heck... but no where do we see a billion dollar weapon in action.Also, one could ask why A-X-L escapes from his creators in the first place?
Not a clue. After all, he was created to save the lives of our soldiers at war. Kind of a noble invention, yet as the movie begins he's gon AWOL. Why would he not wish to return to his creator and his mission to save our soldiers lives. That is in fact his prime directive, to bond with a single solder at war. It's not like he's a nuclear bomb we could debate. Again, screwy screenplay where evil creator is not really evil. One could say that A-X-L going AWOL was super dog being very, very bad dog!The notion one could build or rebuild an A-X-L in a garage with a soldering iron also left me scratching my head.Fun idea with an awful, nonsensical screenplay.",negative

Monster Trucks,"I'm actually quite surprised Chris Wedge, the director who gave us the first Ice Age and Robots giving us his first live action family feature. Now it might have looked good on paper and could have possibly been better as an animated feature but this movie is a monster shame. X-Men's Havoc, Lucas Till takes the lead role as disgruntled, unhappy teenage Tripp who works at the local scrapyard which also serves his hobby of building his own truck. Jane Levy impressed me earlier this year with Don't Breathe and it's hard to believe that they're both the same actress, here being the sweet yet geeky town girl who has a keen interest in Tripp. It's a silly plot for a silly film but is too far fetched and weak with too many plot holes in surprised the film stayed together. Strange and undiscovered, intelligent creatures accidentally get released from their underground habitat. Feasting on oil and having an unlikely ability to power vehicles, basically a slimy horse with a metal shell. There's a few surprises of a supporting cast with me thinking ""oh look, it's so and so"" but none help prop up the all-round poor performance. I actually wonder what convinced them to star in this film. It must have been tricky to come up with a monster that's grotesque yet cute and friendly at the same in the end resembling a Jabba the Hutt with the characteristics of Toothless and E.T. Actually the films has some elements of both previously mentioned but more Iron Giant and Mac And Me. The special effects were good, not perfect but served the film well enough. The stunt driving was impressive and offers the most fun in the story as the film lacked any real comedy value. The soundtrack is okay but nothing memorable from David Sardy.It's possible this film was doomed from the beginning having problems with post-production that kept pushing the release dates back to well over a year. Even Nickelodeon had pulled out at one stage. It's unfortunately a step backwards for Wedge and for everyone involved. This might be a film they could possibly want to forget about but, it actually serves a purpose and the much younger audiences actually seemed to enjoy it. But I'm sorry Wedge, if the future of your live action films end up like this, I suggest sticking to the drawing board. It's brainless and more for the younger geeks among us. Running Time: 4 The Cast: 6 Performance: 4 Direction: 3 Story: 3 Script: 3 Creativity: 4 Soundtrack: 4 Job Description: 2 The Extra Bonus Points: -5 for being a terrible idea even for a kid's film. 28% 3/10",negative
Monster Trucks,"I took my youngest child, six years old (nearly seven), to see this yesterday.

This coming from a boy who loves everything from Harry Potter, Star Wars, Top Gear (and Grand Tour), to Tractor Ted and Octonauts.As an adult, it was a perfectly acceptable way to spend a couple of hours enjoying the company of my child. There's not a lot to the story, so if you've seen the trailer you won't be surprised. The monsters straddle the line well between being ""monstrous"" and cute (my boy acted suitably scared until it became clear that the monsters were on the good side, after which he loved them).He came out of the cinema asking when it would be available on DVD, so on balance a glowing recommendation from a 6 year old and a warm fuzzy one from me.",positive

Howl,"A story on stranded train passengers in the middle of the forest at the wee end of the night against unknown blood thirsty creatures makes for a good horror story on paper but when it comes to translating it into a creature feature, screenwriter/director has failed big time. A very predictable cliché-ridden screenplay with utterly boring action sequences in which none of the characters on the screen garners viewer's interest/sympathy, making it a very dull affair. The film is filled with such ridiculously unbelievable stupid characters/moronic moments from starting frame to the end frame that it's not even comes closer to those films which are so bad that it's good category. This film needs its own category in terms of how awful a creature feature can go.There are hardly any redeeming qualities that I could find in this unadulterated pathetic excuse for a film of epic proportion.",negative

This creature feature totally does what it says on the tin - scary as hell monsters, believable characters from different background fighting to live through the night - plenty of gore but loads of fun too. A real stand out bad guy performance from Elliot Cowan as a psycho banker determined to survive. Great comic relief too from Amit Shah as a nerdy accountant who turns out to be surprisingly handy in a fight! Great cameos from Sean Pertwee, Rosie Day and Duncan Preston. Recommended.",positive

He now merely exists and his greatest wish still is to die. It is during his existence he realizes he is nowhere near getting his wish.I loved the style of this movie. The beginning scene is shot in black and white, so don't think there's anything wrong with your television or the movie. The way the black and white part of the film segues into the color portion is amazing. I loved all the characters introduced, as they all had depth to them--everyone had his/her own back story.This film is rated ""R"" for constant graphic violence, a little salty language, and adult themes. I hope that I can find more films done by this director because this one certainly was entertaining. In Japanese with subtitles and has a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes.",negative
Blade of the Immortal,"Fairly decent movie.
There are some inconsistencies between this and the anime but that didn't bother me that much.
And the anime is not that great to begin with.
It's an enjoyable watch in the end.What I didn't like:
Manji's relationship with Rin is very basic. They almost never interact after the introduction scene.
Rin screams. A lot.",positive
Jue di tao wang,"I know the modern millennials, the intellectually inept, and also the emotionally unstable will not get it, but this little gem is a return to a time when movies meant to entertain rather than degrade.Yes the acting is simple and fun, but this isn't a history piece. Yes the story line is quick and nostalgically pure, but it isn't a melodrama. But here's what this film is not: it is not full of disgusting pornography and unnecessarily perverted innuendos to keep today's ""youth"" entertained by pulling on their neanderthal limbic responses to get a bite. There is no blood or gore as we see it today that can ruin even an adult psyche by today's idea of cinematic ""morals"". It does not inject politically correct ethical impurities to persuade those of lesser IQ and mental instinct to clap at every pop culture reference toward popular political brainwashing dogmas. It does not pretend to be anything but what it is, a wholesome and entertaining flick. It is what movies used to be like and what I respect Jackie Chan for continuing to do even today, and that is make movies that a normal set of parents can go see with their adolescent kids and not worry of at any second two men that look like women will try to force some insanity of pseudo logic and propaganda on my family. This movie reminds me of what movies were like when actors didn't get paid $30 million apiece (even if these actors did - who knows) just to show up and ""act"". This movie reminds me of when going to the movies meant joy and entertainment, even if it wasn't necessarily deep. perfect for families and it made me smile, because it brought back a touch of hope that maybe, just maybe, movies may one day return to a time when no agenda needed to be pushed and simple entertainment for a family audience was the only desired effect.This is not Citizen Kane or Casablanca, but I still give it highest marks for doing that which in today's chaotic time of violence, filth, greed and social degradation may be considered ""boring"" by people who have passed the event horizon of stupidity. That alone earns it a ten in my book.There's hope.",negative
Jue di tao wang,"Look, I am a huge Jackie Chan fan and I have seen quite a few of his films that were accessible to American audiences. He has done some remarkable movies in his day. Anyone the hasn't seen Police Story 1 or 2 is missing some of the most hardcore action ever put to film. Legend of the Drunken Master is a classic film. Project A, Armour of the Gods, Rumble in the Bronx, Rush Hour, and on and on and on. I love Jackie Chan.This film however is bad. I mean capital B A D. The action sequences are poorly filmed. The dialogue is terrible. The story progression is horrendous. The acting is atrocious. I wanted to like this movie...I really did. Jackie Chan has broken down so many barriers. His comedic style is something that has given me laughs upon laughs for years. But it just doesn't work this time.I chalk it up to a poor script, the fact that he is probably slowing down some in his older age, and just bad direction, bad writing, and horrible editing.Watch at your own risk.",positive
Wheelman,"This movie gets grating after a while. Basically the entirety of the movie takes place with the lead actor behind the wheel, dashing from place to place while visibly upset and making liberal use of foul language. After about 1/2 of that (if not sooner) it starts to get old and I just wanted it to be over.",negative
Wheelman,"This spare, stark, simple double-cross story is hung on the bones of some of the best road-action camera work I've seen since the 1980s. The chase- scene shot sequencing hearkens back to the early giants of the genre: Bullit, The Driver, The Blues Brothers. The makers spend plenty of attention on watching the Wheelman manipulate the controls of his car and presenting realistic, easy-to-follow driving choreography. Nothing in this thing breaks your suspension of disbelief... unlike other multi-million dollar, CGI-choked car-chase franchises I can think of. Yes, as some reviewers have complained, most of the conflict is advanced through cell phone conversations, but that merely serves to throw the many actions sequences into even sharper relief. The director never pulls you out of the car to set you safely on the sidelines as the action goes whizzing by; you're in the seat with the bullets flicking past your head. Sit down, listen to the dialogue, and you'll like this inexpensive little jewel.",positive
Collide,"While ex-pat Casey Stein (Nicholas Hoult) is in a night club, he meets a bartender, Juliet (Felicity Jones) and they are in love.

Casey gets involved in a crime which includes multiple chase scenes, car wreaks, and he must have gotten shot at 100 times or so...all misses. It was a one man ""fast and furious"" on the Autobahn.The film was fairly well constructed with only minor ""twists"" which was simply stuff we didn't see happen. It was primarily an action film first and love story second. The teaser crash scene in the beginning, comes at about an hour into the feature.Guide: No sex or nudity. I don't recall any F-words",negative
Collide,"It's one of those films with aimless narration. Indeed, it has a nice cast and characters with the basic storyline, but that did not expand and explored well as it should have been. At least the pace of the narration looked fine. Some characters looked unnecessary, and so a couple of scenes. If these all were managed, then still it could have been a decent film. Because since it is an action- adventure, they did not generate those crucial parts like the stunts and dialogues related to the gangster thing to turn it a better film in its kind.The two veteran actors coming together for the first time added more curiosity than flavour we are looking for. They did okay and so the rest of the cast. Ideal runtime, a few stuffs were in the favour of the film, but those were not enough for the overall success. If the same film was made from the non-English world like perhaps Germany, which was one of the producers of the film would have done better than this existing one which is very familiar with this language.People would watch it only for Hopkins and Kingley and so did am I. But they might end in disappointment, or that could be the reason to rate it fairly better. Whatever, this is an okay film, which is barely entertaining and of all, not a boring film. So trying it for one is okay, but I think not worth if you have got plenty of options over this one.6/10",positive

Uri: The Surgical Strike,"If I have to say in one word then it'd be MASTERPIECE. It can very well be a classic...a cult classic like Border. This movie doesn't portray blatant Jingoism but strikes the right chords of patriotism with maintaining the right balance. It is so well done that you'd crave for more even if it ends. Everyone performed very well and Vicky Kaushal was stunning. The movie is very inspiring and everyone especially the young generation should watch it to know what the army men do for them. The movie is not political at all but yellow media will try to demean it for 'certain' reasons.
I still can't get over the top notch screenplay, direction, background scores, visuals and performances. A straight 9.5/10 (or may be 10/10 if I don't be skeptical) from me.",positive
In Order of Disappearance,"""Kraftidioten"" is the newest project between director Hans Petter Moland, writer Kim Fupz Aakeson and actor Stellan Skarsgård. The three have worked together on quite a few projects in the past already. Here Skarsgård, back from being a priest to Lars von Trier, plays a dedicated hard worked who turns into a mass-murderer after his son is killed by drug dealers. After his wife leaves him, he has basically nothing to lose anymore. Let me say that this film has lots of graphic and bloody violence, so if you are easily-offended by that, better give it a pass.Apart from Skarsgård, there are two other performances here who deserve a mention. The first is Bruno Ganz (""Downfall"") as the Eastern European equivalent to Marlon Brando's godfather. A truly funny performance and I laughed a lot at his face expression when he is in the car near the end and everybody firing at everybody. It had a bit of ""Why all this violence?"" to it, but I guess it actually meant ""Why can't I join in with all of them having the fun?"" He did shortly afterward. The second performance comes from Pål Sverre Hagen. He plays the main villain in this movie and you may have seen him in the Oscar-nominated ""Kon-Tiki"" as Thor Heyerdahl. Anyway, back to this movie, his character reminded me a bit of Gary Oldman in ""Léon"". He's a very violent, very tragic and a complete sociopath. His interaction with his ex-wife pretty much show the humor in the whole movie. Very, very dark.I also would like to say a few words about the brother. His statement that the main character could never kill someone was funny given what happened before and his final scene in the car was really good. He knew he was going to die anyway, so he took all the blame and he pulled it off convincingly. He managed to protect his girlfriend/wife and also his brother, at least for a little while. Then there were also the main villain's henchmen, who were gay for whatever reason and had a secret relationship. (I expected one of them to kill the boss in the end, because he killed his partner earlier, but nope.) Another dark humor sequence for this film. Admittedly I did not find this one really funny, just absurd somehow, like many other parts of the film, but not in a bad way.The central character gets called Dirty Harry at some point, but I felt it is more of a Norwegian ""Taken"" with a touch of ""Kill Bill"". In any case, Ganz and Skarsgård had the final scene together. I guess it was to show how they bonded as they killed the man who was responsible for killing their offspring. I did not really like the ending though. It was not bad, but also not one of the highlights of the film, which the ending should usually be for a film to be considered great. And with that I don't mean it has to be a happy ending in any case (I prefer an unhappy ending to a rushed forced happy ending).If the likes of ""In China They Eat Dogs"" are your cup of tea, you have a nice almost two hours ahead of you here. It has many funny parts, even the insertions of who just got killed have something funny to them, especially after the fight where almost everybody dies near the end. Or a random scene where somebody gets killed in a car and we see him falling into the airbag which can't save your life if you're hit by a couple bullets, I found funny too. So yeah.. If you don't mind graphic violence, give this one a watch.",negative
In Order of Disappearance,"As the critics said some days ago, when Kraftidioten (International titled ""In order of disappearance"") premiered in the main program of the Berlin Film Festival, this is both hilarious, rough and beautiful. While giving loads of fun and entertainment, you'll soon discover that the film has a complex underlying theme which makes this interesting on a much wider scale.But still, this is not a film for the faint hearted. That said as a warning, because the body-count is bigger than in any Norwegian film I've seen before. There's no sex, but all violence in this, still testosterone filled, movie with a hero called ""Dickman"". You can't say it more obvious than that.Or what about a plot with a Swedish plowman working in the remote Norwegian high mountains dealing with Norwegian and Serbian gangsters in a vigilante film, crossed with beautiful Norwegian landscape and droll humor!?! Well, it's completely up my alley.Hans Petter Moland always delivers. He has made the great films ""A somewhat gentle man"", ""The last lieutenant"", ""Zero Kelvin"", ""Aberdeen"" and ""Comrade Pedersen"" amongst others. All of them recommended! It's ""A somewhat gentle man"" which is most like this last one.If you loved ""Fargo"", ""Burn after reading"", ""The big white"" or ""In Bruges"" this is the film for you. It's almost a mix, though it's a bit more dark and bloody, and has a more serious underlying theme. This is balanced beautifully with giving death announcements in a way I've never seen before after the body count rises. It's seems like a film that doesn't take itself too seriously, though it still has some hilarious Tarantino-like discussions, mainly from minor roles, which adds a lot to the film. They are discussing the great food in the Norwegian prison system, how Norwegians are so environmental that they pick up dog litter in little bags, and the Scandinavian welfare system is discussed as a need because of the snow and lack of sun. A country where even the gangsters drink tomato juice and drive hybrid electric Fisker Karma cars.But what makes ""In order of disappearance"" stand out as much more than a hilarious masculine violent ""Fargo"" is that it actually is a deeper comment about how men act. Our anti superhero is called Dickman, because he really acts like one, though still being a nice and likable man. Not able to express feelings to his wife, which leaves him, avenging that his bloodline via his lost son is all that matters. Of course we know that our society is patriarchal. In this film it's over-exaggerated, but giving a good comment on today's society. The men are the one's both criminal and the users of violence. Dickman didn't even know his son, and though being a ""nice"" kidnapper, he doesn't even know how to read a bed time story. The film has almost no affection, except between men, and film maker Moland knows to punish those kinds of forbidden feelings. He also, in more way than one, express that men are stupid, doing stupid things, which almost always has a severe consequence.This is the kind of film I wish would never end. I enjoyed it immensely right from the start, and it even grew from there. The film doesn't give all answers, but our vigilante hero at least gets to do some ""good"" deeds along the way. And if you hate drug dealers, then this is the film for you.Stellan Skarsgård is perfect as the understated Swedish immigrant, just voted the inhabitant of the year in his little mountain town, which is a place we really don't get to know where is. The signs says ""Welcome to Tyos..."" and then the snow constantly covers the rest of the name. Even Oslo is made as a Alaskan-like ice city, where mountains are put where they usually not are. Our hero takes the matters in his own hands when he understands that the police are considering not to investigate the case of his son found dead by drug overdose in the city. He knows of course this is murder. And he is going to revenge his son's death.The film has so many great supporting roles, which all make up this story, and I'm sure this film will do great world wide. Great scripting again from Danish Kim Fupz Aakeson and great filming by Philip Øgaard. The scenery is awesome, an adds to the film's sentimentality as well as beauty, which makes the whole environment even more exotic.It's the fourth time Stellan Skarsgård is featured in a Moland-film, and it's not difficult to understand why. But Bruno Ganz is perfect as the Serbian gangster Papa and I also loved Pål Sverre Hagen as the neurotic vegan gangster ""Greven"" (The Count). But so many from the supporting cast should be praised as well.Be sure to pick up this treat of a dark gangster comedy! As bloody as they come, but still with a great heart! You won't regret!",positive
Bajrangi Bhaijaan,"I went to see BB on the day of release with my wife and 17 year old son. I'm not Indian or Pakistani, but white British, so it was fun sat in a cinema full of Pakistanis, to watch a film that could have painted Pakistani in a negative light.Judging by the murmuring I could her there did seem to be some people during the interval that were not too impressed with the film - slow, boring, blah, blah - but by the end I think everyone left happy.From a white British guys perspective I thought it was a terrific film, and so did my wife and son. Great story, interesting characters, a ridiculously cute kid who stole the show without saying very much, excellent music, and some scenery that took your breath away.I thought Salman Kahn was great, much more three dimensional than I was expecting. Kareena Kapoor provided a massive dose of eye-candy and played her part well too, although it would have been nice for that part to have been developed more.But for me the star of the show - other than Harshaali Malthotra, the little girl - was definitely Nawazuddin Siddiqui. He is one of the most mesmerising actors I've ever seen. He could read the label of a sauce bottle and have everyone transfixed.In typical Bollywood style the first half was your typical setting-the-scene, which I thought was done very well, and it kept me interested throughout, but after the interval, as soon as Nawazuddin Siddiqui made his appearance, the film took off and didn't let-up until the end.All-in-all a thoroughly enjoyable film for all the family.",negative
Bajrangi Bhaijaan,"Despite being a Salman fan I was not too impressed with some of his recent flicks which in my humble opinion lacked freshness or had mindless direction, so when a family member bought tickets for this movie I didn't go in with high expectations. But to you dear reader I'll say GO WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS! It will not disappoint! And more importantly go with your heart - that is all you need for this 2.5 hours long film to become one of the best you've seen in years. It's just one of those movies with such heart-tugging moments and the highlight - the bond between Pawan (Salman) and Shahida (Harshali) - which is such a delight to see that you forget all about plot, logic, direction - not to say that the movie lacks that. The perfection in execution is definitely there, especially in the second-half. I watched it in the AVX theatre with at least 500 others and from the sound of it at least 75% of them regardless of age or gender were crying from the intermission onwards - sometimes because it was sad and other times because the screenplay was just so pure and unfiltered that it just made these happy tears bubble up inside of you.There is a certain level of comedy throughout and definitely some deep witty one-liners. My favourite was from Nawazuddin Sidduiqi (who played his role to perfection) who pointing at the current state of the media and their polarization of India and Pakistan proclaimed that ""Hatred sells. Mohabbat doesn't."" The movie has depth, a message, and the cuteness overload that is Harshali Malhotra. It also has a relationship and emotions so simple yet so extraordinary that they make a hero out of a common man. :)",positive
War on Everyone,"The trouble with John Michael McDonagh is that he's not half as clever as he thinks he is or that he would like us to think he is. If he was really smart he wouldn't be making pretentious crap like ""War on Everyone"". This should have been just another buddy cop movie with a lineage that goes all the way back to the seventies but that would have been too common-place for a man like McDonagh, the much less talented brother of playwright and filmmaker Martin McDonagh.""War on Everyone"" is a semi-serious, name-dropping, (from feminism, the classics, literature, the movies, popular music; the kind of things 'smart' people are supposed to know about), buddy movie, all done in the worst possible taste which isn't a problem in itself; I love bad taste when it's funny but this just isn't funny. On the plus side, the ridiculously handsome Alexander Skarsgard, (son of Stellan), who plays one half of our pair of anti-heroes, shows that given a half decent script he might even be able to deliver the goods. Otherwise, that's about it. Don't waste your time.",negative

Brick Mansions,"I like the good cinematography, even the opening credits alone already made me liked it. David Belle is still very cool with his spins, back-flips, jumps and other stunts. It has been 10 years but I don't see any degradation of his parkour skills.Paul Walker did good as Belle's partner-in-crime, even though he can't do parkour, he still kicked-ass. Catalina Dennis who plays Belle's girlfriend is consistent with her character, a tough girl who doesn't stand still with unfair treatments. The lousy one is RZA who plays the drug lord Tremain. Well, in my opinion he can't act, his face expression just doesn't make it.For those who like parkour but haven't watched Banlieue 13, this might as well be in your watchlist. It's still okay even if you have watched Banlieue 13 (like me), because it was in French and it felt quite weird, even with subtitles.",negative
Brick Mansions,"Well, this belongs to the realm of completely unnecessary remakes, since the source material also was found wanting to begin with. With that out of the way, a description can be made of the changes for this remake of 'Banlieu 13' or 'District 13':Cyril Rafaelli, who was cast in the unnecessary sequel as well, is missed here, since he was an able Parkour counterpart to Belle in the original. Walker's visible lack of martial-arts talent is made more conspicuous because of this. The'sister' is now the 'ex-girlfriend'. - There is now a lady lesbian villianness. The 'dad' angle. The not-too-evil baddies. Badly choreographed Parkour and non-Parkour action sequences. Really sad, since this was the movie's apparent USP. An older, unenthusiastic David Belle.The only person who seemed to be giving it all here is RZA, who chomps into his suave-looking bad guy role with gusto that could have been served better by its writers/makers. He did the same job in 'Protector 2', which was probably worse. Hope he gets better material in his next go-around.The CGI's bad, the writing's bad, the production design's possibly some of the worst you can get, and this ideally should've been ignored on cable as well.Feel sad for David Belle, and worse for 'Parkour'.

Unfortunately, they didn't have the funds or imagination. The result compares unfavorably with the average movie made for the syfi channel.Thomas Jayne was obviously embarrassed to be in this since he obscured his looks in shambling meth addict wardrobe and makeup.

It is sorta like a ""starter hill"" in skiing, just a nice gentle downhill slope to start your review on, and then your own momentum will take you safely to the bottom, err, end.These are my notes, to get you going * I can claim to have seen Westworld when released in a real theatre. However in a world where today's viewers have the attention span of a bumblebee, that was a long long time ago. Hollywood can remake or re-imagine it if they like. In point of fact, the core idea (seen only in the first 20 minutes, before the film seems to run out of creativity) of redoing it from the POV of the robots (oops, ""artificials"") is bloody clever and deserved much more traction than it got.* did you know Bruce Willis is 60 years old? He has been the backbone of the industry for decades (seems like just yesterday he jumped from MOONLIGHTING to DIE HARD) but he is not getting the plum roles anymore. The real bitter and ugly irony here is that Jane is doing the Willis role and not very well. If you are an alert reviewer, in every scene where Jane and Willis face off (not many) you ache to hit the pause button and imagine what the film would be like if they reversed roles.* Childers is gorgeous. But you knew that. One of the requirements to get the role is that you had to be gorgeous.

Headshot,"I'm still waiting to watch my first good Indonesian movie because Headshot isn't the one. I read somewhere that it is a good movie for people who like a lot of action. Well I do like a lot of action every now and then but certainly not this kind of action. It's all so fake it becomes an embarrassment. There is a lot of action, no doubt about that, but the action scenes are most of the time painful to watch. Our local hero, who everybody wants dead, can easily fight twenty though guys. Nothing wrong with that if he's that good and/or strong. But the problem that I have is why those twenty guys are just waiting their turn to try to kill him. Just attack him with twenty at once and job's done. The entire movie it is like that. And our local hero of course gets injured a lot but by miracle every next fight he has he's completely cured. From limping one second before, to beast mode in the next combat. And when there is machine gun shooting with a target at about two meters from you it's impossible to miss, just saying... The actors are also not that great. Everybody speaks Indonesian, what is absolutely logic since it is over there, except one that talks in English. Why he speaks in English is a mystery to everybody. There are loads of things that just don't make sense in this movie and that's why it's just not good. The filming is professional, that's for sure, the story is also okay, but the execution is just lame.",negative
Headshot,"I really wanted to see this on big screen but saw this on a 50 rs pirated copy. Had seen all of Iko Uwais' films. Had enjoyed The Raid in theatre. The plot line for Headshot may sound familiar, a man found on a shore, wounded and unconscious, wakes up in a rural hospital unable to remember anything. His attending lady physician gives him a new name. Later we come to know that the amnesiac man can do hand to hand combat n other self defense tactics efficiently. Viewers may compare this to Jason bourne, Kill bill or Faster but believe me this movie ain't no another revenge or secret agent run of the mill. This movie is an awesome adrenaline filled, high octane, brutal n bloody action film. Directed by Timo Tjahjanto and Kimo Stamboel (Macabre, Killers). They know how to position their camera best to capture Uwais in full on furious action mode. There is some good camera work n with the attractive locations, the film does engage visually too. The editing is frenetic. The action is non stop. But it is Uwais who is the star of this film. Uwais delivers the bone-breaking, gravity defying flurry of kicks, punches, eye gouges, and throat throttling. His action choreography is the best. This movie also has some of the best movie martial artists and stunt performers in the world — Iko Uwais, Julie Estelle, Very Tri Yulisman, Sunny pang, Zack Lee n David Hendrawan. Anything n everything can be a weapon when controlled by true masters : chopsticks, desks, broken plates, bus seats, pistols, shot guns, machete, rods, etc. but fists, elbows n feet are much deadlier weapons when controlled by them. Jason bourne, Kill bill n Faster looks like kindergarten in front of Headshot.",positive
Flu,"I'm generally a fan of Korean movies but this one is terrible. The exposition is a parade of clichés. The quirky buddies meet the feisty but sexy lady (who has a cute daughter). Then everyone in Bundang, a satellite city of Seoul, gets the flu and starts dying. Of course this is a rip-off of every Quarantine/Contagion movie you've ever seen but it's got none of the character/plot or budget to pull it off. The director is from the A.D.D. school of direction and although Jang Hyuk does good work as the fireman it's wasted. None of the actors embarrass themselves here to be fair. But there's no time for character development which is problematic as the movie has no plot instead relying on personal drama to carry the day. Sure an advanced ability to suspend disbelief is often a necessity in Korean movies but the idea that a virus could be contained in Bundang is just plain silly. About the only thing that amused me in this movie was the undercurrent of xenophobia. Of course Vietnamese workers are the source of the deadly virus (the Vietnamese provide a growing emigrant workforce as well as mail order brides in Korea) and the scene where the ""good"" Korean President threatens to shoot down the ""bad"" American jet bombers (ordered to bomb a mob threatening to break the quarantine cordon)doesn't say much for a generation that prefer to ignore how the Korean War was won. In a country where few will have seen Contagion and xenophobia is considered a virtue it's hardly surprising this movie has found popularity but for a foreign audience this movie is best avoided.",negative

Breaking In,"The movie about someone saving their family members has been done to death? So has every other subject.

Shaun's (Gabrielle Union) main goal is getting her kids out of the house. She tries to reason with them. Tells them they can have the money: she doesn't care. Just so long as they let Glover and Jaz out of the house. Violence is used only as a last resort.I find the best movies are the ones where you can connect/empathize with even the bad guys, as you can with Sam's character in this movie. He's a thief, a criminal, but he's not a murderer. He at least had some intention of doing the right thing in the movie.Ajiona Alexus is a great actress. She nails the role of a teenage girl.

He is led by three grim reapers who guide him through the seven trials in the Afterlife.The story initially is predictable, as he breezes though the initial trials. Then the film gets increasingly engaging and captivating. The final trials are not predictable anymore, and there is much suspense. The visuals are great, and there is clearly a lot of thought going into the visuals. The ending is very touching, particularly when viewers understand the Oriental culture about filial duties. Lots of tissues were used in the cinema!",positive
Big Game,"""Not political, not religious. He is just a certified grade-A psychopath."" I thought ""Why the hell not ?"" after seeing the poster of ""Big Game"". An adventure film, clearly aimed at a younger audience, with Air Force One crashing down somewhere in a Finnish forest and with the US president trying to saving himself with the help of a Finnish boy who just happens to undergo a local ritual so he can prove himself to the male population. And after I saw that Samuel L. Jackson also took part in this movie as the missing president, I didn't hesitate for a second. It's true that Jackson played some minor roles before this (""Oldboy"", ""Reasonable Doubt"" and ""Robocop""), yet I was pleasantly surprised by his last performance in ""Kingsman: The secret service"". So I went on the assumption that this was going to be a likable youth film, full of unabashed and not too far-fetched action.Boy oh boy. I didn't expect this to be such a crappy movie full of improbabilities, ridiculous situations and coincidences. Admittedly, it's indeed aiming for a younger audience, filled with teenage boys, who can have nice dreams that same night after watching such a film and imagine themselves acting as such a hero. But I'm convinced that most of them will shake their heads out of disapproval, while wondering if the makers of this film actually were convinced that they are really so naive.First lets start with the positive aspects. The scenery is matchless and breathtaking beautiful. I had no idea that Finland looked like that and I was tempted immediately to choose this country as a destination for my next holiday. Onni Tommila, a youthful Finnish actor, performed properly and does his job as the Finnish guide Oskari remarkably well. The entire film is clearly a homage to earlier films with youthful heroism as a central theme. It's a kind of film like ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" in which Short Round plays a prominent role or a typical Spielberg film like ""Empire of the Sun"". It brings back the nostalgia of fathers going to the cinema with their son to enjoy a cool film for guys. A prerequisite for such films is that the youthful contribution should smoothly transcend the ingenuity of the adults. In other words, the adults are presented as utter fools.What bothered me the most about this movie, were the totally absurd situations that arose. I admit, when you look at it from the perspective of a young person and you don't take it too serious, it comes across as an entertaining movie. A sort of ""Home Alone"" in a forest, where you're always a bit smarter and faster than the bad guys. But there are limits. Firstly I would like to purchase the brand of freezer they used here, because I think this high-tech-wonder-equipment is indestructible. Swinging under a helicopter, mowing through the woods, tumbling from a mountain, splashing into a lake and afterwards popping up out of the water like a purebred Russian submarine. And this ""undamaged"" ! Now that's what I call solid quality. But beware ! Make sure you don't end up inside this miracle appliance, because apparently it can't be opened from the inside. The number of accidental meetings is huge. Coincidentally, the probe with the POTUS is landing where Oskari made his camp. The freezer pops out of the water where Air Force One incidentally crashed. And you just need to follow a suspicious helicopter on satellite, and you end up looking at POTUS. The criminal Hazar (Mehmet Kurtulus) apparently isn't such a hot-shot criminal afterall, because he doesn't even know how to load an automatic rifle. And the way the satellite images are used in the Pentagon to follow the president, is just hilarious.I admit, It shouldn't always be that serious and occasionally a lightly youth film is also welcome, but there are limits to follies and ridiculous situations. As a boy I'd fall for this blindly. But as an adult, who started watching this film unprepared, it gradually began to annoy me more and more because of the series of stupidities. The final image full of patriotism and heroism ultimately, was a bit too much for me.You gotta cock it, Motherf . Oops.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",negative
Big Game,"I was dragged to this Movie today by my Son. He Dragged me to See Age Of Ultron Last week and even though I'm a fan of Marvel, I thought there was far too much going on in that Movie.But back to this one. Do you remember the old Bruce, Arnie and Stallone Movies before they got old. This is just like those movies. We get Action, Characters to Care about Action. Funny One liners. Action. And we feel good at the end. Did I mention Action.Nobody is going to win and Oscar here but if you like bringing your kids to the movies, this is for you.Great Fun. Just what Movies used to be like.",positive
Marauders,"""I don't care if you smoked last week.What I care about is honesty.If you lie, you withhold facts to get ahead, I'll cut off your balls and bury you.""If you're going to ask me what ""Marauders"" was about, I'll owe you the answer. Because to be honest, this was such a complicated story that I couldn't understand what was happening while watching. Let alone that I could still retell it now. The big jumble of storylines is just as inextricable as a fisherman whose fishing line has become entangled in a bush behind him. However, the beginning was promising. An action-packed and brilliantly filmed bank robbery with the masked robbers working in a concequent way using high-tech gadgets. But unfortunately this is the only thing that causes excitement. The rest is simply too boring and an incomprehensible mess.And who to expect in a mediocre crime/action film? Yep, Bruce Willis is back. This time it's not his lamentable acting that makes him look bad, because he doesn't even get a chance to fail in that. His part is extremely limited, so we only get to see him a few times. And the boredom is easy to read from his facial expression. Although he's the central figure, the only thing he can produce is some doubtfully frowning. That's in line with previous roles he played. The only constant in his career at this moment. His picture on the film poster is bigger than his character in the film.The only character I enjoyed was Christopher Meloni as FBI agent Montgomery. An impressive guy who tries to find out why banks of Hubert International (Bruce Willis is president of) are being robbed. But as I said before, this leads to a fairly complicated tangle of plots and subplots. Before you know it, it's about a failed military operation in Afghanistan where a soldier was killed (or not?), a group of corrupt agents, corruption at a political level and the wife of a policeman who has cancer. Enough to fill a whole season of a new police serial.""Marauders"" is again such a film you better forget about quickly. The only thing that kind of stayed with me, is the fact it rained continuously the entire film.",negative
Marauders,"And there is a least three times where you can actually see the once great actor have the self realisation that he has finally sold out, and is heading toward the same, dead headed career that Seagal has been in for the last 12 years.FBI agents investigating a series of bank robberies initially suspect that the business's owner might be responsible, but they later realise that the heists point toward a much larger conspiracy. As you'd expect by now, Willis has the largest space on the one sheet, but anyone who thinks that he is the lead should take great caution with this, he's merely in it because his name will shift units, and he's a travesty. A complete sell out who is clearly doing this for the money.And I'm ranting because this is an actor who starred in the greatest film ever made (Die Hard), and not only made Hudson Hawk, but survived such a bashing from the critics (and I personally like that film), he then came back to make some wonderful films in the nineties, and even survived Color Of Night.The film itself is terrible, a wannabe Heat featuring a plethora of boring characters, each with their own little vendetta, and a gang of crooks who look like rejects from The Purge films, with some impressive sound effects.But as usual, everyone is suspecting everyone, Willis spends his minutes on screen talking about spiders, and looking like he's girl so etching in his eyes, and Meloni, good as he is, appears to be in a totally different movie.It's poorly made, one scene during a bank raid is so poorly edited, you can actually see the robbers pointing guns one way, when the whole bank (security and all) are standing behind them apparently oblivious to everything.And Jonathan Schaech plays a cop who is married to a woman who likes to wear a bald cap......badly.It's a crying shame that Willis has become such a sell out, because there was no reason for him to resort to such filth like this, he's still A-list, and hopefully this Death Wish remake should give him his motivation back.And before you say 'but it's directed by that hack Eli Roth' don't forget who directed the original........",positive
Dragon Blade,"I was invited to go see the Jackie Chan/Adrian Brody/John Cusack Chinese pseudo-historical period drama called Dragon Blade(though its Chinese title is more along the lines of ""Day of the Lion"" and has nothing to do with dragons or lions... confused yet? Just wait...).In it Jackie Chan plays a guard commander on the Silk Road who absolutely refuses to use violence, which pretty much makes him the worst guard ever. John Cusack plays a super-tired looking Roman General on the run leading a Legion who all speak English but have what is supposed to be a stirring Roman ""national anthem"" which is in Latin. Oh, and even though it's the year 458 BC, Jackie Chan can still speak English... but more Chingrishy than usual (cringing intensifies). Adrian Brody plays a ridiculously evil Consul and was developed by someone who had absolutely no idea what a Roman Consul was and thought it was hereditary, thereby necessitating he kill his father and blind his little brother so that ""he could never take power."" Seriously, dude. You have to get elected every year... and usually have to wait 10 before running again... sigh... . Consul Brody marches an army of 100,000 to conquer the Silk Road which is apparently about a day's hike even though it's like 8,000 miles away. Captain Chan and General Cusack strike up an unlikely and utterly unconvincing friendship to rebuild a city's outer walls, the Romans show how ""smart"" they are by wasting half their schedule constructing huge machines to do the work instead of using the ample labor supply available (it is, after all, a labor camp). The Legion and the ""Silk Road Protection Squad"" have what I thought of as a ""Bring It On"" style dance-off using their respective military drills, than that goes into a sparring match, and then hugs all around. And then they have a singing competition. No. Seriously. They have a singing competition... with a blind kid. In Latin. I made none of this up. . Jackie Chan intermittently goes from being a super-boring goof ball a la everything Chan's ever been in... to the film randomly cutting back to confusing, only-semi-explained flashbacks to when he accidentally suffocated his sister to death as a child, and then stabbed a general in the side who tried to comfort him... all of this leading (somehow) to his deciding to protect the Silk Road using the power of nonviolence forever. Then the ""bad"" Romans show up and the movie turns a 180 and goes into hyper-drive blood, death, and gore. That little blind kid? Thrown off the top of the city wall. John Cusack gets his eyes cut out, is crucified, and then is ""mercifully"" ended by Jackie Chan who breaks form to but an arrow through his neck (he then goes back to letting pretty much any and everyone kill for him and on his behalf until the end). Chan's impossibly-saintly teacher-wife takes 2 arrows in the back. There's a random, gruesome extreme closeup of a Roman soldier taking a Hun arrow in the face *through* a wooden plank. Huns (including the super-hot Lin Peng as Cold Moon), and 30-something other ""races"" all join together to fight the Eeevul Cosul Adrian Brody, and it's like something directly out of The Hobbit #3 with a flipping horde of eagles gouging eyes out, and doomed last stands. . Adrian Brody stabs his grandfather and almost beheads Jackie Chan, but then Chan does something with the weird little arm guard he's worn the whole movie (even though his whole squad is shown to practice with sweet swords that can be thrown and retracted, they are used once, ONCE the whole film. Brody gets his neck slashed, but opt to keep Jackie's kill could at 1 by then taking his dagger and stabbing himself in the heart while mumbling the (completely made up) Roman national anthem again. Then the remaining Romans and the member of the 30-whatever nations all join up to keep the SIlk Road safe and war-free for everyone. .The film is bookended by explorers who find the ruins of the city, and then decide not to tell anyone and keep it a secret... *even though that's their whole job. Their ONLY job.* . The End. . I haven't seen a movie this unfocused, confused, and just... bad... in a long while. If you find yourself in my position, with someone offering you a free ticket... Just. Say. No. Say no to terrible cinematography. . I wish I had extra hands so I could give this movie four thumbs down.",negative
Dragon Blade,"Allow me to start by saying if you are expecting a non stop action fight film....Don't. This film is one build on story not action. The fight scenes are good but not the best for modern day film goers. The film depicts events on the Silk Road involving Chinese, Roman, and other countries who travel and protect this region. I have read other reviews on here concerning this film and give it a low rating due to non-action scenes. This film is not a blow them up and add more dynamite type of film. It makes one think.Jackie Chan has begun a long line of historical films, that have been ranked low on his career but its these films that he is most proud of. They show a history of China and its surrounding regions that most people in the west would never hear of.",positive
War,"Please make sure your brain is on sleep mode when you watch it because this movie:
1. Has no logic. A team goes to fight but only two leads keep on fighting in the most wierd bizzare way by locking popping.
2. Has no thrill - Most of the twists I'm sure you'll figure out before they actually happen.
3. Has different locations, shots, good looking men & women, good clothes, high end bikes & cars, planes which they destroy in a blink.
4. Has unnecessary bike chasing, car chasing, gun fights, airplane chasing, hand fights & plastic surgery. WTF!
5. Gives no idea where Hrithik gets all above stuff when he's a traitor to the nation.
6. Long stares, slow motions, not required dance moves, wierd ways of shooting with both legs in air, unnecessary swag.
7. Has wierd emotions which missed our heads just like the bullet missed Hrithik in one of the fight scenes. (There are too many fight scenes).P.S.: When the missle was already armed towards the ship, why on earth did Hrithik had to go & talk to the two guys whom he ultimately killed in stretched & painful ways?",negative
War,"War is fast paced thriller, hindi reminds you that it's a Bollywood movie. Lets not be biased and appreciate both Hrittik and TIGER , role of Vani as expected is of 15-20 minutes but serves its purpose.

A Taxi Driver,"Acting is incredible. Story is emotional. I typically shay away from foreign language films as I do not have the attention span go watch and read simultaneously for 2 hours.

I would implore people who do not speak Korean to give this film a watch, you will not be disappointed",negative
A Taxi Driver,"Movie: A Taxi Driver (15)Rating: 5/5I've been highly impressed long time by Song Kang-ho, and I've been watching many of his movies since later few months. I was highly excited to watch his new historical action drama A TAXI DRIVER, because the trailer was highly impressive. It showed how the film would turn out to be. I just wanted to see it as soon as possible and I finally got the opportunity. A TAXI DRIVER, without a second thought, is the best South Korean film I've seen till date. From narration to execution to performances to presentation: it's perfect in each and every aspect. The change in the tone of the film has been brought up extremely well, thanks to its director Jang Hoon. The screenplay is never disappointing throughout, and the film comes out as both a refreshing as well as a memorable experience. The film's editing is top notch as it doesn't take much of time to introduce and set up the characters as well as the storyline. As the film progresses, you find yourself connected to the characters, especially the ones of Song Kang-ho and Thomas Kretschmann. Both actors have delivered extremely excellent performances, and rather so excellent that I ended up rooting for them completely. When they smiled, I smiled. When they cried, I cried too. Rest of the supporting cast, especially Ryu Jun-yeol and Yu Hae-jin deserve a lot of praise. The film's technical aspects are top notch. The visuals are breathtaking and the story is well captured by a first-rate cinematography. The film's action sequences are another major highlight, as they induce a lot of excitement along with tension as to what would happen next. The film's not extremely violent, and thus I recommend you to watch it with your family. There's no vulgarity or obscenity in this film.There are plenty of emotional sequences which make the film a totally unforgettable experience. Watch the film and you won't find it difficult to guess which scenes I'm talking about. Various emotional, thrilling as well as action packed sequences have been elevated by the brilliant music. A TAXI DRIVER is a hard-hitting film which must be seen not just for its overall excellence but also for the message it delivers to its viewers. It's hard and almost impossible to forget the film, as you're left highly emotional & impressed by the time the credits start to roll. In short, a perfect masterpiece from South Korea!",positive
The Prince,"My wife and I are huge John Cusak and Bruce Willis fans. This was such a terrible movie that we just had to keep watching in disbelief! There was NOTHING professional about this movie: the writing was a joke, the directing was so bad that we promised each other to keep our eyes out for this director in the future ( if he EVER directs another movie again), so that we NEVER watch another movie he might direct. The acting was awful, but I cannot blame the actors for this. The directing was actually so horrible that he destroyed the performances of John Cusack and Bruce Willis????? How much of an idiot can someone be to pull THAT off? I've never acted or directed anything but I guarantee I could have done a much better job. This director could have done better if he had just shut up and let everyone else make the movie without his input! I'm seriously flabbergasted at this POS waste of time. I'll be asking Comcast for my money back for this excuse for a movie. John and Bruce, wtf were you thinking? Did you agree to be in this POS as a favor to a friend?",negative
The Prince,"The Prince (2014)Ha! A joke. The main character is played by a Bruce Willis wannabe, Jason Patric, and he's decent, barelybut Willis isn't just decent, he's compelling. Still, this movie could have been decent. Barely. But the writing (and direction, overall) are horrid. I mean so unbelievable and amateurish you have to laugh.This is a tough guy movie—Patric plays a guy who is just a nice (handsome) old car mechanic with a cute daughter away in the big city, but he has a past as a super fighter, great with guns and wits. But the writer has him enter a bar and say absurd tough guy things, and then the people around the bar say absurd things back, either tough stuff, too, or just whiny mean stuff. It makes no sense.Of course, you do wish he could save his daughter. And guess what, he does! And kills a lot of people along the way, generally bullet proof in the process. Oh, and his daughter's teenage girlfriend has the hots for him. Etc.Wait, I'm not done! The movie shows Bruce Willis himself as a character! Yup, and he's pretty good, working with a lousy script. John Cusak shows up, too, and is almost pretty good, also with a lousy script. Don't be fooled. This is Patric's movie, and he is at a loss in the mess.",positive
Gantz: O,"Gantz was a good read as a manga because you could skip trough the lamer parts and just view is as a pure action title - which was its strongest part. The fights were entertaining, the art was lovely dark, some of the ideas were actually decently original and the gory 'live or die' policy gave the series a nice feel. This 3DCGI movie on the other hand doesn't really deliver any of that. It does have very successful 3D design and for once the CGI doesn't look too awkward either. Definitely a better pic for that matter than Space Pirate Captain Harlock or Final Fantasy Kinsglaive. As an adaptation, for person like me who is familiar with all of these source materials, I have to say Gantz doesn't work as a stand alone title at all. So others shouldn't bother and Gantz fans will be pleased to some extend at least? I am not sure about that either. This movie is the least mature take on the Gantz franchise for sure. Much like with Berserk Golden Age Arc movies (yes, not the new hideous series, but the movies) - this series seems now like a shonen title aimed for teens while it is originally meant to be mature content for adults. Other than few blood spats and Berserk sex scenes, you will not find much mature and brutal content in them. Some would agree those won't work with CGI well, so it is better not to even try.That leaves me to the question, who is the target audience for this title? I guess the fact that Netflix got it soon after release widely, implies how niche audience we are talking about. On the other hand, I would have never watched this movie if it hadn't been on Netflix recommendations. In the end, I will recommend this piece to everyone who enjoys cyberpunk.",negative
Gantz: O,"Gantz is one of my favourites ( or probably my favourite) manga ever. I've following Hiroya Oku ( the guy who created Gantz) work for years. When i knew about a new Gantz Film coming this year I was very excited but, at the same time, I didn't think that we could watch this film on theatres in Argentina. Well I was wrong, we could due anifest Latin America. What can I say about Gantz O? The animation is AMAZING. The best that i've seen for a long time. The fights, superb . Oka , ""George"" and Nobuo , members of the sadistic and cool Osaka team, have the best fights of the movie. The music fits really well. The Osaka mission is know as one of the best of the manga and it was a really clever choice to pick it up and make a movie about it. About Kato, he is the hero in this movie and you'll end loving him. And the aliens... they're bizarre, scary and really violent. Just like in the manga. To sum up, if you have the opportunity, watch it. Yeah, there're some missing characters, but this movie was so good, so entertaining, that you will forget that in seconds.",positive

Last Knights,"I really wanted to like this, it ticks the boxes (plot wise) of what I like. However, it is truly terrible without any redeeming features. It's like a bunch of vacant morons from Sloane Square just said ""Yah, we should totally make a game of thrones style film"". The acting is beyond bad. The direction and editing is just awful.I'm partial to a 'mediocre, bit of fun' film but this is not that. I always want to like Clive Owen, he has a face that could be great for film but there is just no substance to his acting. Ever.Even Morgan Freeman struggles in this. I truly believe that the look of contempt on his face in the film is for what he's taking part in. He's not acting, he's thinking of firing his agent.Just lost for words. Just truly, truly terrible, shallow, hollow, vacant and......",negative

Occupation,"How this has gotten enough positive reviews to get a 6 rating is beyond me. I don't normally bother to do something like write a review and definitely not a bad one, but this warranted it.It is like they transplanted a Australian 1980's B-movie director to the present day and he tried to condense the TV-series Falling Skies(which is a half-way decent series) into a movie using every cliche imaginable with a sprinkling of Red Dawn on top.If I were to sum it up it is like what could have been a good story was re-told by an over 12 year old boy, skipping ahead when there should have been detail and spending a lot of time elaborating poorly on action scenes.Could have been a good movie and the story is actually not that bad but the way this is made is just.. bad.",positive
Dead Man Down,"Greetings again from the darkness. On the surface, this looks like just another early season crime thriller. From that perspective, it works well enough. However, there are some elements that add complexity and interest, and set this one above the usual. It's directed by Niels Arden Oplev who was responsible for the original (and very cool) Swedish version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. This looks to be his first English language feature and he re-teams with the exciting and talented Noomi Rapace.The film begins with a body in the freezer, and crime boss Alphonse (Terrence Howard) and his crew solving the mystery of who killed his friend and associate. Someone has been tormenting Alphonse with little clues and he falls right into the trap of jumping to conclusions. One member of his crew is Victor (Colin Farrell). We slowly learn more about Victor thanks to an awkward and slow connection between he and his neighbor Beatrice (Ms. Rapace). Their initial acknowledgment of each other is an exchange of waves between balconies. It's an effective visual.The movie bounces between crime thriller and romantic/love story. The added fun of secret missions from both Victor and Beatrice provide the twist this one needs. Actually there are 4-5 exceptional scenes in the movie which make up for the often plodding pace ... not typically a good thing for a thriller. The pieces are greater than the whole, but that doesn't mean it's not an interesting watch.In addition to Farrell, Rapace and Howard, we get some really enjoyable support work from Dominic Cooper, Isabelle Huppert and F Murray Abraham. Ms. Huppert in particular adds a touch of class and humor, and her character could have easily been expanded ... same for Mr. Abraham. Cooper plays an idealistic, but not so observant buddy to Victor and loyal crew member of Howard.This one reminds at times of a couple of Mel Gibson revenge flicks: Payback and Edge of Darkness. What really helps here is the strength of the cast and unusual scars of Victor and Beatrice. A slightly tighter script and improved pacing would have jumped this one a level or two.",negative
Dead Man Down,"This was unexpected , title steers you in a a different direction , i think who ever named this movie is responsible of putting it in big handicap position which this movie doesn't deserve . Most of the bad reviews are caused by this , people looking for a quick gangsta movie and being disappointed by the complexity and sheer humanity of this movie. The acting deserves a mention too , Farell was very compelling , hard to read in the beginning but managed to convey emotion which has become so rare these days, also great job done by the whole cast , credible and real acting and well written story. Definitely a movie i will put in my collection and watch it again with pleasure.",positive
Once Upon a Time in Venice,"The other reviewer gave a horrible score calling it ""average,"" but compared to all the other garbage coming out lately it is a gem.

If I wasn't laughing, I was at least grinning throughout the movie. Great casting with a surprising number of (old) A-listers throughout.

Once Upon a Time in Venice,I eventually turned this off. (hence the 1 out of 10) I gave it over an hour to actually captivate me but it failed so dramatically that I turned off in anger.This movie tries so hard and fails so hard. It tries hard to be funny and you end up feeling like you're watching a 5 year old making jokes. It tries too hard to be smart but it takes a smart person to make a smart script and not look like they're a Mr smartypants wannabee. This person is a Mr smartypants wannabee. It tries too hard to be sexy and just looks Chauvinistic.There was some potential here but completely lost.,positive
Survivor,"I couldn't even finish the movie. She is supposed to be a security expert and doesn't know anything about keeping herself safe. I'm certainly not a security expert by any means but I do have some common sense. She doesn't put the scarf around her head to mask her face, she knows cameras are there but looks straight into them. She goes to predictable places, finds her friends to help her making them targets. She doesn't get rid of the tracking chip that's in her ID. She doesn't show an ounce of actual emotion throughout any of the movie. After running from the Ambassador, almost getting shot and then almost getting killed by the Pierce's character, she runs home and then cuddles with Sam. She seeks him get killed and barely reacts other than running away. Sure she can make the phone jiggle when she's ""scared"" but that's as believable as it gets. Yikes.",negative
Survivor,I am shocked at some of the reviews. The movie grabs you from the start and keeps you involved and waiting for the next action packed scene. Brosnan is truly believable in his role and so are all of the other cast members. Yes it does have some..well in real life it might not happen this way..but overall a cliff hanger..Demonstrates the corruption that can lead to terrorist attacks in our system. And how easily the person who is the most patriotic can be turns on and condemned and sees as a problem instead. I was on the edge of my seat..great acting and a great script. Okay I'm a Brosnan fan and loved the fact that he could play this role with such conviction and good acting..Obviously he should still be James Bond instead of you know who.,positive

At one point theres a hurricane outside but they have their windows open like its a sunny day! They can open doors and things with ease! Its so fake its funny.As for the end! It looks like some sort of tornado is chasing them. They're supposed to be in the eye of the storm so how do they manage to outrun the storm? They should hit the other side of the eye!

"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny","To be clear, this movie shares a bit of a plot with the first, however the two are very different.

My biggest disappointments come from terrible music score, why not just use the same one or maybe an altered arrangement? the score is generic martial arts movie.Secondly, far too much CGI, from fights, to stunts to locations. Just very jarring.Overall, this movie just tried so so hard to be more epic than the first, however lacked a vision, a poetic feeling and spiritual message like the first. Enjoy it for some brainless fun and some OK fight scenes, but don't expect it to be anything like the first.",negative
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny","I don't know how they could take a masterpiece like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and destroyed it. This sequel has nothing of the first movie except for the title. Maybe i am too harsh, but Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was an epic movie, with good story line, legendary character in Li My Bai, great chemistry between characters and epic ending. So based on that my expectations for this movie were high. Plus if you put Donnie Yen, and Jason Scott Lee on top of that you would expect nothing less than the previous movie. But, no. In CTHD 2, the story is terrible, the characters are weak, empty and shallow,there is no connection between them, the directing is bad, and the worst part is, it's in English. The only good thing are the fighting scenes and they are average at best.So to summarize this movie is an average Chinese kung fu movie with some decent action, sword fighting scenes. As a Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon sequel its a big disappointment and not worth watching.",positive
USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage,"The single scene in the movie Jaws where Robert Shaw scares the crap out of Richard Dreyfus as he describes the sinking of the USS Indianapolis and the terrifying shark aftermath, has more truth, terror, realism and great acting than the entire movie USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage. This film's amazing true story was hijacked along the way to make room for fictional back lines of power, love and racial tensions that all fall flat. Anachronisms abound--FNG is from the Vietnam war, the neon sign is not of the period, and Wayne Gretzky wouldn't make his ""miss 100 shots you don't take"" quote for another 50 years. It's like the scriptwriter used Google to write the script but forgot to use Google to fact check it. I wanted to like this movie, to pass along a great history lesson to my son watching with me, but from the first wobbly special effect to when we gave up and went to bed as the wrong shark species showed up, USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage never failed to disappoint. At least we know how it ends and at least there's Google to get it right and Jaws to tell it better.",negative
USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage,"The USS Indianapolis was one of the Navy's older Cruisers and served with much distinction. My Ens. David A Jump was a crew member on the ill fated Indy. The movie story is pretty much the way we were told as to what happened to the ship and the crew. My uncle died aboard the ship with the 1st torpedo attach. The story about what happened to Cpt. McVay is very real. The Navy didn't let the families know what really happened so many people hated Cpt. McVay and blamed him for the loss. The movie has historical value. It is well documented that the Japanese Commander did testify at the trial and he and McVay did meet each other. The loss of the Indy crew should never have happened. The Navy should have had better contact with the ship and when it didn't arrive at the next stop, the SOS should have been looked at much closer. It was known that the Japanese sub was in the path of the USS Indianapolis.",positive
Outcast,"I went into this expecting crap, and I guess there are lots of weird things in the film.For example, it bypasses the language barrier by giving everyone involved the universal translator, and the Chinese characters speak English in distinctly British accents, wtf.Also, it combines elements of both the Crusades and Chinese Imperial stuff into a single film, which was interesting.Hayden Christensen punches a woman in the face. I found that funny, considering the nobody made a fit about ""violence against women omagazz"". Then again, the film does depict lots of women and some children being slaughtered, it probably would've gotten a pg13 for that if the censors got their hands onto it.The dialog is somewhat cliché, then you also have the white savior cliché in which Nick Cage and Hayden Christensen kick Chinese ass to save Chinese people from other Chinese people, but I'm cool with that. But honestly, the film does in fact fulfill its duty to entertain. There are lots of sword fights, some cool (although anticlimactic) arrow scenes, and a nice supply of blood, but not in a particularly gory way.The story is somewhat nonsensical, I guess the only defense to that is 'who cares'.Over all though, it still was kinda FUN, nothing really made me cringe, and the Chinese theme in a non Chinese film is somewhat refreshing. So my final verdict is: 6/10 fun but not particularly memorable.",negative
Outcast,"Wooden acting, predictable plot and poor cinematography. American imports with bad accents in a Canadian production with Chinese money. Guilt ridden ex crusaders in China save Prince.I think the entire movie is summed up by the final scene were the camera pans up to sky. The entire crew must have breathed a collective sigh of relief that the nightmare was over.Clearly made for a DVD release I doubt this one will ever even make it to TV, it's that bad. I agree with previous reviewers that the fight scenes are not badly done, camera angles and tight shots tend to spoil it, its not meant to be an art film. There are too many examples of hero versus 20 guys that wait their turn, surely this fell out of favor as a fight choreography 25 years ago.Don't waste your time or money.",positive
Ip Man 3,"Like other Chinese movies, you see the beginning and know the ending. A hero representing the Chinese martial arts have to fight against other fighters and he always wins (like a superman).I expected a better movie but I was aware that I had wasted my time to come to theatre to see it. It seems that the director never wants to change their mind to bring this kind of movie goes out of Asia. The main character faces to fighters from low level to high level (level 1 - 2 - 3 - 5). The way he lives looks like the way of a perfect person that no one else could be better! And that's all about kung fu Chinese movies of all time.Not sure how this movie could come up to 8.0 (1k reviews) but I guess that 1k Chinese users tried to vote it up :)",negative
Ip Man 3,"I will try to keep this spoiler free. Donnie Yen returns for Ip Man 3, and despite being produced by the same team, the theme that is explored... is that much deeper. Ip Man focuses on ""Survival"", Ip Man 2 focuses on Everyday Life and Making a Living, while Ip Man 3 focuses on ""Life"" itself.The audience will need to pay attention to details to enjoy the movie fully, starting from the first scene, and really understand how the first scene relates to the whole story. So... REMEMBER the first scene! (The Butterfly Scene)There are subtle hints hidden in the move, be it Bruce Lee's quote of ""Be Like Water"" or ""One-Inch Punch"" where viewers really need to pay attention to the story and choreography to understand.Ip Man 1 and 2 focuses on grounded action, and realistic choreography. Ip Man 3 has that, but added another layer of beauty to the movie, thanks to Yuen Woo Ping(Matrix, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon)'s choreography. The details of every fight scene can be enjoyed and explored. While many think that Ip Man 3 will be just a martial arts exhibition, but the team managed to bring in a layer of emotion we have not seen in 1 and 2. Donnie's Ip Man is now a much more grounded, humble and just that neighborhood family guy we all love. Donnie Yen's performance here is nothing sort of amazing.Lynn Hung's performance is also outstanding.All in all, the movie may not please all critics and fans who ONLY loves hard-hitting action, but if you are looking at an Ip Man movie with Great action, great humour and that sense of touch with a love story, then Ip Man 3 is the best in the series.",positive
Barely Lethal,"Desperate to experience the 'normal' adolescence of teen movies such as 'Bring It On' and 'Clueless', a teenage assassin flees the institution that trained her and enrolls in a local high school in this action comedy starring Hailee Steinfeld of 'True Grit' fame. The premise is ripe with potential and the film gets one of its best lines early on as Steinfeld tells a group of genuinely friendly cheerleaders ""I've seen 'Mean Girls'... twice!"", however, not enough is made from the notion of Steinfeld navigating her way through the high school experience based on movie clichés. Most perplexingly, she fails to pick up on the 'love is closer than you think' cliché with Thomas Mann doing the best he can in a thankless turn as the kind-hearted tech geek who has to wait the whole movie before Steinfeld realises that she wants him. The film also never quite maximises the potential of all her assassin training with the bits where she inadvertently hurts others few and far between. The fake slang that the teenagers use in the film is incredibly irksome too. There is a great running gag though with young Jason Drucker constantly finding weapons and gadgetry that Steinfeld has stashed. There is also a very funny bit in which Steinfeld and a friend discuss killing just like two normal teens discussing sex; ""the first time should be special""! As for Steinfeld herself, she is engaging throughout. The best performance though comes from Rob Huebel channeling Eugene Levy in 'American Pie' as Mann's wannabe hip father who keeps trying to discuss girls with him in detail.",negative
Barely Lethal,"Candy coated, sure, but not without poignancy. Above-par acting and a great cast elevate this slightly formulaic farce. Close your cold hard eye and have fun with this one.

Slow West,"I'm a huge fan of the Western genre. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is one of my all time favorite films and I'm always on the lookout for a modern western that can kick-start the genre. I was hoping this would be the film but unfortunately I don't think most people will find it appealing. The acting is top notch, especially from Fassbender and Mendelsohn, but ultimately the pace and the melancholic ending will leave most people wanting more. If you liked the look and feel of The Homesman or the slow burn of Meek's Cutoff check this film out. If your looking for an action western with a Hollywood ending then this is a film you should skip.",negative
Slow West,"This is my first review, I wanted to save it for a movie that I was touched by and one that gave me something I didn't expect, in essence a film that gave me everything that I thought it wouldn't. Slow West magnificently portrays the human condition, with all it's defects and strengths. It rather wonderfully and in a very subtle way exposes it's capacity for love and betrayal, loyalty and mistrust, fear and courage. It reveals to us that desperate good people do terrible things to survive in hard times, how hard bitten and essentially broken souls have the means and wherewithal to do good and be forgiving. It shows how we can be innocent and naive and yet still be able to teach, how we can be overly aggressive and yet protective, greedy yet also so very giving. The true wonder of this film is to me is that it exposes to us that all of us can be all of the above at some point in our lives, that we all have the capacity for evil or good and sometimes it is only circumstance that turns us either onto or away from a particular path. It's theme to me is the delicate balance between success and death in the American west during that period from the standpoint of choices made, and to my mind I think it succeeds in portraying this exceptionally well.Many of the reviews I have read on here in regards to this film say it is far too slow, I don't think it is at all, it is a journey, a gradual layering of the story building to a climax, it is not supposed to be action and bells and whistles from the off, I think it is a film that ultimately is trying to make you think; you are invited to explore who we are and what we are capable of as humans in hostile conditions. The performances are excellent all round, the thoroughly underrated Ben Medelsohn particularly as the 'realist' outlaw and Michael Fassbender who commands the screen in all his scenes, as he so often does. I think the writing of the dialogue is fantastic and nuanced, the humour dry and cleverly interspersed and the attention to period detail almost faultless. My only gripe is that there are a couple of scenes that don't seem to fit the narrative, maybe that is what slows this film down for some.I understand that that this kind of western or period drama for that matter is not to everyones taste, that for many 'action' is the byword by which these films stand or fall, well to that I say to each their own. If however you are keen to watch a movie that attempts to reflect back to you just what it means to be a person with all a persons flaws, and how circumstance can shape us into the judged or judgemental, then this very well may be a worthwhile watch for you.",positive
Cooties,"I can honestly say I hated 'Cooties'' within the first five minutes.When you make a horror/comedy, and the comedy falls flat on every level, you're in for a very long 90 minutes. I can imagine people walking out of this one around the 15 minute mark, because that's when my limit of stupidity had reach it's maximum capacity. There just isn't enough horror to make up for the rest of the film. The acting is some of the worst I've seen all year. Maybe the worst. Alison Pill and Jack McBrayer are worthy of a Razzie nomination, at the very least. They give hands down the worst performances you're going to see in any film this year. Elijah Wood is terribly miscast, as he's inserted into a role that would be best played by Adam Sandler. That's right, Elijah Wood, you get a pass on this one. Words cannot describe how bad the dialogue is, so I won't even try. You'll just have to experience it for yourself. My apologies.The best way to describe this awful film, is that it's something you'd expect from Adam Sandler - and I'm curious how and why he missed the boat here. Maybe he was busy with 'Pixels?' I am just baffled how a film this bad can get any type of positive feedback, as it is complete and utter trash. Do yourself a favor and check out 'Bloodsucking Bastards' instead. Random Ramblings of a Madman: Out of all my reviews, this is the only review where I'm curious to see how many down votes I receive. Because it tells me that somewhere out there is a person or persons who actually enjoyed 'Cooties.' And that will be funnier than anything I experienced in the film itself. Thank you.",negative
Cooties,"Clint (Elijah Wood) goes to his old school, Fort Chicken elementary school, Illinois (GO FIGHTING ROOSTERS!) as a substitute teacher. He meets Lucy (Alison Pill) an old friend who has trouble with normal conversations. Her boyfriend is the PE teacher Wade (Rainn Wilson) who owns a truck with duo rear wheels. The film introduces us to a number of quirky characters and kids that are not that adorable. Due to a viral breakout caused by processed chicken nuggets (I tossed mine out after seeing how nuggets are made from pink paste) the children turn into blood thirsty zombies who attack in hordes with some limited mental capacities.The film spoofs formula writing: dress up montage; guy who is way too smart; self-sacrifice individual; climbing through the vent duct; and a reference to a previous film...""Sneak around like a little Hobbit.""This is a funny zombie style cult film.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",positive
Son of a Gun,Disappointing for me. This movie had the makings of a classic only for the childish love story that takes over and smothers a Point Break style action bonanza. Could have been a classic!! Ewan Mcgregor was a convincing robber/good/bad guy and I would like to see him take grittier roles in the future. The young buck that the movie revolves around was convincing and an interesting character until he got caught up in an overly predictable love story. The Start was gripping but quickly starts going downhill. Who is the writer trying to impress exactly? Started a lads movie and ended a chick flick. The young dude has potential and I am sure we will see him again.,negative
Son of a Gun,"Movie packed with a little scent of action-drama of the 1970s. This Australian movie gets better as it is unfolded.Good acting, good photography and a brief dose of humanity and thriving. Even if the script is nothing out of the normal, the film itself shows us a fast-driven story of convicted criminals trying to live under a small ""mafia"" organization - Love, lust, betrayal, death and commiseration will be the ingredients to cook up this story.PS-> Don't watch the trailer because it sucks and deviates you from seeing a good movie. (I avoided myself from viewing trailers years ago for any movie) - They are simple a pure commercial beacon that use the best scenes as a vehicle of opportunism to forge you into seeing something that ultimately it does not translate into what you are expecting.",positive
Black Sea,"This film is about a submarine captain who is fired because of downsizing. He decides to form his own submarine team to hunt for the gold that Nazi Germany is rumoured to have left in a sunken submarine at the bottom of the Black Sea.I was initially put off by ""Black Sea"" because of the heavy accent, which made it hard for me to understand the dialog. Fortunately, the film is thrilling and captivating, so I was drawn by the film again. The plot keeps me on the edge because there is something happening in rapid succession. The divide between the British and the Russian crew is well portrayed. There are even mind games which is probably unexpected in a submarine thriller. The claustrophobic environment of the submarine, and also the constant fear of catastrophic events happening keep the adrenaline pumping. The ending is unexpectedly moving, I was very sympathetic towards the characters. It even gave me tingles down my body. I enjoyed watching ""Black Sea"".",negative
Black Sea,"As a former submarine sailor I watch every submarine picture that is exhibited. None are exactly as it was or is. Most are a lot of fun to watch. This movie was very good as it entertained and kept you on the edge of your seat. This is a good escape from all the movies that are all explosions, blood and gore, fantasy, and vampire trash. This has a believable storyline even if the FX are a little unbelievable. You should watch this movie and enjoy it. Jude law is surprising in the role of the Capt. and is a great deal different than previous movie roles for him. The clash of personalities adds to the excitement through danger and mechanical malfunctions.",positive
Yoga Hosers,"In the 90's, Kevin Smith became an icon with ""Clerks"", ""Malllrats"" ""Chasing Amy"" and ""Dogma"". Unfortunately along his next works, he has never reached the same success again.""Yoga Hosers"" is probably the bottom of his career, with an unfunny and annoying story. His daughter and Johnny Depp's daughter acting are terrible and they only had this chance because of the influence of their fathers with the producers. The name of Johnny Depp is embarrassing and used to lure the viewers. In the end, ""Yoga Haters"" is a means to spend 88 minutes of your life watching a comedy without laughing. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): Not available",negative

True Memoirs of an International Assassin,"This film tells the story of a man who struggles to write his first novel, which is about an assassin. When his book is released, his agent promoted his novel as a true story. Venezuelans abduct him and hence he gets involved in coups and assassination plans involving multiple fractions of the country.This is the first film I watched in 4K on my TV, and the picture quality is crystal clear. Yet, the mesmerising picture quality does not make up for the silly story. What happens in the story is very unrealistic and at times downright silly. However, there are a few moments when it is funny, such as the two CIA agents chatting in their office about the author. ""True Memoirs of an International Assassin"" is made to be a genuine brain-off entertainment.",negative
True Memoirs of an International Assassin,"I give this movie a perfect rating and here is why. I think movies should be judged in terms of what they set out to succeed. Movies should be judged within their own genres. There are few movies that exist that incorporate every genre and viewers should not expect a movie to be all things at once.That being said...this movie incorporates two genres, those genres being action and comedy. Withing the action-comedy genre this movie is completely without fault. This movie tries to succeed at being an action comedy and it does succeed, brilliantly. Hilarious male lead with his usual brand of slapstick humor but this time in a less self depreciating way, I like his brand of humor in an action setting, no fat jokes and more stylish action choreography. Good chemistry with the believably badass female lead. I do not know if she used a body double for the fight scenes but it was impressive either way. There are multiple villains and you never know which one is truly bad or good so there are some nice little twists there.I grew up in the 80s and lived on action flicks so this movie was awesome! Also I am not a fan of endless sex jokes and crude humor and this movie had non of it, just hilarious situations and slapstick action comedy at its best! I will not give away to much of the story because it is pretty simple to follow. Go watch it!",positive

Although there are quite a few stars, or at least well know actors in the movie, this is a huge let down. If you value your time, i advise you not to watch it. And you want to know whats even worse? I cant believe they planned it to actually have a sequel! The only good thing about this movie is that it lasts 90 min, so even though it pains to watch, it doesn't last that long.",negative

The Colony,"By the looks of the trailers, I actually had a slight hope for this flick. I'm a sucker for survival-movies and it starred Fishbourne and Paxton, cool right? No! This movie had everything going for it, but they managed to ruin it.First of all, how did Fishbourne and Paxton do? They did alright, it's just that their characters are horrible clichés. Fishbourne is obviously the wise, great leader everybody loves and Paxton is his counter-part. A trigger-happy redneck who wants to have a tighter regime among the survivors, this character could be exciting, but with no development nor a lot of screen-time, he becomes too boring..Speaking of survivors, I forgot to mention the 'Day after tomorrow'-plot here. We get to know that it just started snowing, that's why the entire globe has entered a new ice age, well okay, now I feel wiser. The plot is also told though the narration of the protagonist Sam, who looks a lot like Emile Hirsch, just more wooden. After receiving a distress call from another group of survivors, Fishbourne, Sam and some random dead- beat who brings pornography on expeditions (Fishbourne even asks if he wants to be alone when he pulls the magazine out, I'm not kidding)goes to investigate. After they find a skinnier version of Sharlto Copley, we meet the bad guys, who are basically a bunch of exaggerated orcs. The movie also tries to create some minor sub-plots, but fails. The tedious nightmare with flashbacks from Sam's childhood doesn't add anything to the story, and is explained by Fishbourne after 30 minutes, there goes the potential mystery. I must admit this film is on the verge of becoming a B-movie. The effects are horrendous, the camera gets a seizure during the fight- scenes and the ending was predicted during the first five minutes. It's sad to see such great actors get involved in garbage such as this now a days.",negative
The Colony,"If you have an affinity for movies like The Warriors, Mad Max, Carpenter's The Thing, Craven's The Hills Have Eyes, you will be game for this fun b-movie. Imaginative and well-paced. Don't expect a 100 million dollar special-effects extravaganza with every little detail and character fleshed out to the extreme. That's not what these type of movies are for. The Colony is an economically told, well written, nicely shot, low-budget affair with engaging performances from all. You'll be surprised and impressed with how much the filmmakers accomplished with less than 20 million dollars. The authenticity of the underground colony is great (it doesn't feel like a film set) considering they filmed at the decommissioned NORAD facility in Northern Ontario.",positive
MI-5,"This Spy-Action Thriller film for me, enters the top 50 rubbish films of the last decade. It just could not have been any slower, brutal acting, incorrect character to actor placements, wafer thin story line. I mean seriously, who approves budgets for these movies? If you want a Movie that would have better placed as a series, then this film might just be for you.I reached a point of skipping the Movie forward in blocks about 3rd way into it. Would not recommend this film even in DVD format, no wonder it appeared and disappeared off screen so quickly. Promoters have again done an impetuous job here advertising and portraying film greatness when in fact the film itself demonstrates the opposite. Shockingly the IMDb rating is higher than 50% for this movie, I am shocked... Did a lot of people rate incorrectly?From me, Stay clear or prepare to Yawn.",negative

Decent action movie though...you might like it if you're a fan of the Rock.",negative
Snitch,"Another plane journey another film that never appealed to me before but seemed good enough to fill some hours with not much else to do. Based on a true story this film sees a working man getting drawn into a drug sting operation in return for reduced time for his son, who was also innocently drawn into a drug dealing charge. In terms of narrative what we get is fairly events-driven and obvious; characters get put in danger, drug dealers are only marginally less trustworthy than the authorities, families are under stress and so on.As a story it does the job but doesn't deliver anything other than what you expect – even without knowing the story you probably already know the story since it does more or less what you think it will. In terms of what happens there are not too many opportunities for set-pieces but the film should be able to really hatchet up the tension given what is at stake. Unfortunately it doesn't ever really do this – moments of intense danger seem staged and although there are manly confrontations there isn't too much sustained pressure that translated across to the viewer. This failing leaves the film feeling a bit pedestrian even if it does enough to engage to a certain degree.The cast help it, in particular the presence of Johnson. He is not a great actor but he is more than enough of a presence to make a difference; I've always found he has an easy charisma and this is another example of that working in the favor of the project. Supporting cast is less reliable even if there are some big names and faces in there such as Sarandon, Bernthal, Pepper, Williams, Velazquez and others. Bratt stars as the main threat but beyond looking a bit sinister he really does do anything of note.Snitch is a decent enough story told in a workmanlike fashion. It benefits from some good performances but it is still only a so-so watch and nothing more than that.",positive

Ride Along 2,"I Have to admit I was suckered in by the trailer, it was exciting and action packed. I thought they were doing a Bad Boys style movie, boy was I wrong. This was like a long TV episode of an American crime show like NCIS, Hawaii Five-O, or CSI but not as intriguing or engaging.All the action is in the trailer. There's about 3 action scenes and all 3 are not that new or good, they're the type you'd see in standard TV shows. There's some poor computer game animation mixed into one action sequence(cus Kevin Hart's character loves to play computer games) which totally ruins the rhythm of that action sequence and ruins the enjoyment of it. The end action sequence looks like they couldn't be bothered, something you would have gotten in a straight-to-video 80s/90s action flick.It wasn't a good comedy either, there was about 3-4 little chuckles throughout from some of the audience including myself for some of the one liners. I read before i went in to watch this sequel that it was more of an actioner than comedy but for me it didn't deliver in either.I wasn't expecting anything new or groundbreaking storywise but at least give me something to keep me interested but its a film that came across as if they took scenes from loads of other similar films and just copy/pasted them together.It all just looked WAY too familiar and not in a good way.So overall i don't see any reason to recommend paying hard earned money to watch it at the cinema. I'd recommend waiting until it comes on TV,as it is like a TV episode anyway. Then at least you can switch over to another channel if your not feeling it.If you do want to go to the cinema to watch a comedy then i would definitely recommend DADDY'S HOME if it's still out, very very funny, you will defo leave with a smile on your face.But if your really in the mood for an action-comedy then i would recommend SPY,which was out in 2015 and is out on DVD now.

Blood Ties,"This cast is great and it's my favorite type of film: crime, brothers on either side of the law, and a bit of romance on the side. However, this movie proves why Scorcese is Scorcese. He does the exact same kind of story lines and with the same top notch actors but he makes his long movies go by so quickly. This movie just drags on and on and you know what's going to happen before any of the scenes there's no surprises and I care nothing for any of the characters. The acting is fine, the actors did an okay job, but it's just boring. Hood gets out of town, falls for girl who wants him to do well. He tries, he fails, he turn back to crime. There's a past relationship and of course it teases him. There's a dying father, a cop brother who wants him to do good. He just can't handle life on the outside. There's nothing wrong with the story but the dialogue is cheesy and the movie just doesn't flow. It's like time slows down and I'm watching this frame by boring frame. Don't waste your time on this one and rewatch Goodfellas if you're hankering for a gangster film.",negative
Blood Ties,"It's truly a shame that a piece of cinematic filth like ""American Hustle"" is recognized as a legitimate 70s throwback gangster film. It's even more despicable that it wins/nominated for awards. I can't emphasize just how poor of a film that is. Blood Ties is everything that American Hustle is supposed to be. Amazing acting, amazing character depth, Clive Owen is amazing as usual. The 70s cars, music, everything is perfect. This movie is 1000 times better than watching Bale mumble and stumble around in his fat cheesy wardrobe for 2 hours. The other guy from Sliver linings movie and Hangover, is such a poor poor actor it's laughable. Any way, this is about Blood Ties. It excels as a gangster/cop movie. It's authentic. It's a shame that this movie will win no awards and will linger with a 6ish rating on here when it is 1000 times better than American Hustle....God that movie is horrible.I personally hope that this movie was made specifically to show how awful American Hustle is. The Director must have.",positive
Vikram Vedha,"It's an okay movie. Even going by the Indian cinema standards this is hardly a 7 and nowhere close to being a 8.5 rating, such high ratings to a mediocre movie is an insult to the ones that actually deserve it. The story is unnecessarily stretched out, and many of the sub plots of the movie actually make no sense and doesn't have any effect on the outcome. Like the banter with the Vikram and his wife, has absolutely no effect to the main plot. And whole team is corrupted and accepting bribes and spending lakhs openly, but no one is even raising the question as to how they are getting the money and head of the team who is supposedly smart is absolutely clueless about this happening right in front of him. And Vedha is like, why are the cops only killing my gang members, I don't understand but I'll get arrested and tell the cop who killed my innocent brother a story. Not to forget who easily this movie wants the viewers to sympathise with criminals and gangsters, oh my dear innocent brother was shot, he was no gangster, he just did Hawala, converted black to white. Such poor innocent soul. My as*, this movie tried to be smart but fails on so many things and for anyone with an IQ in triple digits and has seen a bunch of good TV and cinema can easily deduce the plot. This is just below average.",negative
Vikram Vedha,"11 lessons to be learnt from the crime thriller movie ""Vikram Vedha"".1) What you do is always not right. Killed Puli without knowing whether he is a criminal or not, but rewarded him as criminal, who is actually an innocent soul.2) Don't guess things without knowing what exactly happened. Vikram guessed Simon was killed by Vedha because under Simon's order the encounter took place where Puli was shot by him.3) Don't trust anyone who is with you. Vedha and Vedha's brother was targeted to be killed by Ravi. Simon was killed by his own cop brothers. Vikram too was about to be killed by his great cop mates.4) Police are always not right. Criminals are not always wrong.5) You can't guess anyone by seeing their eyes. Vikram didn't believe when Vedha said Simon worked for Ravi. Vikram can't find out his own team mates killed Simon.6) Don't see a thing from one point of view all the time. Vikram had an imagination that Simon was killed by Chandra. But he never had a thought that even his cop friends could have done that for the sake of money.7) Not everyone who helps you is true to you. Vikram's encounter team was helping him to accomplish the task of encountering Vedha. But Vikram never knew they wanted to do this task just for money.8) A person can even act as if he is innocent just to make his job done. The new member of the team acted as if he is innocent to Vikram. In the climax when Vikram asked him to give cover, he pulled off the innocent mask and aimed the gun at Vikram itself.9) Business/work and friendship can't co-exist peacefully. Chetta ordered to kill Chandra because she tried to escape with his money. Ravi wanted to kill Vedha even while working for him.10) Don't relate your personal life with your work. Priya never helped Vikram, when he asked, he wanted to know the place of Vedha. Profession can't be compromised for personal things.11) Criminal/Police have a human heart. Vikram was keen to find Vedha and kill him in an encounter. If not in an encounter, he will escape. But, in the climax the great gangster Vedha helped the true police by saving his life. Vikram shot all his team mates in hands and legs so that they will be alive, but killed the unit head who turned all his friends to work for him.",positive
The Rover,"Excellent acting and marvelous photography are wasted on a script that has no focus and a musical score that suggests aboriginal influences which are not otherwise present. Literally every actor in this film delivers excellent performances, even the people with minor parts.As a post-apocalyptic film, the script offers very little new, and there are many inconsistencies that may be attributed to the Australian location. But this is no ""Mad Max"", and that's a shame.One of the core problems of the film is that there isn't anyone to root for, apart from a few transitory characters. The main characters are bad, very bad, and pathetic.Another problem with the film is the long ECUs. Generally speaking, long ECUs can serve a useful purpose, as they do in Leone's films. But less is more, and in this case, more is less.",negative
The Rover,"Just like the mud and the dust on the characters in the film, the excellent The Rover gets under the skin and remains there, long after the screen went black.The story takes place in the Australian outback in the near future after a collapse. A bitter loner sees his car stolen by a gang and tries to get it back at all cost with the help of the wounded, simple brother of a gang member, left behind after a disastrous robbery.Slow and intense The Rover sucks you into the desert, you can almost feel the heat and the flies in your face. Few words are used, more is said by gunshots. Here are no action heroes who at the end clean up the mess, restore the order and peace and let you leave theater with the feeling that you were nicely entertained. The people in The Rover are desperate to such extent that they've almost become indifferent towards life. They try to survive, period.The bizarre relationship between the angry loner Eric and the naive, dependent Rey is wonderfully brought on screen. Both Guy Pearce and Robert Pattinson deliver brilliant performances. Guy embodies perfectly the bitter,rude, inner wounded Eric with his body language and the intense gaze . Robert disappears into Rey, a damaged rather innocent soul who IMO has been taught to blindly obey and not to think for himself, in a way that will blow people away. The tics and blinks belong to Rey, you see them disappear when he feels more at ease, reappear in situations of stress. The supporting actors are amazing as well.Although the film is dark, the mood is not cold IMO. Under the surface of alienation and cruelty there's a palpable emotional layer of vulnerability and fear. Michôd created a world frighteningly realistic and raw, a world we, civilized people, in fact don't want to face. With his second movie David shows again how incredibly talented he is. I was eagerly anticipating The Rover and it met all my expectations. The performances alone is pure enjoyment together with the beautiful landscapes and the amazing music score. Some scenes are quite funny like Rey trying to do his best to be a good partner, or when he's singing.There's also a lot to think about after watching The Rover. What collapse can cause such situation? How far are civilized people willing to go when there's nothing left to loose? Is Rey mentally disabled or is he the product of a very unfavorable education?And why did I think about Animal Kingdom after The Rover had finished? See the movie and you'll know. Sorry for mistakes, English isn't my native language.",positive
The Mountain II,"I was the one who was thinking about this movie as predictable and cliché besides I have never seen a good military movie from Turkey except one or two films (e.g. Nefes). However I must say , this movie is quite successful with respect to other Turkish or high budget Hollywood films. Furthermore , visual effects are pretty good at overall. Scenario includes not only war or strategic stuff but also amusement and drama.Beside It has actual topics like conflict between religions or beliefs of native people or minorities all over the middle east. Moreover it touches on ISIS factor properly and objectively.",negative
The Mountain II,"I've seen the movie just a bit earlier and although my expectations were very high, this movie satisfied me very well. As we already know Turkish movie sector has lack of visual effects. That is actually the reason behind why we usually don't enjoy Turkish Action kind of films. But in this movie we see lots of great examples of best visual effects. And also it has its own realistic scenes as well. The connection between soldiers were so great, enthusiastic and natural. Also the connection between the first movie with this one was great so this movie actually deserves its rate. Besides from good visual and sound effects the movie has also its own story-line which was perfect. As I mentioned before even though my expectations were really high this movie is even beyond my expectations. Thanks for letting us joy this kind of masterpiece Mr. Alper Caglar.",positive
Momentum,Excellent movie night selection. And I'm pleased to see a woman get top billing for a change.,negative
Momentum,"Before watching I had no expectations. Luckely. If I had I might have given it a worse rating. It is what it is: a lower (not low) budget action movie. As such its good enough. Sure, the plot is thin. Sure, the dialogues are predictable. Sure, the bad guys have the obligated looks and accent. Sure, it has flaws. But it delivers what you might hope for: speed, action, a car chase, gunfights, a good looking heroin (Olga Kurylenko's acting was not half as bad as I feared) It even has some suspence, a few twists and as a bonus a small role for Morgan Freeman. It will not win prices but it's a fun movie to watch on a rainy day.",positive
In the Blood,"In The Blood starring Gina Carano remains a work in progress as an actress, but has an undeniable screen presence. She's obviously gifted with the physical stuff in action scenes, but also has a charm that works well in reactive situations. Soderbergh knew how to harness this in ""Haywire"" for scenes of coiled danger, and there's a sequence in In the Blood where a handcuffed Ava coaxes a police officer into escorting her to the bathroom, which we know won't end well for him. Other times, however, since the film is so much in service of her as a proactive dispenser of pain unto others, In the Blood struggles to maintain a connection amidst its forward-leaning momentum, however as a one time watch, the film holds up. Do not take the film as serious but it is quite a mysterious thrill ride. Compared to Taken, this film isn't it but for sure does share certain similarities in its premise. Gina Carano can he a threat in the future but she needs a big break through. Haywire put her up their as an audience but she needs something else.",negative
In the Blood,"I am impressed with the thoughtful actions of Gina Carano. I feel I have found a new and fantastic female hero. I hope there will be more to come from her. What is it with Danny Trejo? He is in every other movie these days. Gina Carano has strength and power in her punches and isn't taking ""NO"" for an answer as she goes thru every detail and menace to find what she's looking for. Her character has heart and soul and responds vigilantly. I am happy finally to see a woman take the reins. Gina Carano GO!The plot however is too thick perhaps to understand and one gets greatly lost yet the determination of Gina Carano's character (Ava) removes doubt that this film might fall over. Only the bad guys drop dead!",positive
Kidnap,"I normally wouldn't write a spoiler for a review, but I find it necessary to pick this movie apart piece by piece 'cos the story was a load of Bull. First of all, I'm not sure which pisses me off more, the script writer that left so many holes in the story or the main character which Halle Berry played quite well. Suffice to say, while I find Halle's acting to be believable, I find the personality of the character she played quite confusing and unappealing. I really couldn't help disliking her and her choices from the beginning of the movie till the very end. I thought, ""well, how stupid can she get"" every five minutes. And here is why.1. Why didn't she slam into the kidnappers' car when she had the chance at the stop light? I would think adrenaline was pumping at that moment the incidence just occurred and some more desperate howbeit reckless attempt would have been made to recover the boy.2. It took her so long to get on the phone and call the cops while chasing the car that had her son. Really?! And don't tell us she lost her phone. All you need to do to attract the police in all 50 states is to rear end or side swipe a few cars and keep going. They will do the calling for you. She didn't as much as bash any other vehicle during the first half of the ""desperate"" chase.3. She was driving like my granny. 4. The scene where a cop on a motorcycle attempted to pull her over was just so silly. All she had to was keep going when the cop asked her to pull over till he called it in and had other cops on the chase. well, another scene that made this character seem like an idiot.5. So she offered up her financial instruments and didn't think to keep the pin as bargaining chip till she was at the point of ensuring an exchange then went ahead to let the kidnapper into her car... Not beside her, behind her. Then drove to a secluded highway. Why on earth would the kidnapper that has your son, your cards, your pin, keep you alive when the only thing keeping you from reporting the cards stolen is being alive? Is this character just daft or these is how people actually react when they are in crisis?6. She overpowers and throws out a woman twice her size, positioned behind her while she is driving and being strangled at the same time out of a moving mini-van. All the while with door closed. The only script allowed to have that sort of impractical scenario is a James Bond movie. Absolutely unbelievable. The woman also came into her vehicle with no phones on her with which to alert her ""boyfriend"" when she was tossed from the car?7. She actually stopped a stranger from getting run over by putting her vehicle between said stranger and a car about to run him over at a time she had the option of intercepting the kidnapper about to get away with her son. I believe natural instinct is self preservation before all else except a person has specific training to react otherwise in those circumstances. When i saw this scene, it didn't make her out to be a hero to me, I just felt she must not be trying to save her son.8. It took her almost an hour into the movie after driving Miss Daisy behind the kidnappers for her to realize she could rear end the car... guess what? Right about the time the car was running empty on gas. *roll my eyes*9. The kidnappers were painted not as newbies, but repeat offenders who did this for a living. Well, it didn't look like it. If they were pros, they had every opportunity to take the boy across state lines while the mum was taking a ""cruise"" around town.10. Then there is the question of how the boy made it from the car with the male kidnapper to the house where the kids were being kept. One moment, the boy is in the car with the male kidnapper being chased by the mum in distress, the next moment, the mum is asking ""where is my son?"" and she's fishing for an ID on the kidnapper's lifeless body. #Sheish!11. Kidnappers' Den. She sees a sawn off shotgun lying on a table and she leaves it. Really?! She's anti-gun? 12. The boat ploy was also dumb. If she could fool the woman, she couldn't fool a dog for a second. The dog would have gone for the water immediately and started barking not after she had fired off a few rounds into an empty boat which un-propelled was able to move away from a powerful flashlight that fast? Errmmm! Really?So I guess the only thing you could consider smart about the main character was the fact that she was able to pick up on the ""neighbour's"" lie? Psssssh! The main character was not properly developed and profiled. First acting conservative and unsure of what to do then later switching to aggressive, alpha personality. Every other thing that occurred in this plot was pure luck and stupidity on the kidnappers part. Well, I didn't see any well calculated attempt at recovering the child. The script is weak and empty. So thumbs down. I lost empathy for her and felt like smacking a head all though the movie maybe to knock a little sense into her. She should be loosing custody after this episode.",negative
Kidnap,"I've never yelled at a movie more than this. I literally made an account to tell anyone how bad this film is. No one acts like this if their kid is taken, she doesn't hit the car, she doesn't hit the people that took her kid. She had multiple chances to do so. Whoever wrote this script and directed this movie should never be able to work on a set ever again.",positive
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I was skeptical of this movie, to say the least. As a huge fan of both animes and the original manga, I doubted that Fumihiko Sori and his crew could do Hiromu Arakawa's masterpiece any kind of justice.However, the end result is surprisingly okay. Sure, the CGI tends to be an eyesore, the acting is all over the place, and some characters aren't remotely similar to their badass manga/anime counterparts (here's lookin' at you, Riza). But on the whole, this film kind of works. The screenwriters made good choices in terms of what to adapt and how to fit it all together, and some characters (mainly Hughes, portrayed by Ryuta Sato) work really well.Most importantly, the film has heart. I get the feeling that Fumihiko Sori and c:o genuinely cared about the adaptation, and that ain't nothin'. It's an ambitious production, though arguably an overly ambitious one.FAR from a perfect adaptation, and nowhere near as good as the animes or manga, but it's not an insult to the original story, and not a bad way to spend two hours of your life.",negative
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I'm going to try to keep my review as simple as I can, but I have been a huge fan of the FMA manga/anime for years so that might be a little tough. Casting: 10/10 (I really could not imagine anyone else playing any of the characters.)Acting: 10/10 (Amazing. just great. The way they worked so hard and brought the characters to life was just beautiful)CGI: 9/10 (It's not that it was bad, but I liked some of the CG better than other parts. Like the fire and Al was my absolute favorite! And the way everyone interacts with the CG is amazing)Story Flow: 8/10 (I agree with most, there was a few parts that were a little slow/a little fast but overall it was a great story. I especially really enjoyed the 1st half and most of the 2nd)Costuming: 12/10 (don't even get me started. They did perfect my dudes. Ed's coat was epic and the blue uniform were just the best)Dialogue: 10/10 (The fact that most of the dialogue was word for word from the original content brought me to tears)Music: 9.5/10 (There is actually only one place that I noticed that I didn't like the music. Actually, it was that there was no music that bothered me, and it was only like 3 seconds long. Yeah maybe I'm being picky, but to me music is very important, and so I couldn't help but be pulled out of the flow a little in one scene. besides that, they were totally spot on)Accuracy to the Original: 9/10 (True, they don't stick to the timeline very well, but 90% of the content in the movie has happened at some point in the series, so I can't give them any less than 9/10)Over all I'm going to give it a 10/10. mainly because I have never seen an anime to live action adaptation do as absolute wonderful as they did with this movie. Now, there will be people who don't like it, and that's fine. It does have a specific taste and feel that not everyone will like. I will say, if you go into this movie expecting it to be a recreation of the original manga/anime then you will probably be a little disappointed. But if you go into it understanding that they had to create a story that fits into 2 hours, not knowing if there was going to be a 2nd movie, and understand that it is an adaptation not a recreation, then I think you will be pleasantly surprised!",positive
The Grandmaster,"Sadly speaking, ""The Grandmaster"" does not get a grand score from me.Before this film, 3 movies have been made about Ip Man, with the first two by Donnie Yen. Like it or not, first movers always have an advantage. The prequel of Ip Man - ""A Legeng is Born - Ip Man"" - did pretty well, featuring a Wing Chun practitioner Dennis To. But, in my opinion, all these 3 movies did not sufficiently capture aspects of the Man's life stories that many fans are looking for - his philosophy about Wing Chun, how he took up Wing Chun, and, of course, his mentor-ship of Bruce Lee.""The Grandmaster"", in my opinion, missed this golden opportunity to satisfy the thirst of martial arts fans on these aspects.For one, I am surprised to see that the script chose to focus on something other than Wing Chun - the so-called ""64 forms"", a kind of martial art - and revolve around the relationship between Man and Gong Er (Zhang Ziyi), with a rather strange majority of screen time placed on Er. In fact, I strongly suspected that the ""Grandmaster"" in the film is actually Gong Er and not Ip Man (and perhaps this film will be so successful in this respect that there will be another film on Gong Er?)I believe audeince is in for the story behind Ip Man, Wing Chun and Bruce Lee, not ""64 forms"" or the fictitious Gong Er. It is clearly focus misplaced.The fighting sequence is a major disappointment as well. Fighting sequence is barely 5 moves in total, with the camera zooming in on to the hands or legs and, which is my pet peeve, the overuse of slow motion and special effects that obscure the real beauty of the moves. I am not sure whether these effects are specially chosen to mask the fact that Tony Leung is not a martial artist, but applying these on veterans such as Zhang Ziyi - who has learn some martial arts before - is a waste of talents.Taking a step back, I suspect that the producers and director seemed to want to break away from the proved formula of story-telling about Ip Man and Wing Chun, and took risk in the script and even cinematography. However, I see traces of Zhang Yimou in the technique, which I neither am opposed to nor strongly encouraged. However, I think the director OVERDID on the special and visual effects, because, in my opinion, he may have wanted every scene and frame to be visually stunning. While there are many scenes (including the special effects) that are indeed very captivating - e.g. those at the train station involving the duel of Gong Er and San - these effects quickly became a major muddling distraction for me, to an extent that I felt like the film has overrun in length in its appeal to audience.I prefer a film that takes care of its basics well, before venturing into the visual/special effects (what I consider icing on the cake). In any story involving Ip Man, the basics should be the man, his family, his time and his Wing Chun.Finally, the film applied another technique often seen in Zhang Yimou's films - the somewhat emotionally derived script with somewhat wooden expressions on its casts, with a hope to create an ambiance of mystery and helplessness (e.g. in a time that saw China fell into the hands of the Japanese during World War II). Personally, this technique is a waste of the acting talents of the likes of Tony Leung and Zhang Ziyi.""The Grandmaster"" is clearly a focus misplaced.I had higher hopes for anything Ip Man and Wing Chun.",negative
The Grandmaster,"THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE INTERNATIONAL CUT, NOT THE 'HARVEY WEINSTEIN' American VERSION:It was finally time for the great iconoclastic Hong Kong director to turn to martial arts in his intense and atmospheric telling of the great grandmaster teacher, Ip man, and he doesn't disappoint.Wong Kar-wai brings the poetic beauty of his ""In the Mood for Love"" to this Chinese action genre and executes it with a precise rhythmic heightening reminiscent of Sam Peckinpah at his best, while bringing out the experience of living through the Japanese invasion of China during WWII.The cast is magnificent, especially Tony Leung as the Ip man and Ziyi Zhang as Gong Er who perfectly embodies a kung-fu mistress trying to avenge her father.A Wong masterpiece to put on a level with his finest work!PS: One particular reviewer earlier criticized the editing of this film which, to me, smacks of putting down the film for not being more conventional. Sometimes it is difficult to put aside expectations of what one wants a film to be in favor of what the actual film on the screen is. ""The Grandmaster"" is, in fact, brilliantly edited. Wong is, if nothing else, a perfectionist in taking years to mold his assembled footage into his own personal rhythmic poem, idiosyncratically emphasizing downbeats and rests as precise as a great composer. What you see here is Wong Kar-wai's personal vision, take it or leave it. I wouldn't change a frame, or a single edit. It strikes me as a perfect diamond by this exceptional, if eccentric, cinema artist.",positive
The Villainess,"Korean cinema has been the most cutting edge and exciting exponent of action thrillers tinged with horror for the past 15 years or so, and I'm a big fan. You have to look far and wide for a very long time to find movies as deliriously twisted yet compelling as 'I Saw The Devil', 'Oldboy' or 'The Chaser'.So I was very disappointed to find a film that sounds as good on paper as 'The Villainess' turn out to be such a hectic, empty mess. The script is just plain awful, with every single character behaving in ways that make no sense and changing wildly in nature and motivation from one scene to the next. Characters appear, fall in love, get married and burst into flames in what seems like seconds, so there's barely enough time to remember if the person on the screen dying is the same person that had a line a few scenes back, let alone be deeply moved, which would seem to be the intended goal.The 'villainess' herself is just a bland, confusing and completely unbelievable maelstrom of stony-faced killer and fragile weeping rose, and the fact that she is played by two different actresses makes the whole thing even more bewildering and hard to keep track of than it would have been anyway. No explanation is given for the title of the movie, or, for that matter, anything she does.I will grant you the 'Hardcore Henry'-like opening scene is *technically* impressive, but as meaningful and involving as looking up from your phone to watch someone else play a first person shooter video game for a few minutes. There's no context to the violence, or real-world believability, so it's basically just a bunch of paper targets shaped like people falling over. There are a couple of other action set pieces that are advanced enough to make you wonder how they were done, but not enough to make you care why anyone was doing it, or what the outcome would end up being.By the end I was simply laughing at the deaths of characters I was apparently supposed to be heartbroken over, simply because so little effort had been put into making one care for them.I don't know who the hell signed off on this, who let a script so bloated with flaws through the net, but it really worries me to think they thought the bar in cinema was so low right now that no-one would notice. Anyway, 'The Villainess' is the most boring film I've sat through in years.",negative
The Villainess,"This film exceeded my expectations. The cinematography in a couple of the scenes is truly incredible, particularly the fight scenes that are one continuous shot. The fight choreography is top notch and neither overly stylized nor formulaic; most had me on the edge of my seat. The lead is an incredible actor, whose performance conveys all the depth the character needs to ground the film.",positive
Empire State,"Empire State is a very bad movie because it is based on a super weak unrealistic script. It may have roots in a true event but so much changed that it has become the biggest travesty.If you can temporarily completely suspend your disbelief and lower you IQ to 40 or less then maybe you can enjoy it, otherwise the probability is you'll ask yourself if the screenwriter is openly making fun of the audience or God forbid if he is completely retarded.Tens of millions of dollars (probably hundreds of millions of today's money) are kept in an unsecured warehouse guarded by a single untrained unchecked guard.Chris potamitis steals money but apparently money in the warehouse is never checked. Then he goes on a shopping spree with his totally idiotic retarded brother Eddie in a hip club in town, people are wondering how in hell he's got so much money to spend, Eddie clearly says in front of 3 girls that his brother stole the money where he works but of course everybody get away with this.His brother is obviously so retarded that any sane person would never ever have talked about a robbery plan with him.A highly unrealistic robbing takes place at exactly the same day and time as planned by the 2 brothers: what are the odds? Assuming this was possible one can only assume that the robbery was prepared with internal help. The cops have to assume it. The brothers have to assume it. The company has to assume it and all should change their plans accordingly.But nope, the depository does not seem to think it has to increase the guard count and take additional measures even temporarily.Main cop Ransome notices main character when his partner dies. Then during the failed robbery attempt by strangers he sees Chris Potamitis calling someone on the phone but there are no reasons to become highly suspicious right? - Shortly after that the alarm rings again during Chris' watch, and of course nobody is concerned that it is the second time in a row that the alarm rings during Chris watch, that it also was during his watch that a robbery attempt took place and that his partner was shot while touring with Chris. Frankly it is really strange that Chris hasn't been name president & CEO yet.9 million dollars are taken, there is a huge hole in the ceiling, the robber had to have the code or someone knowing the code had to open the door but no problem, Chris can go home and doesn't spend a second at a precinct.It's the biggest heist in US history but apparently it's not enough to check employee cars trunks. Also, only a genius would hide the money in the trunk of his brother's car trunk right? Because he knows for certain that the least suspicious robbers are employees right? - The cop is in his car, watching the 2 brothers arguing about what is in the car's trunk. He was suspicious enough to follow them but he isn't suspicious enough to run & go see what's in the trunk and confront them.You are a drug dealer. You hear about the heist of the century for 8 million dollars. A few days' later 2 low life losers come and want to purchase for 8 million of drugs. Are you A. suspicious or B. so happy you just go the biggest order in the history of drug dealing? Are you A. Taking the money and congratulating yourself or B. Try to rob they guys that got you 8 mil? - You just did the heist of the century. You A. Keep incriminating drawings in your locker for the fun of it or B. try to be as discreet as possible? - You just did the heist of the century. You A. lay low for a few years or B. think you will be the next big thing in drug dealing and buy drugs? - I could go on and on but you get the drill. Too bad there are decent actors there. If you want to see a decent movie about a true heist go see 11.6. -",negative
Empire State,"The movie was GREAT. I wasn't entirely sure about Liam Hemsworth playing a Greek character, but boy did he do a good job. Likewise with the guy who played Eddie, Michael Angarano,who I thought at first would have been better if Jerry Ferrara, Jimmy, had played him instead. Casting turned out well though and was pretty well thought out. Acting was, for the most part, spot on. The Rock is still the same 'rock' in terms of acting though. Everything about the movie was great, the gun scenes and the way the heist was pulled off. At times it's very predictable like the Col***** dr** de** scene. I thought it was also pretty smart to start the film at the end,and then work their way from the start. I've got no idea why IMDb has this rated as a 4.5* film, deserves at least a 7.5 or 8.Overall, a great film, easily re-watchable several times.",positive

Shin Godzilla,"The movie was a great satire on the Japanese Government during the time of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. The reactions by the Prime Minister, defense minister, etc etc during Godzilla's initial appearance perfectly recreate the indecision that lead to more people being killed in that country than necessary during the real life disaster. In short, this movie uses Godzilla to satirize the Japanese government. A new, more decisive body of government forms in the aftermath and one end of it wants to evacuate Tokyo to Nuke him and the other wants to make a more experimental approach by analyzing Godzilla's body chemistry (the science is actually pretty good and leads to a surprisingly tense climax that involves construction cranes pumping hoses down Godzillas throat). The scenes with the humans are also shot in a very dynamic and fast paced way. Characterization suffers (Japanese films do this thing where they just add an odd quirk to a characters personality and call it a day) but its all for the purpose on finding out how to take care of the giant monster rampaging through the city while minimizing human casualties. Believably too, like how the government would actually react would it have happened.As for the big guy himself, Toho definitely plays around with him a lot. He's still a big green iconic monster, but they change his design more than I've ever seen before. When he first appears in the movie, he's more like a tadpole and over the film evolves into the monster we know. But even then he does things like opens his lower jaw when breathing fire like the predator, shooting beams from his dorsal fin and tail, and there's even a VERY chilling shot at the end involving Godzillas tail with some imagery with broader implications on what Godzilla is able to do. But for all these new things that happen, there's a bunch of stylistic choices that keep it rooted in its history. There's music being used from the original 50's score than ever before (they use more than just that classic brass theme), Godzilla still has his trademark roar, and when he breathes fire in a way we've never seen before (it starts as gas, lights up into a jetstream of flame, and then concentrates into a beam) there's a classic sound effect played that we haven't heard in ages. In short, there's a bunch of new and classic stylistic choices in equal measure. Plus the scene where he destroys Tokyo is, in a weird way, gorgeous to look at.In short, this is the smartest giant monster movie I've ever seen. It's not for everybody but it's certainly for people who understand what that means.",negative
Shin Godzilla,"The film takes a somber, serious tone as to what would happen if Japan were attacked -- in this case, by a seemingly unstoppable foe. At present in Japan, there is an ongoing debate as to whether or not Japan should amend it's constitution to allow for an offensive military and this Godzilla film plays to exactly how powerless Japan would be in making it's own decisions during an attack of any kind. The reality is that the Japanese Prime Minister would have to ask for permission from the United States President before making an offensive move against a foreign threat and this film plays to that hard reality. This new Godzilla starts out as an homage to its former man in a monster suit so that when you first see Godzilla, you'll disbelieve what you're seeing, but this Godzilla evolves into something majestic and utterly awe inspiring in its power. What's more, this film makes it clear people die. In the Japanese release there's a lot of word play about how the government officials up high (on the fifth floor) make decisions that get passed down to people on lower floors that eventually hurt the people. I'm not sure how much will be translated, but the film is deliberately showing the disconnect between the political and day to day realities. Overall, the performances are good. There is one character who they, for whatever reason, decided to make speak English in odd an inappropriate times. This isn't a film for US audiences. The aesthetics will turn off a lot of non-Japanese young people accustomed to CG reality. But if you're open to learning about another culture, this is an excellent film, one of the best kaiju-films you'll ever see.",positive
First Kill,"Absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Can't believe Bruce Willis is in it, and even his acting is horrible. The Dad character is just a punk kid trying to say all of the right things to his son who's acting ability is just as bad as everyone else.s. The Mom character couldn't get an audition in a middle school play. To top it all off is the never ceasing awful music that is constantly playing in the background. Could not watch the whole thing. I just walked out.",negative
First Kill,"It's not so much an edge-of-the-seat movie as the main actors have been in. It's entertaining. Gave it a 10 because it's under-rated by so many reviewers who certainly had other agendas dominating their skewed viewpoints to have written such negative reviews. Would have given it a 7 or 8, otherwise.",positive
A Prayer Before Dawn,"Great cinematography. Realistic prison drama. Fighting sequences OK.
Background story non-existent, IMO main character or story not interesting and you dont get to know the main protagonist at all, viewer is left to his own conclusions.
Lots of loose ends, no development between characters, despite years of incarceration in small quarters together, random shallow conversations.
Title of movie is meaningless in context of pictured events, simply a made up ""catchy"" title.
Story premise, ""fighting for his freedom"", is false. 
Freedom from prison by fighting not a possibility in story, gets easy treatment and transfer/short sentence for being ""farang""/western. 
Freedom from drugs not shown in any way as a goal for the character.
Fighting for his life by being transferred to ""softer"" accommodations away from the gangs could be a purpose, but not sufficiently shown in movie and is attacked by gang anyway after transfer. 
Dads appearance seems made up and only put in to give the real Billy Moore a cameo. 
All in all great cinematography, shot in a style that gives you the feeling of being there, story is rubbish - waste of time.",negative
A Prayer Before Dawn,"A Prayer Before Dawn touches upon almost every grand subject of life. Love, lust, hate, deep anxiety and the willingness to survive.

This film was a proper hit to the gut. Punt intended. Bravo.",positive
The Man with the Iron Heart,"Good intentions. and a reasonable result. admirable job from Rosamunde Pike and Jason Clarke. and something missing. petr-varak review defines the basic problem - HHhH is a movie containing more two films more than two parts. the biography of Heydrich remains a sketch , correct but superficial, reminding a resume. and the second part seems be remind of ~Antropoid~, not a bad fact, useful to remind the events from Prague of 1943. but , having the same pieces and the same story and tools , it is difficult to ignore the similitudes, more inspired presented in the first film. remembering a docu-drama, it has the gift to be good start point for discover the life and the work of Reinhard Heydrich.",negative
The Man with the Iron Heart,"This film may not be perfect but its a solid effort and certainly of interest to those who have studied this period in history and the major players that shaped events as it were. Reinhard Heydrich was just such an individual and what this film does, where 'ANTHROPOID' among others failed, was to show Heydrich beyond just the heroism of the Czech resistance fighters who plotted to kill him for justifiable reasons. Heydrich was never really a political animal nor did he have any interest in the Nazis until his wife came along and convinced him to join. Had he not been cashiered from the Navy its quite likely history would've been written very differently and this movie shows us how these minor events led to the creation of a monster. My only complaint would be that it didn't tell us much about Heydrich's views towards Jews and his role in crafting the Final Solution, but other films like HBOs 'CONSPIRACY' will go along way towards shedding light on that question for interested viewers. The film's inherent weakness is trying to condense over 20 years of Heydrich's life into two hours while also explaining the plot that led to his assassination. That may have been a tall order for any director but at the same time this isn't a film meant for mass consumption. It's not a date movie nor a family affair but is only of interest to those who enjoy history. If you find the topic boring you'll undoubtedly give the movie a low rating but I think as far as this genre is concerned 'THE MAN WITH THE IRON HEART' is certainly a respectable entry in telling the story of one of history's greatest villains.",positive
Jeepers Creepers III,"What were they doing in those 14 years between 2 and 3, staring at their shoelaces? I love the first two films because they are both scary and well made, but WOW, this film is GARBAGE. TRUST ME, this is coming from a HUGE JC fan! The film takes place between the 1st and 2nd movie, which is dumb because nobody wanted to see what happened between the 1st and 2nd movie. I wanted to see what happened after the 2nd movie, but even then, it's really confusing because the plot keeps jumping back and forth between all of these dumb characters. I couldn't tell if the film was set in the present day, in 2001, or in the 70's because of the craptastic pacing. There's even a scene where you can see a 2016 Chevy truck in a film that supposedly takes place in 2001. Speaking of pacing, there is none! Nothing happens in this movie and the film ends right when it should've started! There are so many characters that the film gets lost in itself. The first film had Darry and Trish, simple and easy. The 2nd film had the athletes and a side-plot revolving around an angry father, but it was still easy to follow and well balanced. Here, we have an old lady getting visions from her dead son, then we have Sargeant Tubbs from the first movie, then we have the anti-Creeper gang, then we have some teenagers, then we have a country boy who has a crush on a girl, and said girl also gets her own storyline. All the characters are pointless and are not flushed out because the film is trying so hard to give equal focus to everyone. The CGI is SO BAD and is EVERYWHERE in the film. It's so bad that my theater was laughing louder than the actual movie! The Creeper doesn't do ANYTHING, no smelling fear, eating body parts, he just sorta walks around and grunts. There's one good scene where a group of teenage bikers finds The Creepers truck in the woods, and it's the only good scene in the entire film. That's it! Worst of all, WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE CREEPERS'S ORIGINS!!! I've been waiting nearly 2 decades and we STILL DON'T KNOW WHERE HE COMES FROM??? The film ends on a cliffhanger but I do not want a 4th movie. This feels like it should've been made for the SyFy channel and seeing this on the big screen is like seeing Lake Placid 6 on the big screen. Just don't do it!",negative
Jeepers Creepers III,"Jeepers Creepers 3 is a weird movie going experience. I loved the first one, and really liked the second one. I went into three wanting to love it. I didn't. But here is the weird part. The movie felt like it was never fully finished. Almost like a very rough first draft was the finished product. It almost looked as if they ran out of money before it was completed. It was very strange. If you are a fan of the first two, you will like to see the characters you love. If this is your first experience with the characters, you will be like what the hell did I just watch!",positive
Angry Birds,"You know what? I went with my kids thinking I will get bored because the movie was rated around 6/10. I actually had more fun than the kids.I've watched the movie in 2D. The characters are rather 'mature' and some dialogues will appeal more to adults than to kids. It is not a 'childish' movie.The battle scene is wayyy noisy, long (it lasts about 20 minutes) and overwhelming, I noticed several young kids in the theater lost patience and quit standing seat and were getting agitated.Other than that, the birds are nice looking. I had no idea what this movie will be about as I'm not a big game player, but the story kinda keeps up well enough and the movie is 'dynamic' at most moments.",negative
Angry Birds,"The movie takes place on Bird Island, an untouched paradise inhabited by birds who are naive and innocent. These good birds know nothing of the outside world. They treasure eggs above all else, and are all carefree and easygoing, except for few. One of these birds is Red, a societal outcast who has had anger issues from the very beginning. Eventually, his outbursts become too much and he is sentenced to anger management courses, where he meets other misfit birds with similar problems.The birds are suddenly visited by green pigs, who are dumb but funny. The birds and pigs quickly befriend each other, but Red does not trust the pigs at all. Ultimately, the pigs reveal their true colors, and leads to Red leading the entire flock in a ""maddening"" frenzy of rightful revenge as well as finding the right means of dealing with rage.Everything about this movie is impressive . I can guarantee you this great movie will make you happy.",positive
Ben-Hur,"Where do I begin with such a deplorable movie? Let's start with cinematography. The vast majority of the scenes are filmed in a frustrating haze of darkness; the excessive use of close-ups is nauseating; and, worst of all, the camera is constantly jerking throughout the film, which left me with a splitting headache when I left the theater.When compared with the classic 1959 version, the 2016 story is as humorously silly as it is shamefully insulting. Here's just a few examples: In the chariot race, our hero falls out of his chariot; manages, somehow, to hold on to the reins; is dragged for an entire lap around the arena; finds the incredible strength to pull himself up back into the chariot; and, most astounding, not a scratch is on him. Oh, by the way, Ben-Hur's chariot breaks up at the end, permitting him to have a climatic finish, literally rolling across the finish line.Then, there is Ben-Hur's mother and sister, who are miraculously cured of leprosy, but they do not have a clue as to whom they owe this miracle. They are totally unsympathetic characters - as, in fact, all of them are.The adoption of Ben-Hur by Roman Counsel Quintus Arius, which is crucial for setting the dramatic scene of Ben-Hur's return to Jerusalem from the galleys, is totally missing. Instead, in this latest version, Ben-Hur is reduced to a fugitive slave, running from the Judean authorities like a scared rabbit.In the 1959 version, the evil Macella dies in the chariot race, but with his last breath informs a bewildered Ben-Hur - in a triumphant tone - that his mother and sister are lepers and that ""the race goes on."" Ben-Hur, naturally, is crushed by the news. In the 2016 version, in stark contrast, Macella lives (minus a leg); the two tearfully forgive each other; and, at very the end, they ride off on horses into the sunset like some Grade B western.Please. PLEASE! Watch the critically-acclaimed 1959 version and you will enjoy perhaps the greatest Hollywood film of all time. However, if you choose, like me, to go see this latest version out of curiosity, remember that you have been warned.",negative
Ben-Hur,"The classic 1959 Charlton Heston version is the one I and the rest of the baby boomers grew up on and it remains one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time. But I was very impressed by the 2016 remake. Gone is the stilted dialogue and ""holy look"" (as Victor Mature described it) of the old time biblical epics. The 2016 version has a bold take on the classic and a fresh approach to the story. It surpasses the 1959 version in originality, imagination, and devotion to detail. The Roman legion is shown in all its scope, strength, and ruthless brutality. The character of Jesus has a prominent role, whereas in the classic version, he never spoke nor did we see his face. With anti Christian sentiment on the rise in the entertainment industry, I wonder if the negative reviews written about this film reflect the agenda driven bias of the critics. The sea battle was spectacular and far surpassed the 1959 version. The epic chariot race was a wonderful homage to the Heston version, complete with the awe inspiring stadium built into living rock and with giant statues in the middle of the track. The race itself rivals the classic one in intensity and imagination. Terrific movie, great acting, and intense realism.",positive
I Am Wrath,"'I Am Wrath' is very moving film - it is not hard to move on after first fifteen minutes. I managed to sit through it somehow. It's almost like John Travolta wanted to make a lousy parody of Nicolas Cage. 'John Wick' made revenge movies look cool again, and 'I Am Wrath' really tries to emulate similar coolness but it falls out like toothless alligator trying to eat buffalo. Travolta and Christopher Meloni has good chemistry between them, but the script is too shallow that the actors don't have enough material to work on. It uses every, absolutely every known cliché to human kind, that all the twists of the film can be guessed at the opening credits even if you have turned off your brain almost comatose like state. No surprises, no style. Totally unnecessary movie.Oh yeah, John Travolta's hairpiece deserves it's own movie.",negative

Unlocked,"2 September 2017. This is one of those movies whose marketing team in their apparent zeal gave away too much in the trailer, disclosing a great twist occurring about 25 minutes into the movie. For those prospective audience members, it might be a good idea to avoid trailers and instead review some movie critic reviews or comments on IMDb which hopefully don't make the same mistake. Of incidental interest is the primary location of the film being Britain which currently in same year of this movie's American release (2017) has been a country that has been at the epicenter of some of the tense immigration issues facing the Western portion of the world today.Even with the opening credits, the movie begins with excellent sound and an energizing music track. The opening scenes have the same sharp, raw feel as Doug Linman's The Bourne Identity (2002). The initial chronological events are rather unclear unfortunately. Such a cute but mentally challenging beginning seems to detract from the main storyline, requiring the audience to use more of the brain just to determine what happened and what's going on when instead they could be experiencing the thrill and power of the actual story and reserve their brain power for a little further into the movie when the real mystery begins.The segue into the emerging actual crisis is well achieved and handled by John Malkovich bringing a refreshing, experienced, and distinctive personality to the role of CIA division chief. Michael Douglas gives his usual credible role as a former CIA boss though his acting doesn't really standout. The gun battles that occur are sparkling in their delivery and most stand out for their slightly different but intriguingly compelling script directions and performances from most espionage movies. Once the heart pounding suspense develops a fourth way into the movie, it continues as an uneasy and biting nagging but vital sensation for the audience member throughout the movie. The smooth and spot on editing, the use of the ominous music track are wonderfully woven into this movie enhancing the energy and urgency of each impending moment of each scene that explodes on the screen. Emotions are allowed to run wild both on and off the film while a trace of espionage rationality remains intact. Malkovich and Collette offer up some delightful entertaining administrative badgering for some respite to the theatrically-induced elevated heart beat and respiration rate. The director and screenwriter have even taken pains to allow the audience to gather some much needed composure with brief scenes of reflection between the fast-paced stylish physical battles.The enemy in this movie can be engaging, smart, calculating and oftentimes cold, impassioned, and precise - finally a worthy, competitive rival for the fate of thousands if not millions. At one point, the almost unseen enemy is almost irritatingly too capable but that is also what might be thought of as what's reflected in to today's much more diverse and volatile world where North Korea and Iran have grown stronger, the Chinese and Russia are advancing rapidly in their own ways. And what of America's own polarized society, what dangers lurk here? At the same time the principle lead, Noomi Replace as a CIA agent Alice Racine (made famous with her role in the original Scandinavian ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" trilogy) called back as a crucial interrogator is herself capable, astute, and deadly in both her escapes and her pursuit. Interestingly, Replace appears to have both some of the physical as well as performance features of a younger Toni Collette (an Academy Award nominated Australian actress) who also appears in this movie wearing a nice short white hair cut as a British MI-5 administrator. Later Orlando Bloom makes his debut into this movie which whether for good or bad bringing some of his mischievous Pirates of the Caribbean personality with him. What one might call a sexist weakness in this movie is one scene in which Replace appears to survive more by luck than by agility or guile. Whether or not this scene might be more reflective of the real world as supposedly all the near escapes in most spy movies are literally unlikely or consistently exaggerated. For Americans, good triumphs usually over evil in most physical confrontations particularly in later scenes. Nevertheless, the American fantasy and to pull for the masculine win (by it either by a man or woman super spy) over the bad people still seems to resonate when judging even this movie. In this case Replace comes out appearing weaker than her male counterparts in other spy movies or maybe it's the other movies that are the problem with deluding the audience that the protagonist somehow must win mostly all the time by his own wit and physical ability.What has been missing from many male dominated espionage movies is a serious female based on the same level of intelligent screen writing, action, and sophisticated plot. What a female presentation offers and which Replace is allowed some time to present is a more sensitive, tender, sympathetic emotional reveal that isn't syrupy or wimpy, but honestly felt emotions that are often covered up by the more Replace's masculine counterparts. Replace brings an important emotional heft and humanity to the role and to the movie (just picking up an infant in her arms is significantly different from other similar movies). Geena Davis gets to present a similar soft touch in her performance in the under-rated The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996) where she plays an actual mother with amnesia but who has a hidden more sinister mysterious past.It is fascinating that one of the themes of this movie is much more about peace than war than such a movie might suggest. In this movie as in the real world, the truth is much more complex less black and white. In such a fashion, this movie makes a powerful, contemporary statement in our present times of peril and hatred confronting our world today.",positive
Overdrive,"Do not waste your time with this movie. -Directing is bad: car chases are slow and the director does not give the audience a single frame that would surprise or be exiting to watch, a lot of editing mistakes, bad special effects (like the Porsche 911 that catches fire after a crash...). French companies were in charge of the special FX (umedia VFX and Digital District) and while they must have put a lot of effort to do their job with a budget...the result is laughable. -Acting is very bad: Scott Eastwood CAN NOT ACT. So does the rest of the crew... - Cars: We're talking about a car movie...and the cars were just ridiculous except for two... - Bad script: very predictable (if you didn't see the twist coming at the end...you're not very bright) - I would like to ask Mr. Scott Eastwood and the movie producers to refund my tickets for this movie!",negative

Attack on Titan Part 1,"A few minutes into the movie I was taken by surprise that the director chose to wildly mash up the characters and their relationships. Even though I really like the anime I was open to a new envisionment of the source material, since prejudice is something I try not to practice. Maybe the director wanted a new interpretation, while maintaining the essence of the series. But then it dawned on me that this new interpretation was leaky at best and the capturing of the essence was a parody. It was a 90 minute crap-fest of half-assed dialog, disinterested story telling and slasher-like violence. The movie also had a particular inability of finding a tone. Any tone. All the scenes feel staged, unreal and almost completely unrelated. Most disturbingly however was the implausibility. Nothing seems connected and nobody related. This is a waste of brilliant source material!",negative
Attack on Titan Part 1,"I had an amazing time at the Fantasia showing of this. The audience went wild. The visuals blew me away. If you like classic Godzilla, or better yet, any of the director's Gamera films, this is for you.Classic film effects ratcheted tension to the breaking point. The cheesy characterization was flawless and intentional. Superb experience on many levels. Also loud, but wonderfully loud.Remember the first tingling of fear when you saw Jurassic Park on the big screen? This is that good.If you are not comfortable with anime rules of exposition and emotional outpourings, you might find the human performances awkward, but the lean story moves things along and all the information you need to know about what kind of vividly portrayed vision of hell is going down is amply provided.This is a funhouse horror show.Most of us at the screening loved the melodrama. That's what sometimes works with giant monsters eating human beings and gobs of blood and flesh raining down and oozing out the windows.This movie is dark and grinds away into some truly discomforting terror moments, even as it careens around spiral roads of goofiness at dizzying speeds.If you liked the throwback elements of Fury Road, the classic effects techniques of this giant monster nightmare might appeal. Visually and sonically it was a huge thrill and totally unique. See it big.Does everything work? Who cares. I don't go to the circus for Shakespeare or some huge subtext feast on Netflix.I go to the circus to feel my heart pound as my head explodes.Thank you big screen for staying real.(PS. I think everything works, but I'm no pickier than I need to be to enjoy the ride, and this one's worth it.)",positive
The Lego Ninjago Movie,This movie does not follow the plot of the TV show at all. My son was bored out of his mind. There was very little humor and very little plot.

The wife, or I should say 'token pregnant wife' is there to give you some insight in the life of Vaucan but no matter how you try, you cannot connect to her plight. Only reason her being there is for the bad guys to take her hostage at the end and. The central story is the ripoff of Three Laws of Robotics, while the story revolves about robots being prohibited to modify themselves. And of course, they do modify themselves and evil company that built them tries to kill them and everyone who found this out. The movie tries to ask interesting questions about free will, but that in the end falls flat, because the main motive of the robots was finding a battery so they can build another robot (for what reasons, it is not explained, not is its shape) and escape into the nuclear wasteland.

Antonio Banderas gave one of the best performances i've seen recently in a sci-fi film and i hope he does more movies in this genre.In parts it reminded me of a cross between Blade Runner and District 9, but with an identity of it's own.

Too much emphasis is placed on the religious aspects of this story making it feel like a veritable propaganda flick, ruining all chances of immersing in the story-line.Do not waste your money on such a poorly produced movie. Religious or not, you will walk out of the theatre with nothing but regrets.",positive
Broken City,"To paraphrase Mayor Hostetler (Russell Crowe), there are some films you watch and some films you walk away from. This ain't the watching kind.Broken City is a forgettable film worth celebrating only because Russell Crowe, 'fresh' from Les Miserables, doesn't sing in it. It's not dreadful in a Movie 43 kind of way but don't confuse it with Broken, a vastly different and infinitely superior film.What's wrong with Broken City? It's dull. It plods along, reluctant to arrive and, when it does it, it looks and feels as though it should have done so thirty-odd years ago. Everything feels second hand and outdated. Russell Crowe sports a mullet only the cruelest of mothers would have inflicted on their child in the 70s, much of the incidental music could have been lifted and diluted from Stewart Copeland's score for The Equalizer and Catherine Zeta-Jones rehashes the same character she's played throughout her career.Unfortunately, we've come to expect ham from Crowe in recent years, but we expect more from Mark Wahlberg, the star power here. But he, too, has pulled an old character out of the wardrobe to dress himself in and it looks distinctly worn out since we saw it in Contraband.The dialogue is predictable, the plot even more so. Cop-turned private eye, Billy Taggart (Wahlberg) variously works for and crosses swords with the mayor, who just happens to be in an election campaign against Jack Valliant (Billy Pepper playing the supporting man with pained expression again) and is up to his neck in a dodgy deal worth millions to sell half the city. Taggart may not be whiter than snow (what cop is?), Mrs. Hosteleter (Zeta-Jones) is the bitch-vamp with attitude who despises her husband and Taggart's old boss, Fairbanks (Jeffery Wright), is probably up to at least his waist in something unpleasant.It started poorly but I hoped it might pick up. Unfortunately, screenwriter Brian Tucker (who, incidentally, has absolutely nothing else to his credit on IMDb! What does that say?) is unable to save it from drowning in its own juices. He shovels on information to helps us understand as though educating monkeys, but appears to have forgotten what he wrote on the previous pages. In one scene we watch an aide dump a rubbish bag filled with hush-hush city plans only for Taggart to find them; in the next we watch the same team hastily shredding evidence.There's probably some action and the odd smart quip, but to be honest I had more fun trying to plait my arm hair.I'd like to say my evening improved but I attempted to wash my brain out with a screening of Fire With Fire.Oh dear For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",negative
Broken City,"This movie is a ridiculous mess . The script was awful , made no sense , left plot lines hanging. Horrible waste of actors I like. That being said, only Crowe made an effort in this stupid movie and it wasn't very much of an effort . Walhberg is an alcoholic who stopped drinking 7 years ago , he breaks with his wife--with absolutely no groundwork laid for this breakup , they seemed very much in love until the breakup, and he just starts drinking. No one says anything about it , he handles the alcohol fine , and we never see the wife again and she doesn't seem to entire Walhberg's mind. It's so stupid that I can't even go into all the things that don't make any sense. Just save your money and see something else , this will just make you mad.",positive
Hot Pursuit,"It just seemed like everything was forced. The scenes, the acting. I can tell you, something just wasn't right about this movie, and this is coming from a big fan of chic flicks. They weren't funny at all (Reese Witherspoon and Sofía Vergara), they were actually annoying, using cheap gags that have been used a thousand times before. I really really really tried... but couldn't bring myself to see the film till the end.I've always loved these two actresses, so I don't know what happened in this one. Well my summary pretty sums it all up... it was a hot mess.",negative
Hot Pursuit,"Critics are those who will tell you, that the movie, that you are laughing your head off at, isn't funny. Critics must be serious. They have lost their sense of humor. Snooty people and critics study the development of film at the cinema. Real People watch movies.Hot Pursuit works much better than Heat. The only difference between Heat and any male buddy movie is the two female leads. The chemistry between Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vigera in Hot Pursuit works very well. Most of the gags are very funny. I would like to ask critics, if the movie wasn't funny, why was I laughing? Maybe the critics wasted too much time in film school and not mingling with real people.",positive
Shadow,"As ""Shadow"" (2018 release from China; 116 min.) opens, we are thrown in what seems like the middle of a story line. A kingdom's King and his Commander are arguing about the Commander's unauthorized challenge to a rival kingdom. The King is not pleased as this may undo the truce and alliance between the two kingdoms. But the real challenge is how to take back Jing City, held by yet another rival kingdom for the last 20 years. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil you viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest opus from Chinese writer-director Zhang Yimou, best known in the US for his masterful ""House of Flying Daggers"". Here he brings us a Chinese period piece with a Byzantine plot that I was able to follow only in the big picture. I am certain to have missed lots of nuances. But it really doesn't matter, because what we, or certainly I, came to this movie for are the carefully orchestrated, almost ballet-like, fight scenes, and on that level I was not disappointed. Both the one-on-one fights and the massive battle scenes are a thing of beauty. None is better than the invasion of Jing City in the movie's second half, as the battle takes place in the pouring rain. I don't really understand why the movie uses hardly any colors (it's not quite B&W but it's not far from it either), I imagine there is some artistic explanation for it.""Shadow"" premiered at last year's Venice film festival to good acclaim. Yes, almost a year ago. It is now playing a limited run (only 4 days) at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at was not attended well (exactly 6 people). That is a shame. If you are in the mood for another epic and Shakespeare-reminding film from China, I'd readily suggest you check out ""Shadow"", be it in the theater (if you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",negative
Shadow,"During the Three Kingdoms 1,650 years ago, deception was often employed to survive in the high courts of kings. The war commander of one nation is nothing more than a shadow. His twin brother, the real talent, bides his time in the underworld until he can stage a coup and take revenge upon the king. Yet decoys assume a life of their own, and the shadow twin may take the power and possessions of the one he serves, but only if he is willing to strike and at the right moment. A love interest could provide all the motivation he needs, or perhaps all the distraction to cause him to fail and to be recognized for who he is.There are many layers to this complex and resplendent film. Every frame is beautiful. Backgrounds are in bold black and white, with human figures providing the color. There is pulse quickening action, seductive romance, the eerily enchanting chords of the Chinese harp and ambient sound of rain and running water, wonderful dialogue, humor, history, yin and yang, intriguing stories, attractive people, fantastic acting and sword play, constant surprises, and more. Deng Shao plays both the shadow and the commander, and he does so brilliantly. North American premiere and the best film I saw at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival.",positive
The Darkest Minds,Personally I disagree with IMDB's low rating - I really enjoyed this film,negative
The Darkest Minds,"To be honest, I am not sure why lots of people dislike this film. However, I can personally say that I enjoyed this film immensely. Being a fan of the book series, I was already excited for the film's release, but was nervous about the YA novel adaptation. However, I feel that while the book and film are different in many ways (as they have to be, as there are things in the novel that can't be done easily on screen), the production team did a wonderful job of making the film their own, but sticking to the novel very well. Although it seemed fast paced at times, I was eager to see what would happen next. My mom, who has never read the series, left the theater and said ""well, now I'm going to have to steal the second book from you and read it, because I can't wait until another movie to see what happens!""
Please, do not listen to the negative reviews, and go see this film for yourself. I had the incredible opportunity to be a background extra on the set of the film, and saw firsthand how hard both the cast and crew worked to bring this film to life. Please go support to not only see an incredible storyline come to life, but to encourage future YA novel adaptations, female directors, and inclusive/diverse casting.",positive
Acts of Vengeance,"This truly is one very rubbish film, I was hoping it would get better as I watched it but it didn't, it was predictable and cheesy, another embarrassing movie on netflix",negative
Acts of Vengeance,"When you mix director/fight choreographer Isaac Florentine of the successful Undisputed & Ninja franchise films, with the amateur/novice writing of Kenpo Karate, Hapkido, Kyokushin, and Shen Chuan disciplined Matt Venne, and cast a non-martial artist well respected B-actor, you create a bad-ass film, starring of course Antonio BAnDerASS!Yes we've seen these type of films many times over, and going into this one I was prepared for disappointment, but I was wrong. I really did enjoy this film, especially due to the fact that this (bad-ass) role is not in the 57 years-old Antonio Banderas' wheelhouse - and he impressed!Now I know most wannabe critics are going to dissect this film and slam it with comparables, but let's look at the obvious here; we have an amateur writer who presented a decent piece. Yes, it could have been better and tighter, but it's amateur, and rating the writing as such, it's pretty decent. Now compare this low budget B-grade film to some of the big-budget Hollywood action flicks (John Wick being one of my all time favs), and it's been produced very well. Let's go one step further and compare it to actual martial arts films with real martial-artists such as Jean Claude van Damme and Steven Seagal (of which lately I cringe when I see any of their films); This films writing, directing, choreography AND acting blows all of those away. Sure the latter are not real actors, but martial- artists, and Banderas is an actor and not a martial artist, but he was more believable and entertaining in this film. Hat's off for his performance and I hope he does more action films like these.This is by no means a perfect film, and had the writing/screenplay been teamed up with a Hollywood pro, it would have had the makings of another John Wick franchise.Nevertheless, a very enjoyable film, and rating it on it's merits, I give it an 8.5/10 rounded up to a 9, as I know it will be slammed with undeserving ratings of 1's.I definitely recommend this film and hope they come out with a part 2. And if anyone is questioning my review as fake, click my username to see my almost 300 reviews and 700 ratings. Then go see this film!",positive
K.G.F: Chapter 1,"What's Passion? To work or put efforts on something repeatedly until you get it absolutely right, which one loves and holds close to the heart without getting distracted even for a second. In one of the interviews Prashant Neel, the Director had said that he has watched KGF more than 150 times while editing. He wanted to make his KGF, a near perfect craft. While shooting, Bhuvan Gowda, the cinematographer used to carry around 40kgs of the camera and its accessories on top while canning the sequences in windy and dusty region. The gigantic sets used to come down crashing after heavy wind and rains yet the Art Director, Shivakumar used to go back in erecting the same sets as they stood earlier. Yash, used to give multiple retakes with no sign of fatigue or feeling bored in that dust bowl.KGF will be made in two chapters. The chapter 1 is out and at the outset, it traces with pre-historical chronology world of events letting the audience know the importance of owning Gold and the battles for it. The chapter 1 deals with micro level of unorganized crime, Mafia and underworld. The Chapter 1 depicts about the greed and the race for one-up man-ship within many characters in getting the control of Goldmine, KGF. To enter into the Macro level of an orbit of world crime syndicate, one has to clear his way at the micro level. The dirt has to be cleaned to make way to the top. The chapter 1 ends at the doorstep of Chapter 2, which is meant to open for the Triangular battle between International mafia (for Gold), The interruption of India's Govt and Rocky (who valorously emerges out of KGF slavery, as a Messiah)The film is narrated through the author's (Played by Anantnag) First hand experience to a News Editor (Played by Malvika Avinash) As his book gets banned by the Central Govt. He traces the journey of rocky from his birth to establishing himself as the feared crime lord from Mumbai docks to Bangalore to finally his destined place KGF. The mother sentiment is well crafted and placed appropriately throughout the film. Though the story line is predictable and replicates Ugramm template. In KGF also just like Ugramm, many characters get introduced and thus challenges one's memory to remember the count of characters. Yash's introduction in an elaborated action sequence keeps everyone engaged and makes glued to the screen. KGF falters at few places in the first half. Yash-Srinidhi scenes could have been better. The army of supporting characters may be revealed more in the Chapter 2. It's the second half, which meets the expectation and ends with retaliating climax, leaving multiple threads open only to be tied later in Chapter 2 on another day.KGF, from start to finish, is full of high octane action sequences, The dialogues are sharp and effective, Music is average, but gets compensated through an outrageous BGM (some influence from the soundtrack of Hams Zimmer's ""The Oil""(Dunkirk).On Technical front: The captain of KGF mines, Prashant Neel, the Director should take a bow for bringing his vision on screen. Editing is very sharp, multiple scenes are played parallel and also intellectually blurred at few places to showcase that the character had no idea about the things to come. Ravi Basrur's music is a downer, but his BGM raises the milieu in all the sequences. The cinematography by Bhuvan Gowda is top-notch and world class (he will get all the awards if nominated functions PAN India level in 2019). The never say die attitude of Art Director Shivakumar should get all the accolades for erecting such massive sets of mines, in the midst of the dust bowls. KGF has used 90% of sets and just 10% of VFX for filming. KGF- Chapter 1 sets the stage for a macro-level showdown in chapter 2.",negative
K.G.F: Chapter 1,"With beautiful Background score, Cinematography, Action and direction, the movie is a treat for Mass fans across India with heavy power packed dialogues filled with all sorts of emotions. What seems like a Rocky's celebration has layers when looked closely. There are characters who want Rocky to win in the end and have made him easier to do do, That certainly gives an idea of how the past and uture story unveils in KGF Chapter 2. Enjoyed the movie with all heart :). Good luck and love to team KGF!",positive
Kill Me Three Times,"No, really. Simon Pegg as a hit-man - Charles Wolfe. It's kind of a light Aussie-American Tarantino film mash up. Think Reservoir Dogs meets Hot Fuzz, but not really. Other reviews are so-so, me personally? I dug it. I was tinkering with some PC's with this on in the background and then it turned into me watching this and occasionally playing with the PCs. Not bad. It has a slightly over saturated visual style mainly in all the outside establishing shots. The soundtrack wasn't intrusive nor very memorable. If you watch the first seven minutes or so, you pretty much have the tone of the film. There's some good surprises and decent black humor. Not sure if we'll see a John Wick/Charlie Wolfe team-up anytime soon - but that would be awesome. It's good to see Bryan Brown in a movie, it's been a while since I've seen him.",negative
Kill Me Three Times,"First off, there are violent deaths in the movie. There is a lot of graphic violence, but it isn't overdone for the style of movie it is. When we see someone try to shoot for their head and miss, instead hitting the neck, it shows it as an example. The beautiful thing about this action comedy is that it takes influences from Quentin Tarantino and cult classics such as Ravenous when it comes to the brutality of the action. However, there are no torture scenes for the sake of torture. While the brutal action is not for some, it is equal in the level of gore to movies such as the Die Hard series or Lethal Weapon series. The movie is able to keep more of a comedic pace due to not having excess torture and alike scenes. But for us action fans, it doesn't shy away from the reality of getting shot.I see this movie being reflected on more positively over the years. Its a movie that for the right person can be watched multiple times. I plan to re-watch it at least a few times myself.People who would not like this but expect to would be people who didn't like Simon Pegg's earlier films such as Hot Fuzz. I enjoyed that myself, but a lot of people didn't.The action is spread out among comedic moments that also take influence from movies such as Snatch. The movie, titled Kill Me Three Times, is not expected to be a movie where characters really die at a realistic pace. Its basically implying that someone in the movie (no spoilers) or some people in the movie just won't die despite realistically being killed off already. I'm refusing to say which character(s) because this keeps my review spoiler-less.For fans of this type of action comedy, it is a 9/10. For the market that Kill Me Three Times tailors to, it couldn't have done a better job. That's why I am giving this movie a 9/10. Though it can't be expected to win Academy Awards, its an excellent b action/crime/comedy. I enjoyed it the first time around more than I enjoyed the first Fast and Furious at release.I appreciate that its obvious that the cast had a lot of fun making this movie, while not failing to submerse the viewer in an enjoyable theatrical performance.For those who would enjoy this style of film, you'll probably watch it a few times at the very least. While this movie may not be for loyal action movie fans, it is not intended to please everyone.Enjoy if you can handle brutal action and have a dark sense of humor.",positive
Into the Storm,"It is uncomfortable to say, because I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, but this is a really awful movie. First, the trailers were very misleading. This flick is a limp 4th or 5th generation duplicate of ""Twister"" (1996; and an exciting and excellent weather adventure, with future Oscar winners Helen Hunt and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, as well as Cary Elwes and Alan Ruck, for example, and Bill Paxton recently Sargent Farrell from ""Edge of Tomorrow"" - all showing up with excellent actor skills, loads of charisma and talent). ""Into the Storm"" was NOTHING even remotely close to a finished, professional movie, let alone ""Twister."" Second: The ""acting"" was so bad it would look bad even if it was on a YouTube skit. I won't go into line-by-line analysis, and instead will just say it is wooden, emotionless, and so unconvincing I had to remind myself they were actors in the same movie - ANY movie.The only way the acting could have been more dead and flat is if the actors held their Xeroxed copies of their scripts and read the lines verbatim.Saying such things about a movie that maybe many people worked very hard to create and produce is not a good feeling. I promise, I am not trying to be mean-spirited, but you need to know what you are in for BEFORE you hire a baby sitter, make evening plans, and plunk down $40 for parking, a couple of tickets, and popcorn and drinks.The actors are probably genuinely great and wonderful humans in whatever careers they have chosen... but please, please, PLEASE make that not acting.BTW- The special effects were very good - maybe spectacular. The model building and FX shots were actually top-notch. Too bad the script was so lame, it could not make all that good looking disaster seem interesting.",negative
Into the Storm,"I will have to admit, this movie scared the hell out of me. I have not been able to say that in many, many years. It was an awesome, frightening, very realistic movie.Need to add, there were some points where I nearly cried as well, when things got really bad.A couple of the scenes where very heartfelt, and a single, hasty choice turned into the memory of a lifetime.Completely unexpected events take place, things you never would have thought up. Strangers brought together, and a happy ending where I thought there would be a tragedy.I will mention that I have not gotten scared by a movie in most of my life, but this movie scared the living Hades out of me, and I was so glad my bf was there because I got to snuggle close and hold on to him. I did not expect the movie to be so intense, and life-like, but you will never know until you see it, how realistic it is.",positive
Escape Plan 2: Hades,"The acting is mediocre at best. The cinematography is just terrible. most of the movie is filmed with a handheld camera and the cameraman has parkinsons.
Imdb has not listed any budget for this movie and that is because there is no budget. CGI is awful, explosions and gunfire is so fake that there are no words to describe how bad it is. There is one cool scene and that is the barfight. Other than that there is nothing good about this movie. One of the worst sequels in history.",negative

The Happytime Murders,"For years moviegoers have had to deal with what I call the ""preview problem,"", a term I just pulled out of my nether regions. The preview problem is easy to explain: the folks that make movie previews have one job and one job only, and that is to sell the film they are advertising. The trouble begins with the fact that they have gotten very good at this. It doesn't matter the quality or type of film or even if you end up liking it or not. These guys could not care less about audiences' opinions if they came in a book labeled ""The Picture Book of Colonoscopies."" As soon as those butts are comfortably ensconced in theater seats their job is done. And they will go to some pretty far lengths in order get that essential opening weekend box office moolah: From showing scenes that are not actually in the finished film to giving a completely wrong expectation of the movie in question. And so, with come to The Happytimes Murders, a film that overpromises and disappoints worst than a teenage boy on prom night. On its face, the premise presented on the trailer is almost genius in its simplicity. What if we had a Muppets movie for adults? The analogy is not entirely glib being the movie was directed by the revered Jim Henson's own son, Brian, making his feature-length debut. By all expectations this should have been if not a hilarious sleeper hit, then at the very least, a little funny. It is not. What went wrong? It's not the fact the writers throw every tired old detective movie cliché at the screen in an attempt to remake ""The Maltese Falcon"" with puppets and foul language. And it is also not the issue that, as shown in the trailer, puppets simulating sex is NOT inherently funny. Team America proved that premise could be hilarious that 14 years ago. 
No, the trouble is that the writers et al. forgot that what makes Muppets, cartoons and marionettes interesting in the first place is that they live by their own set of rules. Consider the classic ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" Cartoons living in a human world but following cartoon rules. Putting puppets in a human world, obeying human rules misses the point of puppets completely and makes for a film that annoys rather than entertain. If anything, this just proves that you can't just throw a bunch of curse words and sex jokes and expect a hit.But even all that could be forgiven if the film didn't commit the worst sin of all and that is misusing a particular stellar cast of comedians. Maya Rudolph, Joel McHale, Elizabeth Banks and Michael McDonald have maybe 3 minutes of funny screen time between them. And while ostensibly the film is about a murder mystery, not making Melissa McCarthy funny is the real crime here.",negative

Jane Got a Gun,"I had high hopes for this film because the lead is a woman. But I was so very disappointed. This western story has been done to death and putting a woman as the hero did not help. I saw nothing that I have not seen before. I was not impressed by Portman, with her oh so fake and over done southern accent. The first two flash backs were well placed, but the rest were not needed. The chemistry between the two was a flop.I now understand why I did not see much about this film before I watched it. For this lover of westerns it was a big let down. This film added nothing to the western genre. The 'big names' associated with this film did not help, they are better actors than this.

Teen Titans GO! To the Movies,"If you're looking for a fun time at the movies and don't want a plot quite as intense as mission impossible, I suggest you check this out. The irreverent humor and many references will keep even the most avid cynic of this show intrigued.
What this movie has that too many adult comedies lack is a heart. I was genuinely surprised that I actually cared about Robin's ups and downs throughout the movie due to the surprisingly well-written story. Yes, the movie has the occasional fart joke, but it's not overdone. In fact, the movie is quite aware that those types of jokes aren't for everyone, so it often utilizes them to make fun of itself.
It is at times a little predictable, but it has enough going for it that makes the story thematically consistent. It even references it's own cliches and predictableness in a funny way.
My only main complaint is the pacing. I think the main reason for this is that the story appears to have its conflict resolve, and it takes awhile for the story to pick up steam again.
Comedies can often get overly cynical, but this movie looks to appeal to the heart of the fanboy and dreamer in all of us and accomplishes it. Even if you don't like the movie, I suggest you stick around for the end credits scene because it's got something older fans can get excited for.",negative

"I, Frankenstein","There's something to be said for big, dumb blockbusters featuring immortal creatures of the undead, gargoyles, demons and a whole lot of CGI. That's especially true now, during awards season, when the cinemas are otherwise crowded with Important Movies that might be worthy but difficult to watch. I, Frankenstein even lurches into cineplexes with a bit more credibility than is typically attached to C-grade movies: usually reliable character actors Aaron Eckhart, Miranda Otto and Bill Nighy have signed on to rain hellfire (or something) down on one another. It's a shame, then, that the overly dour film wastes rather than benefits from their talents.Forced into a shambling semblance of life, Victor Frankenstein's dark, brooding creation (Eckhart) stalks bitterly through the centuries. He's hunted mercilessly by the forces of evil - flame-streaked demons led by the nefarious Prince Naberius (Nighy). On the side of good are the gargoyles, a peaceable clan who enjoy the blessing of the heavens and are led by the beautiful Queen Leonore (Otto). Bequeathed the name of Adam by Leonore, Frankenstein's creature soon discovers that he is the factor that could tip the scales in the immortal battle between the demons and the gargoyles.I, Frankenstein is entirely too grim for its own good. Kevin Grevioux's screenplay, adapted from his graphic novel of the same title, marches forward in workmanlike fashion. Plot 'twists' can be seen coming from miles away - see the sassy blonde scientist (Yvonne Strahovski) directed to investigate Adam's origins grow increasingly fascinated with her science project! There are precious few shades of complexity to be found in the film, the characters never really breaking free of their archetypes - beyond the fact that the good guys morph into huge, stony, winged gargoyles that aren't particularly pleasing to the eye. Fiery explosions and bone-crunching battles abound, but they never amount to very much in emotional terms.The unexpectedly good cast liven things up a little, though not by enough to drag I, Frankenstein out of the doldrums. Eckhart storms stoically through the film, a singular grave expression carved into his features like so much rigor mortis. Nighy seems to be having fun even while phoning in his performance. As for Otto and Strahovski, both actresses are competent but largely colourless in their roles.Genre flicks like this one don't usually have to check a lot of boxes to be fun nights out at the cinema. The Underworld franchise - from the same producers - proved just that, spinning its surprisingly rich tale into four films that haven't been critically successful but have nevertheless cultivated their own fans. On the strength (or lack thereof) of the gloomy, predictable I, Frankenstein, it seems unlikely that it will kickstart a new franchise in quite the same way.",negative
"I, Frankenstein","Don't get where all these negative comments come from. I, Frankenstein isn't that bad.I very much liked the new take on the story but it seems like a lot of you guys just wanted to see a remake of the original. Well just watch the original than. Aaron Eckhart plays the role of the tormented monster excellent. I also liked Yvonne Strahovski's performance. Overall the cast was very good.The special effect where great what makes watching the fights very entertaining. I read a lot of reviews where they say that it all looked very fake and copied. Well it did't to me. In my eyes it was worth watching and deserves an 8/10. If however you hope to see the tale of Frankenstein like it was in the original movie this maybe isn't for you.",positive
The Gunman,"Egotistical Penn all he does during the movie is show off......how he beats up a whole group of African mercenaries that wanted to kill him (a yeah right....important subject) .......and that is what the movie is about.....he beats up everybody that crosses his path.....is a ""Rocky/Rambo"" wannabe......to late to jump in that van wagon.....he shows off his steroids like built arms.....he even shows himself surfing (lame).....at the end he even gets the girl (that he couldn't in real life)....it seems like a corny commercial to sell a worn product (himself)....very sad!.....he is almost sixty.....and think he is going to fool anybody......big mistake....worst movie.....and insult to the movie aficionado.....even a regular ""Joe"", can't be that gullible.....",negative
The Gunman,Wow I loved this movie it was Superb in my opinion and I never pay attention to critics now-a-days because you can never trust them to a certain degree. I will say that this movie is incredibly well done and filmed. The film is directed by Pierre Morel who directed Taken and From Paris with Love so he a ton of experience with action style movies and it definitely shows. The story is easy to understand and cliché yes but put together nicely and while there is a ton of talking that just makes the action scenes even more desirable in my opinion. The acting was top-notch by Sean and as for Idris Elba and Javier Bardem they were in it here and there but not much and they did all right but nowhere near there performances of the past. The action is where it is at in this film there are maybe half a dozen action scenes but Phenomenal I must say that had me believe this is definitely an R rated Taken and it shows. I would recommend any fans of Taken and or Casino Royale to watch this movie.,positive

The Girl with All the Gifts,"I know many of you reading this probably won't care, because of the praise this movie is getting, but this is one of the most blatant rip offs I have seen in recent memory.Let me recap: The story involves a post apocalyptic setting where a strain of Cordyceps fungus has mutated. Infecting most of the population, turning them into violent mutated zombie like humans who attack and eat anyone and anything. The fungus is transmitted through bites, but the longer humans are infected they can begin to spread the disease by becoming immobile and beginning sprouting pods that shoot spores into the air, spreading the fungi even more. But years after the infection begins we find a girl. A special girl who is immune to the effects of the fungus. A group searching for a cure learns of the girl and wants to bring her to a center/base to use her to create the cure. She has a protector that starts off looking after her as just a job, but begins to care for her. But then her protector learns that creating the cure with the help of this special girl involves killing her. Now they have to decide if they can live with sacrificing her to save the world. And now you have the full plot of The Last of Us. A critically acclaimed and award winning video game that came out in the summer of 2013. A full YEAR before the book was even published. Could this be a coincidence? Sure. Maybe. But come on...This gets a 1 star for being a complete rip off and doing it worse than the video game. If it wasn't a rip off it would be an OK movie at best.",negative
The Girl with All the Gifts,"I remember once having a ridiculous drunken dispute at a works Christmas party many year's ago that went along the lines of ""if you had the chance to save the world, but had to kill your child to do it, what would you do"". There's a variant of this conundrum at the heart of this brilliant new film from Colm McCarthy, best know for his TV work on shows like ""Peaky Blinders"", ""Sherlock"" and ""Dr Who"".As most people already realize, this is a 'Zombie film' (cue, a number of other single blokes in the cinema) and illustrates the dangers of not treating that Athlete's Foot as soon as it appears! I would normally provide a quick synopsis here, but I really think this is a case in point where it is best to go into the film as blind as possible to the story and let it envelop you. (This includes not watching the whole trailer if possible.) To merely set the scene, we open with a morning school ritual like none you've seen before: children strapped to wheelchairs by heavily armed military in their cells; wheeled to an underground classroom; then made to sit in serried rows being taught by their teacher Helen Justineau (a deliciously un-made-up and natural Gemma Arterton). What IS going on? Who ARE these children? WHY are the soldiers so scared and dismissive of them? The ever-great Paddy Considine (""Pride"") plays army Sergeant Parks (who also has a bit of a crush on Helen) and Glenn Close plays Dr Caroline Caldwell, who is studying the children in more ways than one.This trio of stars, supported notably later in the film by Fisayo Akinade as the trooper Kieran, turn in what is a superb ensemble performance. As for Glenn Close, I have never quite been able to shake her awful ""silk blouse"" performance in ""Air Force One"" from my mind, but here she is quite mesmerizing in the role of the Doctor on a mission: I would suggest a career best. Her final scene reflects such a complex range of emotions, and is brilliantly executed. And Gemma Arterton pulls out all the emotional stops in what is also one of the performances of the year.But good as these performances are, they would be nothing without the central performance of young Sennia Nanua as the titular ""Girl"". I have made the point before that there should be an Oscar category for ""Young Actors"" rather than pitch them into the adult categories like Quvenzhane Wallis and Anna Paquin were (successfully). Here in her debut feature performance Sennia is just mesmerising and (provided this film gets the recognition it justly deserves) she should be a shoe-in for the BAFTA Rising Star award next year, if not an Actress nomination. A young lady most definitely to watch.Also assuming a starring role is Chilean-born composer Cristobal Tapia de Veer's astonishingly effective music which drives up the tension superbly. This is his feature film debut and another name to watch.The screenplay by Mike Carey from his original novel is beautifully crafted, with some great one liners dropped in to ease the tension a notch. And the story adds a level of emotional depth and angst that surpasses other films of this genre, at least as far back as the ""28 Days"" films.Astonishingly, the film was made on a budget of 4 (FOUR!) Million Pounds, giving it a 'BvS quotient' (see bob-the-movie-man.com!) of 2.1%!! Every penny of that budget is up on the screen, and whilst you might like to pick at a few of the matte paintings and effects, it is a remarkably achievement in special effects (Nick Rideout is the SF supervisor) and production value.So, its great! Go see it... but with a few caveats: it is a zombie film, and it ranks about an 8.9 on the splattometer scale, which might not be to some tastes; definitely don't go to see it if you are pregnant (though I am constantly reminded how I took my heavily pregnant wife in 1989 to see ""A really great film called 'Alien'""); and you might want to avoid it if you are a great cat or dog lover, or indeed a pigeon-fancier. Other than that, get yourself down to a multiplex and see this great British film: surely a classic to be recognized for years to come.(You can read the full graphical version of this review on bob-the-movie-man.com.

Let's Be Cops,"After a few minutes, like 2 minutes, you can see what this is all about. Two losers trying to make it in LA, but realizing that is not gonna happen. OK. let's watch this plot for the million time, no big deal... but when you see that Jake Johnson's success moment was appearing in a ad about hemorrhoids (or something like that), you can't avoid to get a little annoyed by the repetition, it's unbelievable that a joke so overdone like that one keeps getting screen time.This is a lazy movie, all the jokes where done before, and multiple times, it tries to appeal to being ludicrous-funny, i think, but it's just ludicrous, everything that happens appears to be the product of the imagination of a 12 year old that devotes his life to watch and love generic sitcoms. I recommend to see this, non the less, because is a very very good example of the absolute decadence of comedy, having moronic stories and repeating the same jokes of the last 30 years.",negative
Let's Be Cops,"This was actually pretty funny. Seeing that this is a Wayans Brothers movie I wasn't sure if it would be too corny or have too many D&F jokes too tolerate. Usually if the comedy is too dumbed-down / ""family friendly I'm out. But I was actually entertained. The D&F humor was actually funny (giant naked man) and it wasn't the crux of the movie. There's actually a good buddy cop theme here, it's hilarious to see them test the limits of their new cop powers, the antagonists are really threatening. There's a good action theme that goes along with this story, I enjoyed it. I was surprised to see Andy Garcia (Untouchables) or Jon Lajoie (from Youtube / The League) to be in this movie, two of my favorite actors.",positive
6 Days,What should have been a tense exciting retelling of the Iranian Embassy Siege is instead a slow moving turgid non event which is not worth the effort.

6 Days,"(I'll take off one point for Abbie Cornishe's bizarre portrayal of Kate Adie.) This is how it's done. If you want to see a cartoon watch ""London has Fallen.""

Good movie for grown- ups.",positive
The Wandering Earth,"I'm baffled by this film and the positive reviews. Despite the fact that it's packed with big set-piece moments, it's dull and hollow. The characters are cardboard cutouts and virtually every element is derivative of American blockbusters. It's Armageddon, Interstellar, Gravity, 2001, and 2012 all mashed up into a barely coherent pastiche.There is only the thinnest veneer of characterization and it's incredibly cliche. There is a rebellious kid who misses his father, a wacky weird side-character with funny hair, a father who had to leave his son, an army guy bound to duty, a comedic genius computer guy. Except none of these characters have chemistry.The premise is so absurd there is little point in explaining it.I'm confused how something like this got green-lit because it isn't even good as propaganda. It is surprisingly devoid of culture. Sure, there are Chinese flags, and Chinese people everywhere, and they celebrate Chinese New Year, but it hardly 'sells' Chinese culture (fashion, music, art). In fact, it just waters down Chinese culture to make it internationally palatable.Everything feels like it's from a checklist, as if they know they have to hit certain notes to imitate a masterpiece, but don't know how to string it together. The CGI effects aren't even good. It's just an assault on the eyes of how much stuff they can cram on the screen.The sound design and sound mixing is also terrible. There is a lack of sound effects and music needed to add depth to the world. It sounds empty and cheap. The music itself is terribly derivative of an American blockbuster.The high user review scores are disappointing because it sets the bar very low for Chinese blockbusters.",negative
The Wandering Earth,"This is so far the best scifi Chinese movie i have ever seen. Honestly speaking, this movie is far more better than similar hollywood movies. if you are not sinophobia and can accept mostly chinese (with subtitle), it will not not let you regret.",positive
The Wall,"The Wall is the latest thriller from director Doug Liman and features Aaron Taylor-Johnson and John Cena as a two man recon team stationed in Iraq who are pinned down by sniper fire and must take refuge behind a wall. Their calls for help are heard by no one...except the enemy sniper. As the battle of wits rages on so does the courage of the two men and their will to survive. This proves to be very beneficial for this film because, honestly, it did not feel like it would be able to sustain a feature length film. However, with the sheer intensity of the film and the perfect performances from Johnson and Cena, The Wall works even when it doesn't.First off, the film is a lean, mean 80 minutes. As soon as the film starts, it starts. There is no warming up to it, it drops you in the movie unapologetic. What comes next is a reckoning of pure adrenaline pumping cinema. Much like last year's The Shallows, The Wall benefits from its bare bones approach. There isn't big explosions or typical warfare, this is more a war of wits which has been done before (and better) but this film is successful in the way that it doesn't need huge action numbers to sustain suspense. Director Doug Liman knows what it is and he knows the strengths are in the performances. It makes for a very interesting addition in the new age war film genre, sitting nicely between The Hurt Locker and American Sniper.Despite all that is well with the film, there are a few moments where you're expecting the film to go one way and then it absolutely does not take any risks and gives you exactly what you expected. For that, I have to say that it was disappointing to not see as much innovation with such a bare bones film. For me, I like when characters are forced to use their environments for their benefit. The Wall definitely did that but in sort of a half-assed way. There really isn't anything clever or cool about the way it all pans out. With that being said, it still makes for an intense movie even if sometimes it feels a little cheap.Overall, The Wall is a short yet intense film that will keep you hanging on until the last frame. The performances from Aaron Taylor Johnson and John Cena are nothing short of amazing. This is especially for John Cena, who absolutely blew me away with his fantastic performance as Matthews. While Cena shines, so does Aaron Taylor Johnson who bucks up and carries the movie on his shoulders without even thinking about it. It stands as Johnson and Cena's best performances to date and it definitely is worth watching.",negative
The Wall,"Greetings again from the darkness. When a director's filmography includes ""big"" action movies like Edge of Tomorrow, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, and The Bourne Identity (the original), the last thing we expect is a stripped-down war movie whose camera focuses on a single character almost the entire run time. Director Doug Liman certainly understands how to use the camera in creating tension and stress, yet while he and writer Dwain Worrell seem so intent on proving the confusion and futility of war, they seem to forget that a thriller needs either a hero to cheer or a villain to jeer.It's late 2007, and the war is winding down as rebuilding efforts are underway. Hulking Staff Sergeant Matthews (John Cena) and his fellow soldier Isaac (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) have been perched and camouflaged on the side a hill for more than 20 hours as they carry out reconnaissance on the site of an under-construction oil pipeline. All they have seen is the remains of a massacre – 8 bodies with no signs of life. Peering through his malfunctioning scope that once belonged to a now-dead friend, Isaac (known as ""Ize"" – get it?) and his training thinks something doesn't seem right. When Matthews deems the site safe, he heads down to check it out. Of course, all heck breaks out and soon enough, an injured Isaac takes shelter alone behind a teetering stone wall. It turns out a sniper, more patient than the American soldiers, had been biding time for the moment.The first eight bodies are construction contractors and a security detail  none of which mattered to the sniper. The hook here is that the sniper hacks into Isaac's radio and seemingly wants to chat it up, rather than finish him off. We never see the sniper, and neither do Matthews or Isaac  but we do hear him plenty. Laith Nakli voices Juba – known to American soldiers as the Angel of Death, responsible for dozens of US casualties. The film spirals into a psychological game of chess – or, more fittingly, the torture of Isaac. This isn't the war we've come to expect in movies. Isaac's situation seems hopeless, and banter with the man responsible never strikes him as a worthwhile pursuit.The biggest issue here is that Juba seems the most interesting character, and not only are we never provided a way to connect with/hate him, we don't even get enough backstory to bond with Isaac. Plenty of obstacles are thrown at Isaac: blowing sand, lack of drinking water, skittles for sustenance, blazing sun/heat, radio issues, and a brutally painful knee wound courtesy of Juba. The success of the movie depends on two things: Aaron Taylor-Johnson selling us on Isaac's predicament, and the radio dialogue between he and Juba. The former is fine, but the latter falls short.Better sniper movies include American Sniper and Enemy at the Gates, while more effective (mostly) one-character thrillers include Locke, Buried, and 127 Hours. The film makes excellent use of sound, but the little jabs at American ideals grows old quickly (such as asking who is the real terrorist). A different approach to a familiar topic deserves a chance, but while Juba only misses on purpose, the efforts of Mr. Liman and Mr. Worrell miss the mark by not engaging the viewer with the character(s).",positive
Point Blank,"Netflix have this amazing ability to draw you in with a action packed trailer then further down the line you realise it's just another Netflix original with no plot.

Redemption,"I now seen another Steven Knight film to realise this man knows London, far better then any writer or director. i do not know how he gets his information my guess is from the films he makes it must be first hand. i loved all 3 films he has done about real gritty side of our London which none other writer or director has in this century. coming back to this movie seen Jason Statham taking on such role is a big surprise as we all know he is an action star not drama, but i have to admit with a good directing he did not do bad in this. i am sure Agata Buzek after this movie will gone to make more movies as she done a great job in this one.i can say the film had a great directing, scenario, camera work and some of the best and most gritty places in London. hummingbird is not for everyone especially those high and mighty educated sort who turns a blind eye to what really goes on London's back streets. but as i lived and seen those there is nothing more appealing to my eyes. i can not choose to be ignorant to life a round me how ever bad or miserable it is, i choose not to be blind and try to do what i can. this movie has only one problem that is trying to fit lots of different stories in 100 minutes and fails if they went with the drama side of it it would have been awards deserving from every aspect. i am hoping Mike Knight continuous with his portrayal of real life of London and not stray away from that like so many others there is not much of his kind left in high society. i say go see the movie if you live in London you just might find something of yourself in it. i recommend this movie any one over the age of 16 as it has lot of violence in it.",negative
Redemption,"I was glad to see Jason Statham in this film. This was the perfect opportunity for him to showcase his acting talent in a rather dark, dramatic role than the usual action-hero roles that he's better known for...and he made good use of it. This one is quite different from the usual 'a guy seeking redemption' story. It is in many ways an introspective kind of film and it does bring out some emotions and make you feel for the characters portrayed by the lead actors (If you're into these kinds of films, of course). If you're expecting this to be another of his high-octane action-thrillers, you may end up disappointed. But if you're looking forward to watch him in a more existentialist role in a well written crime-drama with a few bits of action in it, you'll definitely like it.",positive
Zoolander 2,"i loved Zoolander, thought it was witty and funny, but Zoolander 2 was just rubbish. its just like Owen Wilson and Ben stiller decided to top up there bank balances with this unfunny boring movie.i lost an hour and a half of my life which ill never get back,i would have rather sat in a dentist chair getting my teeth pulled out. Same old jokes nothing original it relied too much on cameo appearances.its a shame because i was looking forward to this movie for the past 15 years. its just like Wilson and stiller didn't have any chemistry together,I've seen some horrible comedies in my life and i can honestly say this was the worst I've ever seen. all i hope is they don't go and make a third one.

Zoolander 2,"I am going to just say, Derek Zoolander & Hansel's first movie was dynamite stuff, really classic and really quite funny. It was always a cool time to pop in my VHS tape with some popcorn and stuff. So when I saw that they had made the second sequel movie film to the first movie that was made, you can bet I was super excited and pumped for it.Well, rightly so, what a film movie! It was perfect. It wasn't recycled at all, it was still just Derek and Hansel being really cool guys and stuff. I was sorry to hear about Derek and his stuff that he had going on, I didn't know it was such a rough time off the runway and stuff, you know, but thats real life, it can sometimes be not the place you ever want to end up ever. It can make you die. So anyway, the scripting was fantastic, and the plot was just great. The cameos were all just fabulously wonderful and absolutely sexy. rawr, folks.All in all, I adored it. And I'm fantastically happy no one else does, because I can have it all to myself, just like the first one. Hah. Suck on that, critics. You just don't get the grown up's humor. Humph.

Kickboxer: Vengeance,"I knew this movie was going to be bad, I knew that it was going to be awful but I didn't expect that it was going to be the trash that it is. One of the worst turds I've ever watched. The film gets the premise of the original film but changing the narrative structure and adding lame new characters and subplots. There is a police subplot and a love story that doesn't even fit in the rest of this disaster...The disastrous editing doesn't help neither, full of abrupt cuts and chopping editing that lacks of emotion of any kind of epic, in fact the training montages are awfully bad and the soundtrack which was one of the biggest virtues of the original film ,here is just horrendous.Alan Moussi is a guy who is very athletic and has good Martial Arts skills but he has zero charisma and even less screen presence and besides that he is a terrible actor .Dave Batista's Tong Po is just a muscle mountain with eyes that doesn't even intimidate and without any kind of depth in his character, he is just there smiling, walking and fighting , nothing else.The girl who plays the protagonist love affair of the film I still don't even know what the she was doing in the movie.The only reason why Gina Carano is making movies nowadays is because she was a MMA star , and she doesn't fight once in the whole movie , why they hired her then? .GSP should keep away from cinema, he is one of the greatest fighters in MMA history but as an actor he is just awful ( He says his famous word ""I'm not impressed by your performance "" in the film, MMA fans will know what I mean :P Jean Claude Van Damme (which is the best of the movie) have some good fight scenes ,overshadowing Moussi by the way , but his performance is nothing special neither, he don't even look to be taking serious the role and he just seem to be there to cash his check and have some fun and. I don't understand neither why they dubbed his voice in many scenes and his fight with GSP wasn't bad but it could have been better...There are so many action sequences but are just decent , nothing really worth to be mention.MMA legends as Cain Velasquez and Fabricio Werdum also appears in the film, but they are wasted, the director didn't know how to take advantage of their skills as fighters, Cain and Vandamme have a fight but is awful...The final fight of the movie is long and boring , it lacks of any kind of thrill or emotion, and is basically a copy of the fight of the original film but lacking of the epic and the magic of that fight.The movie has no personality and the only reason that was made is to cash on the name of a martial arts classic , Van Damme wasn't even the first choice to play the role of the master and he was only hired because they didn't have anyone to play the role.I liked the cameo of Michel Quissi but I didn't enjoy the post credits scene.The worst thing about this is that they are making a sequel now with people as Ronaldinho in the cast :( The only positive thing I can say about the movie is that it makes you realize how great the original film is. it was a production much cheaper than this but it has become in an inspirational classic of martial arts cinema that has been inspired young kids to train for over 30 years.One of the biggest turds ever made, let's move on and forget this trash was never made, the bastard sequels with Sasha Mitchel are even better than this and those movies are not good at all...",negative

Pete's Dragon,"Very flawed film. I can not even say it was cute. It really wasn't. The original was not perfect but certainly better than this rendition. I agree that dragons do not have fur.

Slow, Un-entertaining and bland. I see where they are trying to go with the sentimental folksie vibe. Maybe if more of Mumford and Sons were on the track. Nah, it was not a good Re-Make at all. Junglebook.....remake.....AWESOME!!!",negative
Pete's Dragon,"Liked this a lot. I was 4 when I first saw Pete's dragon way back in '83 or whatever back in England. I remember how much I loved the idea of Pete's dragon. I watched the original a few years back and realized that it was a fairly average musical with an animated dragon. But still!!!! I remember how great the story or idea of a personal dragon was. The modern spin is very sentimental, but never cheesy. Everything was great; from casting to special effects. I really enjoyed this movie. If you remember the old Pete's dragon from back when you were a skid, you'll love this movie. To be completely honest, there were several tear jerker moments. I guess they really nailed down the aspects of a child becoming suddenly orphaned. They also did a really good job if propelling the story so that it never sat idle. Robert Redford played the integral old timer part, but played it exceptionally well as to be expected. It is also relevant to mention that I typically do not review movies I have just seen immediately after I have seen them. This film made an exception for me.",positive
Cell,"First... I did not know anything about this awesome, and I can't say that enough, awesome book becoming a movie. I have had to read this book at least 10 times over the last few years and some of my most favorite life quotes came from this book. So when I saw this as a movie and John as the main role I knew it was going to be amazing. I mean if I could cast the main character myself it would be John.BUT... Well, if the director had made a movie out of the book, it would have been amazing. If the movie had any of the most notable and required pieces of the plot it would have been amazing. If the director had even read anything to do with the book, even the dust jacket, it would have been amazing. But he didn't, he didn't, he didn't.SO... The movie sucked. I don't like to use that type of ""language"" when reviewing anything, but there is no other choices here. Everything about the movie was wrong and I gave it a lot of room, a lot of space to make errors and not flow the same. Because ultimately you want to be surprised by the movie. You ultimately want the director to make it his own just a little bit, put his spin on something and have it shine even more. And I did, I watched the movie to the very end. Checked behind the credits and everything. And now I wish I would have gone on for the rest of my life without knowing this movie existed. IF... Now one might think by my review that had you not read the book, you might have liked it but sadly that is not true. This is not only the worst adaptation of a book ever, but it is also just poorly put together, scripted, acted, and there is no redeemable quality anywhere.Such as... The sound effects were horrible, the video tried to be dark and creepy, but it was just bland. There was very little action or scare factor other than some BOO moments from the ""zombies type people."" If you didn't see something coming from a mile away it is because it made no sense. The ending was a little baffling on how horrible it was. I mean I am actually trying to think of one thing. Just one that I can say and would take this movie from a 1 star to at least a 1.5 star. But I can't. I can't think of a single thing that I can look back on and say that was cool/nice/awesome/not terrible.Lastly... So I will leave you with this. I am actually praying that I reach you before you watched this movie. I am hoping one of your not nice friends didn't play a prank on you and made you pay for this movie. It is my desire that this review has reached you before you have wasted one single heartbeat within the vicinity of this horrible, horrible film mistake.

Cell,"I must say I don't really understand the negative reviews. I've read and loved the book, but I was always aware that the movie was not going to be an exact copy of it. Yes, people who expected it to be will be disappointed, but don't spoil the fun for others who just want to see a good movie - because it is still a good movie in itself. Giving a movie a bad rating just because it didn't meet your personal expectations is kind of stupid. You should always try to see the movie and book separately. Some scenes, when translated to a movie screen, just don't come out the same way. What sounds amazing in a novel doesn't need to look fantastic in theaters. And that's coming from a writer.Of course, it is a lot harder to make you feel for the characters on a screen than when you read about them in detail. I still felt for the characters. I like that the movie changed a couple of things, but still kept stuff that will remind you of the book (Alice's white dress, the ice cream truck etc....) Some of those book references were used in a different way, but it made me smile. The new ideas were pretty unique and I don't want to spoil the experience. I think the most important parts were still well performed and - last but not least - it was entertaining, interesting, different, suspenseful. 8 Stars - I take two stars away, because some improvements could have been made.",positive
The Command,"First, The sinking was in August 2000.
The Russian subs used at the Titanic which is referenced in this movie during the failed rescue scene never occurred in that year. They loaned them to James Cameron for his Ghosts of the Abyss from August to Sept in 2001, 1 year after the Kursk sinking. Did anyone research this or just tossed in this inaccuracy for more filler?",negative
The Command,"This is a fictionalization of the Russian submarine disaster that made world-wide news. Adapted from a book, the story runs in multiple alternating stories. Matthias Schoenaerts stars as the submarine officer who has to keep the survivors alive. Léa Seydoux co-stars as his wife, battling for information from the naval authorities who are stonewalling. Colin Firth has a bit part as a British officer, representing the international offers for help. Meanwhile, the severely underfunded Russian navy has only one ill-maintained rescue vessel, and, for political or other reasons, is resisting offers to help from various NATO countries.The underwater scenes were suitably claustrophobic. While different (sometimes under-trained) crew members exhibited different reactions, there was general camaraderie, as also shown in an early sequence where various underpaid crew members sell their watches to help finance a colleague's wedding.A significant bit part is the young son of Matthias Schoenaerts' character, who opens the movie practicing holding his breath underwater - a skill needed for future naval / submarine work. The kid represents the children of the whole crew.I saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival, and was surprised to see that Kursk was in English. The director reasoned that he didn't speak Russian, and the film was about various communities coming together, something that was more universal than it being just a Russian story.Note that I am reviewing this as a movie, not as to whether this is a complete historical document.",positive
