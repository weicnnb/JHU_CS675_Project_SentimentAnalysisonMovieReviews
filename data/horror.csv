The Human Race,"i'm honestly just writing this because of the high score and 2 rave reviews obviously written by people involved with the project. i feel like i was duped into watching it. so here's an honest review: this is a terrible movie. it's poorly written, and badly acted. only exception is the deaf girl. she wasn't bad, given the material she had to work with. it's just lazy filmmaking, seems like. says nothing about the human condition (as purported from the existing reviews), only the sophomoric insight of a film-school reject who saw one too many eli roth movies. seriously, avoid at all costs.",negative
The Human Race,"The first thing you need to know about this film is that it is low- budget, funded by a kickstarter project and it doesn't have a single person in it that is known in the movie world. That being said, this film is a brilliant indie that deserves to be in the spot-light. Smart, creative, well-made and seriously dark and disturbing, The Human Race restores my faith in filmmaking and the movie industry. Although this film is not for the film-goer who can only see films with bloated budgets and celebra-whores, the movie goers that do appreciate a film that takes risks and takes the honest yet disturbing route of displaying characters in ways that you're definitely not use to seeing, you will love and appreciate this film as much as I did. This film takes the classic Battle Royale storyline and pulls it deeper into the horror genre by showing a much darker side of the survival of the fittest as well as creating imagery that borders on comic book fantasy. Setting aside the awesome storyline and the genius way in which the film tells the tale, the director/writer respectfully showcases characters that are disabled yet are the strongest competitors and yet are also the weakest. I am in serious awe of this film and I hope others will enjoy it and see it for what it is as much as I do.Please like me on Facebook!

Go Goa Gone,"Go Goa Gone is truly one of the most hilarious Hindi films since Delhi Belly. It's a zombie comedy, with lots of blood and gore, so it's in no way for the squeamish, and the humor is quite mature, so it's NOT a child-friendly watch, but, hey, it's the subject matter itself which isn't really kid-suitable.Nevertheless, Go Goa Gone sets out to bring a new genre into Indian cinema with great gusto, and it fails to fail. With rib-tickling lines, great comic acting by Kunal Khemu, Vir Das, Anand Tiwari, and even Saif Ali Khan as the quirky, macho Boris (soon to be one of the greatest cult characters of all of Hindi cinema), Go Goa Gone FORCES you to laugh effortlessly.Yes, the plot gets a little dragging at the second half, and Puja Gupta's acting isn't very novel (although she looks great), but mostly, Go Goa Gone just always makes you laugh at one point or the other. I was chuckling at every other moment. The zombies are well-made, for a first in Bollywood, and nothing looks cheap. The action is pretty nice, and the songs are quirky and trippy.I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to have a good laugh-fest. Except the kids, of course...",negative
Go Goa Gone,"It's a rarity for Indian movies to step beyond the conventional(and convenient) love stories and venture into the unknown.'Go Goa Gone' tries that and does a commendable job.You have heard of romcoms,now there is a new genre and it's called 'ZomCom!'.The movie stars Saif Ali Khan,Kunal Khemu,Vir Das and many many zombies.There is good chemistry between the friendly trio of Luv,Hardik and Bunny.There's lot of slapstick humor,plenty of boisterous moments.The trio attend a rave party in Goa where all goes wrong.Thanks to a drug,suddenly zombies are spawning out of the blue and they are hungry for any human they can find.The trio find themselves stranded on an island with zombies all around and no way out.Enter Saif Ali Khan as a Russian mafia Boris.Off late Saif's acting has really transcended to a new level of confidence and this role is an example of that.His character is just so amazing.His dialog delivery with that Russian accent,his intimidating yet adorable looks,his intriguing persona-are all things you will love about him.You get a kick within when he says with that Russian accent- 'I kill dead people'.The rest of the cast has acted pretty good as well and i liked Kunal Khemu's(Hardik) performance.There are plenty of genuinely funny moments.Don't try applying your mind too much or connecting the dots,this one is just meant for fun.Watch it and enjoy!",positive
The Last Exorcism 2,"Never do I rate a movie 1, and the only reason I did on this movie as there was not the ability to rate it a zero or less. The Last Exorcism Part II is a complete waste of time. It is NOTHING like other Exorcism movies, nor is even come lose to being scary. About all you get out of this is a lot of deep looking facial expressions by Ashley Bel who plays Nell. I was so disappointed in that there was nothing really scary, some possessed people who just talk scary, yet the demon is never really there. The scenes were so disjointed, and after 30 minutes, I felt like OK, this has gone so slow up until now, something really scary is going to happen next... I was mistaken. After 45 minutes, I waited, after an hour, I waited, then figuring that this was going to be a great and scary ending.. I waited.. Then the credits roll! ARE you freaking kidding me? This has to be the G rated version of scary movies of all time. Like another review hit on, the only reason it seems that this movie was made was to pry money from those that saw the first movie and thinking this will be a continuation of that. Here is the fact of life, if you go see this movie thinking it is a scary or demonic movie, the Joke will be on you as the movie maker laughs all the way to the bank.",negative
The Last Exorcism 2,"Unlike so many others (general audience not critics) I count my self a fan of the original Last Exorcism. I found the film to be throughly engaging. Funny with some creepiness and a burst of disturbing at its unexpected if slightly hammy conclusion. The no. 1 thing I loved about that film was Cotton the Reverend, the second thing Nell played by Ashley Bell in a physically daunting, creepfest performance. So when I heard they were developing a sequel I was game Because the first film had created characters that I liked. But as the release loomed closer I realized that Cotton wasn't going to be part of the mix which was a little bit of a let down. However even though the trailer looked a little silly, well a lot I wanted to give the film makers props for not going with the know annoying found footage routine and updating out main characters story to something more classically cinematic. The results are mixed but it's safe to say that there's enough to merit a soft recommendation. The film picks up the moments after the events of the original where Nell is found traumatized and brought into a girl's halfway house. Everything seems well enough at first as she begins to adjust to everyday activities. It's a little lifetimeish as she listens to her first ipod, wears some lipstick and has her first real kiss but we like the character and Bell keeps it engaging. But strange things begin to happen and we slowly but surely discovering that the demon from the original is still looking for her to fulfill a prophecy of horrific proportions. It all sounds a little generic but the way in which the material is approached is somewhat interesting because you see the demon has in fact fallen in love with her and is sort of courting her destroying the life around her. It's a n intriguing concept sadly not fully explored but hidden inside this is great one and had they had more a budget to hide this hokey effects (cartoon cgi fire ugh), A more in depth screenplay and a harder rating which would have allowed them to show more this could have been a real blast. There is potential that runs throughout the film populated by solid performances especially for the genre, some decent scares, a creepy indie atmosphere and some really nice cinematography (the shadow work is impressive). But in the end it fails to really deliver on any of its promises which is sad and with its dismal box office and a feisty finale which could have led to something pretty cool it doesn't look like we are going to see another entry. Maybe we'll get lucky and they will explore the concept further on a direct to DVD sequel. But regardless of the films faults of which there are many it's a lot better than most of the big studio crap they've been releasing like The Possession and The Apparition at least there's a story here an an intriguing one at that. 3/5",positive
Devil's Due,"Absolute Dogsh*t is a term that cannot be used enough to describe this movie. I hated the characters (especially the tw*t of a husband), the stupid shaky-cam, the ""scares"", the pathetic sub-plot of an ancient cult, the trailer that gave away absolutely everything, and did I mention the tw*t of a husband? No doubt there'll be a sequel, and another, and another. Remember when there were actually good horror found-footage films? Me neither. Hollywood is just saturated with them, none of them good. A complete and terrible rip-off of Rosemary's Baby. Just don't watch it. If I could give it a minus rating I would. Definitely in the category of one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",negative
Devil's Due,"If you don't like ""found footage"" movies than this might not be for you but if you're okay with movies like Chronicle and Cloverfield then I think you'll really enjoy this movie. But it's more like a really sad love story than a crazy horror movie.It made me laugh a little at first and then it made me really tense and nervous. It was creepy the whole time. And I felt for the couple all the way through. They were great actors.Most people seem to write this off because it's ""found footage"" but the movie seems to flip that like Chronicle did and doesn't need the footage to have been found by anyone. I don't usually have a problem with ""found footage"" anyway and I respect the use of cameras in this because they always had cool ways to do it without explaining it to me over and over like I'm stupid, like they do in Chronicle. My friends I saw it with missed the hidden cameras getting installed and the lapel camera the husband wears and so they didn't like it but if you watch closely it's all pretty well explained.This isn't the best movie I've ever seen but it's a lot better than people say.",positive
Big Bad Wolves,"You'd think a guy that had been kidnapped, abused, tortured would ask at least once: ""Why, why me? What reason do you have to suspect me?"" Not this one. Is he too proud? Or do they hire imbeciles to read Torah studies in Israel? I've no idea. I just know that this is NOT how people behave, this looks false. The pleas of this guy is not what you'd expect from a bewildered person in pain. It doesn't even matter if he's guilty or not. Whoever wrote the screenplay for this should go into his basement, chew off his fingers and feed them to his dog. What I'm trying to say here is - don't write any more screenplays, please. PLEASE!",negative
Big Bad Wolves,This film is not for everyone. It takes one of the most disgusting subjects imaginable and turns it into a twisted comedy. You're laughing your head off while castigating yourself for ignoring the dark subject matter which reeks of absolute depravity. But it is funny and you can't help yourself. And so you laugh. But the film keeps you at the edge of your seat gnawing on your knuckles. The male lead is one of my very favorite actors in film today and once I discovered him which was not that long ago I decided to get every film he made and this one came up in my research. No matter how unpalatable the subject matter of this film this actor shines like the star he is. You just cannot take your eyes off him. And that is true star power.,positive
Meet the Blacks,"My first review, and maybe my 3rd or 4th rating. 
I love the most movies and series, so I never rate them if it isn't amazing. But this movie is a waste of time. 
I saw 14 minutes and stopped it. The next day I saw 20 minutes more, just to give lt a chance but it suuuucks! It's so cringy and stupid without being funny. The cast is ok but they can't act in this movie because the script is SO terrible. Later that same day I thought ""watch the movie maybe it's ok"" but now I just wanna sue both netflix, the cast, the producers and the writers. 
Don't watch this crap it's a wate of time and your life.",negative
Meet the Blacks,At this point if you are still trying to break down a parody movie from every angle and inspect it then you are wasting your time. Parody movies are literally designed to not be a good movie. The only thing it's for is to make you laugh. Everyone knows this so why every time a new one is made people expect more? Honestly these type of movies are for people who like to laugh and usually don't care how it turns out. I understand some of you may feel if it's a theatrical release then it should be at least worth the money but it's very hard to please everyone when it comes to music and art and it has always come down to a preference thing. I am giving this a 10 out of 10 because it made me laugh the whole time and that's all these movies are made for. I expected nothing else from it and I got nothing else from it.There was no great story line or amazing actors just good Ole parody humor.,positive
The Canal,"After reading description on IMDb before watching this flick, thought like its kind of haunted house or another sinister like movie & i guess i was right...But if you using already used concept in your current movie, then you should be able to give something more interesting to audiences than its original version. Fortunately director & script writer tried to do so but unfortunately as end product the film wasn't that effective.Movie is horror thriller but apart from some good jump scares, it doesn't gives you much more as movie to remember. Thriller & Fear element is badly missing.Off course you can watch this movie, but even if you don't watch, you are not going to miss anything important...",negative
The Canal,"I don't know why the IMDb score and Metacritic score are so low on this one. That's one of the reasons I put off watching it for a while but I'm so glad I finally got around to seeing it; it's one of the better horror films of recent years, and I'm a huge horror junkie. If you like disturbing horror that gets under your skin and doesn't rely on jump scares or constant gore then this is for you. The film is beautifully shot and has some exceptionally creepy visuals. It's sporadically violent and cruel but every moment of blood letting or grotesquerie is expertly handled and actually frightening rather than pure gross-out. I urge you not to watch the trailer as it contains spoilers I wish I hadn't known before going into it. If you want to know what to expect, I'd say it's got elements of films such as The Shining and The Ring, but it has a very unique feel. There's a nice dose of drama along with the horror and Rupert Evans is thoroughly believable and engaging in the lead role, much more so than your average modern horror protagonist. Highly recommended!",positive
The Possession of Michael King,"This review may not contain a spoiler, but I ticked it anyway. This is a cheaply made, badly acted and scripted, possible student film.It is completely unoriginal, except for the fact that the main character purposely tries to become possessed as opposed to unknowingly. This may be because of his wife accidentally dying, but it's never made clear why, seem to be just an experiment he's performing on himself, out of depression maybe, we don't know, he seems fairly chipper in the beginning. Since when do things happen for a reason in C grade films? He has a young daughter still living with him, but he continues on his course of trying to become even more and more possessed, till he gets out of control, trashes the house, and his sister takes his kid off him. The talking was too quiet, then sound effects were way too loud and abrasive, trying to maintain their cheap 'jump' scares that always fell flat. People connected with the film have once again inflated the scoring, it's definitely a one star film, avoid this poor excuse of a movie.I would like to offer a way it could have been better, but the story and plot were weak, the acting was weak, writing was dull, the look of the film was not consistent yet the settings were pretty much all in the house. The grave scene with the priest, that kinda went in another direction there where he was getting teeth sewn into his belly to summon the spirit of a dead corpse. Then it was back to the house for the rest of the film till its inevitable end. Please stop making this type of complete crap, conning the general public to rent or buy it, nobody in the real world would rate this stinking movie, nobody.",negative
The Possession of Michael King,"Just finished watching this movie. I didn't think I would like this film at all and almost turned it off right at the start because I read its similar to the blair witch project and paranormal activity. I watched this late at night on my own in the dark so conditions for viewing this type of film were pretty good. The film didn't disappoint. It's very intense, fast moving and quite scary. This film was the exact opposite to what I was expecting. I thought it was going to be a waste of 90 mins like 80% of horror films. I couldn't fault anything about the movie. Very impressive work by Yung and whoever else was involved. Acting all round was top notch. Well, give it a shot. I doubt many will be disappointed.",positive
V/H/S Viral,"This movie is borderline unwatchable. I tried watching this in two sittings and by the third I fell asleep. It's so bad, it's like they hunted down the worst horror writers and directors in hopes to sabotage a continuing V/H/S franchise and they succeeded. The camera-work is horrendous. It makes the final fight in Alex Cross look like The Raid 2. Awkward edits, annoying static every five seconds, terribly uninteresting plots and terribly written too. It's a shame because there was much potential from the first two V/H/S movies that this could become a good horror anthology franchise because it's such a great premise and found-footage is best in small 20-30 minutes doses but this movie tried to make an actual story with a couple random segments that make no sense. Gun to my head, if I had to pick the best segment it would have to be the one with the alien penises. That sentence alone should tell you enough about this movie. It was such a dumb segment and it made no sense but actually attempted suspense and some form of story. The main story is dogsh*t. I hate this movie a lot. I remember thinking after V/H/S/2 ""man, what a great idea for a horror franchise. I hope they continue these"" and then Viral had to come along and take a heaping dump on film and sell it as a V/H/S movie. If you liked the first two V/H/S movies, don't watch this. Don't ever watch this movie unless you want to feel depressed and p*ssed off in which case by all means V/H/S: Viral is the only thing you should watch. This movie sucks balls. It should have never been made and whoever greenlit this atrocious script should be fired if they haven't been already. I wish I could unwatch this movie. Spare yourselves.",negative
V/H/S Viral,"I watched this movie at the Lisbon Horror Movie Festival (MotelX); when I did, I hadn't watched any of the previous ones (now I have), so I did't really know what I was going to see, and I quite enjoyed the experience.As its predecessors, V/H/S Viral is formed by three found-footage stories, tied together by yet a fourth frame story, also filmed in a found-footage fashion. (Apparently there was supposed to be one more segment, directed by Todd Lincoln, but it was never filmed or it didn't make the final cut).The frame story, ""Vicious Circles"" by Marcel Sarmiento, is quite unsettling. It starts with a police car chase of an ice-cream van, and a young couple much in love who is split by the intrusion of pure horror in the form of viral videos that appear in their mobile phones. This story is split in four small segments, some very brief, others much longer, until the final scene which closes the circle, so to speak. It was in general quite enjoyable, with some concessions to gore, a few clichés flowing around and some very enjoyable scenes. The use of music in the very last segment (Beethoven's 9th symphony) was very clever, in my opinion. My score for this story, 7,5/10.The second story (first of the viral videos), filmed by Gregg Bishop, is more a mockumentary than a found-footage, although it obviously includes many ""interviews"" and closed-circuit camera footage. It tells the story of ""Dante the Great"", who always dreamed of being a magician and got to do so when he discovered a mysterious cape: a cape that was so powerful that apparently it frightened Houdini himself. This story is the least gore of all the pack, and it is in a way quite predictable, but it is well executed. The main sin for me is that at one point the movie abandons the ""found-footage"" form and includes some scenes with a more traditional filming; and that is hard to accept in a movie that is precisely about videotapes being found. Score: 6/10.""Parallel Monsters"", by Nacho Vigalondo, is probably the best of them all. It is filmed in Spanish and has a slightly different look, more professional, more acted, less realistic in a way. It tells the story of a scientist who opens a gate to another parallel universe, only to find that in that universe there is another version of himself, who has built exactly the same machine. When they decide to exchange universes for 15 minutes, he will discover that there are in fact a few, ahem, minor differences between their universes. This segment is quite original, very funny, very cruel; it explores its premise with intelligence and leaves quite a few things unexplained (which is not a bad thing at all). The only thing that disappointed me a bit was that the development of the story turns to more conventional horror clichés. In any case, I am giving it a 9/10.""Bonestorm"", by Justin Benson & Aaron Moorhead, follows a group of teenage American skaters who decide to go to Tijuana to explore an abandoned skating park and film some videos. When they get there, they get haunted by a death-worshiping cult (or something similar) who used that skate park as their ceremonial ground. The premise is extremely simple, and apart from a few scares and gore scenes you won't get much out of it. The best part is the humor in the creation of the characters. Score: 7/10.All in all, I enjoyed the experience. The segments are obviously uneven, but I guess that's inevitable in a collective movie. Nacho Vigalondo's segment is one level above the rest, followed by the frame story by Marcel Sarmiento. After watching the three films of the trilogy, I think it was a good idea to abandon the ""damned videotape"" idea and update it in a form of viral videos, which allows for a different kind of frame story.Oh, and I think the movie is trying to tell us something about our urge to be famous at any cost and by any means, but quite sincerely, I don't think anyone who sees this movie will really care about that.Overall score: 7/10",positive
XX,"Proposing a collection of original shorts in a horror landscape over-saturated with remakes and old recipes is a daring proposition, with or without gender twist. XX delivers four 20 minutes works with an episodic animated sequence as interlude. While the animated part is simply masterful, the quality of the shorts varies. 1st Short: The Box. This short seems to draw an illustration of how a dysfunctional family would end up if closeted drama and shouting exchanges were replaced by a supernatural element. Rather ambient, it lets you wonder what to expect. Unfortunately, the conclusion misses the target and leaves you wanting something more elaborate. 2nd Short: The Birthday party. Expedited premise and hardly believable character behavior make this short rather weak. It seems to be intended as a joke and it sort of, kind of work if you're a good audience. Good material for fan theory, but nothing memorable. 3rd Short: Don't fall. Typical monster story, with all the clichés of the genre packed into way too little time to deliver any kind of tension. A success if you want to watch absolutely every (bad) monster film in 20 minutes, a failure if you're looking for anything else. 4rh Short: Her only living son. The best of the lot, with a tense ambiance from early on, and the only one with enough background to establish a more solid story line. The female lead knows how to act, and the dramatic arc is built better than in the 3 other shorts. Nonetheless, some of the narrative is expedited and make the story fall a bit flat. Ultimately, the bundle gives the impression that none of the stories were meant for the short format to begin with, and try to follow the same formula as full feature films while condensing it in 20 minutes. As a result most of the shorts rest on interesting ideas but none seems to know whether to be a trailer or a feature film, to the detriment of tension and narrative. It remains that there are far worse movies around. ""The box"" and ""Her only living son"" have a compelling second level of reading and can push your empathy buttons just right, and ""The Birthday Party"" might make you smile (""Don't Fall"", though is a total miss). Funnily enough the 20 minutes format, as ambiguous as it is, also makes sure that no story overstays its welcome. I'll give it a 5 for effort and for the animation. Watch it if you want something a bit different, and for some good starting ideas if you're a fiction writer. Give it a rain check if you're looking for a mind-blowing work. The good: Interesting ideas + Good metaphors + Refreshing formula + Masterful animated intermezzos The meh: - Average acting - Narrative doesn't fit the format well - Soundtrack could be more subtleThe bad: - The whole 3rd short (Don't fall). - The mood lapse between the 1rst and 2nd short.",negative
XX,4 stories of absolute bull crap. This was the most eye rolling movie I seen in 5 years. I watch horror Z movies on Amazon prime movies with dirt for a budget that's 10 times better than this horse turd. I don't even think SJWs and White Knights can recommend this. Nothing was explained in this. If anything 3 out of 4 of these made the women look weak. I wouldn't recommend this crap if someone offers TO GIVE $5 TO WATCH.,positive
Willow Creek,"I'll be honest. This film definitely went for full Blair Witch and just barely did not make it. On the upside though, it did get very close. Willow Creek is one of those movies that although it doesn't quite scare you, it leaves you unnerved. The film is very amateur but this serves to benefit the film. The buildup is fantastic but in my opinion, the payoff was a tad lackluster, but perhaps that is just because i wanted to know more. Willow Creek is by no means a masterpiece of horror but it is a very effective shaky cam film with good suspense and eerie atmosphere. Warning though, some parts of this film do drag on... a lot. The beginning of the film lasts forever, and one scene in particular drums up the suspense well but ultimately runs too long in the middle of this very short movie. If you read about this film and immediately though you might be interested, watch it. I did not go in expecting too much, but I was pleased with what I saw.",negative
Willow Creek,"This really worked for me. I know the usual contingent is out with cries of, ""Boring!"" and ""Worst movie I ever saw!""... but... whatever. They show up for everything short of Chainsaw Gynecologist IV. First off... if you don't like found footage movies, you won't like this. If you didn't like The Blair Witch Project or June 9, you won't like this. If you can't stand low budget movies that don't have loads of special FX and jump cuts... you definitely need to look elsewhere.Willow Creek is a slow convincing build-up to a chaotic slap of weirdness. Everything leading up to that ending is atmosphere and getting to know the characters and ramping up the dread of what might happen to folks who wander out into the woods looking for monsters. There's a LONG scene in a tent with the characters becoming increasingly terrified... can you watch long scenes where not much happens? Do you have that sort of patience? If so you might like this movie as much as I did. Also, I'd say the real horror of the film doesn't sink in until after a few moments are taken to mull over the implications of what we see in those final moments. How they were foreshadowed early on. It's a creepy movie and I'm glad I watched it.",positive
Cheap Thrills,"I had no idea what to expect with this film. It's a decent story with two men who are both pretty much going bankrupt meeting each other while drinking at the bar and then they end up making some money they desperately need when a rich guy starts offering them cash in exchange for performing different challenges for his and his wife's amusement. The money keeps going up to get them to do more and more things that get bigger and ever crazier.The best part of the movie is David Koechner's performance, he is really hilarious.Worth seeing but don't bother buying it or paying to see it at the theatre, it's just Okay.",negative
Cheap Thrills,"I did not expect to like this movie, but It slowly pulled me in with it's desperation, humor, horror, and ethical dilemmas.Cheap Thrills has a little story, but it's big in suspense, intrigue, and insanity.This movie excels at dark humor. Although the story becomes increasingly ridiculous, the character reactions are grounded enough that it makes the mayhem seem entirely plausible.There's also a subtle depth to the movie that begs to be explored. It's thought provoking while being mostly entertaining.",positive
The Vault,"The criminal gang featured in the movie was a motley crew that initially seemed competent, then they sort of disintegrated but not as the horror script would suggest as they began to disappear. Instead most of them succumbed to a poor script. Using the typical eerie music along with some strains of Alien (1979) chords the movie proceeds to include the intermittent lights blinking in and out. There's no clear explanation behind the robbery. In several instances, some of the criminals are so nasty that it encouraged that they meet a miserable demise. And why spend manpower on one person unnecessarily guarding bank hostages instead of just locking them in some unescapable room or why let another person kill themselves when there was plenty of time to prevent it? And who threatens a hostage in order to get answers without using a weapon in order to encourage a more truthful response under the circumstances, except when it comes to female bank tellers? The movie also includes a somewhat sympathetic criminal character being tormented towards innocence by a female bank teller for supposedly an additional layered subplot but that is more of a distraction. Then there's even a bullet through a window scene that doesn't make real sense as a script-driven dramatic device even with a surprisingly decent attempt to explain it away. Even the reported past bank robbery attempt story doesn't hold up in regards to law enforcement protocol and seems much more scripted just for supposedly the horror affect but it's pretty absurd. Instead of a truly professional group of bank robbers against a haunting unknown, the heightened dynamics is lost in contrast to The Devil's Tomb (2009) or even the more straight forward but much more compelling The Numbers Station (2013). With this particular criminal gang, its little wonder that they disappeared so fast, unfortunately for the audience not fast enough. The short, The Vault seems to follow most of the typical horror movie attempts at scare scenarios which by now have become either familiar or the audience just inured to it. There's very little in the way scary scenes or originality. There's one promising scene later in the movie involving a girl, but it's not really followed up with and used only for an attempted scare that becomes only another typical fright shot. Suddenly with only about twenty minutes to go there's a big turn around but again unfortunately, the absence of a good backstory takes a lot out of the emotional appeal of the climatic ending. There's even a Sixth Sense (1999) flavor in this movie that could have had potential towards making this a decent movie. But it's all too little too late and unconvincing as well as the final typical, boring, over-used, clique shot that definitely didn't redeem the movie.",negative
The Vault,"This film tells the story of a group of five bank robbers who aim to rob half a million dollars from the bank. The think they hit the jackpot when the assistant manager of the bank offers help to get them six million dollars from the mysterious underground vault.""The Vault"" is a very low budget film, and it really shows. That in itself is not a problem, if it had a good story and tight editing. Unfortunately, there is not much to fill the screen time, and the pacing is just really slow. It takes the robbers thirty minutes to get to the vault, and then another thirty minutes for things to get going. There are many implausible or illogical things happening in the film too. I find it implausible that there is only one man trying to open the vault, while the two women watch on CCTV. Could they not have helped with opening the vault? It is a low budget B film through and through. There will be fans who like this film, but it is not for me.",positive
Incarnate,"I was fuming by the time I left the theatre.I cannot begin to tell you how much I absolutely loathe that a premise that has so much potential gets butchered the way this one did.We finally get a main character who could be so unique – not only is he a scientist, which finally takes away the only approach made on these movies which is the religious one – but he can also get in people's minds. And what do we get instead? The epitome of all clichés. And there are so many of them, don't even get me started. There is the scruffy grief-stricken widower with nothing to lose, a religious crisis and a long time vendetta, there are his couple of sidekicks with the fancy aura reading machines (except here they are ion charges or something), and the secretive mentor and the deadly serum that the mc says he is never going to use but you so know he is gonna – and the rest is just filler for something that could be truly creepy.Incarnation grabbed my attention from the get go, particularly with that initial dance club scene, which featured the most perfect song for the moment and gave me an almost Matrix vibe. We quickly know what is going on, what our main guy is capable of doing and how he is doing it – all through the natural sequence of the story, not because the information is dumped on the viewer. And that approach pretty much stops there.From that point on it all went downhill. There are so many plot holes (Why call it Maggie?? Even the demons called it Maggie! It's the name of an innocent woman, for crying out loud. Why does Ember need to almost die if he says he found out about his ability while he was sleeping? Why not just give him a powerful sedative? Why did the entity target Ember so particularly? I mean, if it wanted to keep possessing people it should have left him minding his own business, not helping anyone cause he was just trying to lead a normal life, right? Why was the boy not tied up if it was so dangerous for him to touch anyone? Come to think of it, why did it just stand there? Why did people touch Ember on the street seconds after yelling for people not to touch him? There is so much more but I forgot it in the meantime), the dialogues are cringe-worthy, whatever information needs to be delivered is dumped without much context, the kid's mother has no heart and doesn't really seem concerned for her son's well-being, she is actually doing Ember a favour of allowing him to help the boy and the way things developed is just why I tend to stay away from movie theatres for months in a row. Worst of all, something that could be incredibly original turned out to be a total rip off of a movie I watched many moons ago, right down to the way it ended. Except the other one took place in some woods, I think.*sigh*There were definitely interesting touches here and there like the detail of the watches stopping, the fact that Ember is in a wheelchair provided some exciting scenes, and even the ending, despite being a total rip-off, had a bittersweet tinge to it considering what Felix had told Ember. However, overall I cannot say Incarnate is worth watching.",negative
Incarnate,"I seem to be forced to write a review every now and then to counter the teens and 20 somethings that think they need to review every freaking thing in front of their heads. As an adult I can say comparatively speaking in regards to Exorcism, Possession, Evil doings and all things of the nether world this flick is worth the ticket. Aaron plays his role out fantastically (enough that I teared up at times) and until the end of the movie you will see the moments that hearken back to the decades previous releases but this one certainly offers a unique twist on the understanding of good vs. evil.I found myself nodding early on as a former Catholic and someone who just read way too much to keep believing in Santa Clause or religious super heroes I will say that I have plenty of room in my mind for universe yet untold that retains the secrets of untold, infinite galaxies (Hubble has scratched the surface and soon a new version of Hubble will be hurtling around the Earth).The cast is just fine and spot on with the sincerity in which they convey their emotional portrayals. I know full well there have been other releases over the last 7 years that fulfill most of the requirements of this genre but Incarnate has heart and an emotional connection I thought was somewhat left out or diminished in the other movies of this similar nature.As we hear Aaron's arch nemesis character say in the movie ""There are some things far worse than death""",positive
Wyrmwood: Road of the Dead,"WYRMWOOD is a high energy zombie flick from Australia that combines the road movie genre with a classic zombie apocalypse outbreak type horror yarn. It has a little of the verve of VERSUS but in the end I found it quite predictable and a little overwhelming.What's clear from the outset is that this is one step up from being an amateur film. The look of the zombies is cheap, especially with those Halloween party contact lenses, although there's copious gore to help make up for this. The acting is of a generally poor quality, but the film goes for a semi-serious approach so that doesn't matter too much.What WYRMWOOD does offer is action in spades. There's barely any plot, just a handful of characters battling both zombies and some sinister scientists bent on human experimentation. None of it made much sense to me, but the director works hard to infuse his film with vibrancy and momentum, and he does succeed in part.",negative
Wyrmwood: Road of the Dead,"Okay, maybe not THE BEST 90 minutes of my life, but it's definitely up there! I'm quite critical of movies and this movie didn't disappoint. This movie starts at 100 miles an hour right out of the gate. It's nail biting, exhilarating with enough humor to get your belly moving! You can tell they didn't have a big budget, but the camera work and pace of the film definitely makes up for it. Hats off to the Roach-Tuner brothers in their first feature film. Looking forward to part 2...?",positive
Infini,"I watched this movie after somebody said it's similar to Event Horizon. Is it? Well, it's in the same vein, using inter-dimensional travel to create the horror of ""unknown"".. but the ""horror"" isn't really that horrifying.Don't get me wrong, it's still far more competent and entertaining than the pile of sh*t that Prometheus and Alien: Covenant were. Just don't expect it to match Event Horizon.Primarily because, like with most directors/writers, in Infini, they make the mistake of trying to explain too much. Even bigger mistake is to show the enemy itself, but then it'd have to be a psychological horror, which this ain't.Also, I would've preferred they had ended the movie when the hero ""wakes up"" (not a spoiler) instead of them showing more. It'd left the ending up the interpretation, like they say they wanted to.. but I don't think it does. Kinda explains pretty clearly what happened and who changed and why. Kinda disappointed in that.Oh well, still a good movie. Worth watching.",negative
Infini,"I gave this two stars. One day this man that was in his second year studying Philosophy decided he wants to become a painter, but somehow manages to get into Film School instead. He's also slightly autistic. So yeah - he made a movie called ""Infini"". More than half of the movie I did not understand what they were talking about. Endless scenes that should't be there bored me to death. By the end of it I was getting restless and just wanted to gouge my eyes out already. There's something really wrong about this movie. I can't put my finger on it but I think the dialog is all messed up. Words keep coming out of the actor's mouth and they are not gibberish but by the end of the phrase you have absolutely no idea what has been said, what purpose does it serve or how exactly do those words help the viewer understand what is going on on the screen.",positive
Contracted,"As a big horror fan, particularly the body horror subgenre, I was excited to see this movie at Chicago International Film Festival. Unfortunately, it's so utterly, astonishingly preposterous that enjoyment was impossible. ""The Toxic Avenger"" is more plausible and well-reasoned than this.The main character almost immediately suffers a horrible symptom that would have any sensible woman dialing 911, but she opts to work a shift at a restaurant instead. I'll grant the filmmakers that maybe her disease is dialing up her stupidity, but 30 minutes in, her outward appearance is horrifying - the makeup effects are the sole redeeming element - and none of the other characters seem to notice, despite the fact that these same characters made a point to tell her how horrible she looked 10 minutes earlier, when she had no outwardly visible symptoms. Then again, a trip to the ER, rather than to a doctor whose STD exam doesn't require the patient to remove her jeans, would have ended the movie 15 minutes in.Worst of all, the director is too cowardly to really go for the gross- out, other than the opening shot and one well-executed shot near the midpoint. Every other opportunity to make the movie truly horrifying is fumbled. For example, the medical exam could've been a terrifying ""Dead Ringers""-esque nightmare, but instead it was just stultifying nonsense.I would like to say that it's so bad it's good, but it is most decidedly not. The ability to elicit laughter might have made it passable, but instead it only elicits groans. I'm happy that the filmmakers were able to sell this dreck to some apparently rohypnol-addled exec at IFC, but they've already been paid. There's no reason to feel obligated to spend money on this mess. It'll be streaming soon enough. Skip it, unless you want to spend an evening going, ""Seriously?!?"" and ""Really?!?"" for 85 minutes. If it's low-budget gynecological horror you want, rent ""Teeth"" instead. It's disgusting AND clever.",negative
Contracted,"I gave it a high score because I think it is a very well done movie, even with a few glitches but the acting and directing deserves a lot more recognition than what some people have said on here.Najarra is lovely to start with, her acting is very good and natural. This movie made me look her up on IMDb for her other work. Her acting was convincing, as a young lady who didn't get on with her mom and in a troubled relationship. Her process of transformation was also well done, from being confused and wanted to keep it to herself at the beginning, to losing hope and wanting to get back at people (good people albeit) around her.Some on here have complained about the doctor not saying much in the first diagnosis, but that is just normal. These days you go to a GP with a bleeding girlie part, chances are they'll tell you the same and observe for a few more days. Don't forget the events portrayed by the film were supposed to be over just a couple of days, a week at most. What struck me however is that the doctor should have referred to a specialist / ER after seeing her the second time, a change in the eye colour would definitely be some viral as he said it, a normal GP would not have discharged her without raising an alert. So that would probably be the biggest glitch in the movie's logic.Others have focused on how the film doesn't answer all questions, but why should it? This film was never intended to be a detective story, it merely shows the transformation. Who cares if we don't know more about the guy who gave her the disease, he did show up at the bar paying for her drink later on and leaving with another girl, that already answers the question. He is someone with a mission to spread this to girls, maybe a big pharma agent or CIA trying to test bio weapons, who knows and who cares anyway. Also some here were left wondering what happened to the guy who fancied her, why would the film have to explain something this obvious? She caught the virus, he's gonna catch it too and go through the same transformation then... you can't expect directors to spoon feed everyone. I think it is perfectly fine and in fact great that it does't then go on to explain, the movie ended where it needed to.All in all, it deserves at least a 6.5. Given that it is not an A list movie, I'd give it a 30% mark up. Name another B grade movie that's as well done I bet you cannot.",positive
Haunter,"I suffered through the 2nd and 3rd act of this film cause I'm kind of a buff, and I wanted to see where it ended up. The acting was okay. Abigail Breslin has a way to go to be good, but she's getting her chops. The other actors were average. The biggest problem with this film is it was supposed to be creepy, but never really achieves anything close to that. The story itself is so convoluted that about a third of the way through it was already boring me winding it's way to make a point showing the same plot development over and over like Ground Hog Day. This could almost be called ""Ghostbuster meets Groundhog, the Other Story,"" since it was trying so hard to be the movie, The Others, with Nicole Kidman, but that film was far, far superior to this entry. The whole narrative ends up some weirdly conceived (in a bad way) attempt to do something original with a ghost story. It wasn't a bad idea with the basic premise as discussed above (I didn't lay out the whole story obviously), so if you decide to take this one in. I would probably suggest skipping it for a better movie like The Others, The Six Sense, or even Ground Hog day if you want scarier for the first two, and funnier, if you pick the last if you haven't seen them.I think a 3 is pretty generous for this flick. The cinematography isn't too bad or the editing. Good luck if you watch it, and see if you don't agree with me.",negative
Haunter,"I honestly was skeptical when I first heard about this movie.As a lover of indie films,i assumed it would be very low budget and have a odd plot to it. I'm glad i decided to actually watch it.Haunter takes your typical ghost story and does a complete refreshing twist to it.I did get lost a few times,but quickly caught back up on what was going on.The acting was incredibly good for a indie film,and the story was super engaging.I was always on the edge of my chair the whole movie.I highly recommend everyone to at least rent this movie and give it a chance if you're a fan of the thriller genre.I really most certainly be checking out the directors other movies as well seeing how I loved splice as well.This guy is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors",positive
Witching and Bitching,"A stupid movie absolutely not funny.
Bad acting. For kids only.
Don't watch if you have a brain.
Nothing There.",negative
Witching and Bitching,"This fast paced, Spanish film is simultaneously a really disturbing horror tale, a meditation on the battle of the sexes, and one of the funniest movies I've seen in years. Things get off to a lightning start with a holdup of a gold buying emporium in downtown Madrid by criminals posing as living statues with a critical assist provided by a ten year old accomplice, one of the wildest film heist scenes I've ever seen and worth the price of admission alone. Seriously, you'll never forget the sight of a gold painted Jesus sprinting for his life while toting a little kid who's shooting back two handed at the police.A beginning like that would be hard to surpass, but W&B continues to pile it on under Alex de la Iglesia's masterful direction. Having commandeered a cab whose driver willingly agrees to assist them, the criminals try to flee north to France to escape the law and to fulfill the promise made by the leader, José (Hugo Silva), to take his son to Disneyworld in Paris, with the police and José's divorced wife in hot pursuit. Already a tense situation for the hapless thieves, things take a decided turn for the weird and the worse when they reach the witch infested town of Zugarramurdi, in the heart of Basque country. Led by a three generation family (the oldest witch reminded me of Grandmama from the Addams Family), the witches capture the thieves with malign designs upon them, namely to use the men as sacrifices to restore an oppressive matriarchy.The pace rarely lets up and the jokes fly fast and furious, interspersed with over the top, gross out scenes of gore. The men lament their inability to get along with women only to find themselves trapped in a decaying mansion (is there any other kind in a horror movie?) by a bunch of smiling, evil, literal witches who want to torture, kill, and eat them. They fight back as best they can, but their fates ultimately depend upon the attraction felt by the youngest witch in the family (well played by the stunningly beautiful Carolina Bang) for bumbling José. The climactic scene of a Witches' Sabbath simply has to be seen to be believed, but I won't give away any spoilers.About the only real criticism I have of this film is the English title, which I don't think accurately conveys what the film's about. The Spanish title, Las Brujas De Zugarramurdi, The Witches Of Zugarramurdi, was apparently a non-starter due to the long, difficult Basque place name. This minor cavil aside, this was a crackerjack movie, absolutely entertaining from start to finish.I recommend this film to horror fans who don't mind comedy mixed in with the scares (some horror fans are big purists that way) and anybody who likes a good laugh in general, although I will provide the trigger warning that this is not for anyone with a weak stomach.",positive
The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia,"Firstly, why this is called The Haunting in Connecticut 2 is a mystery as it has nothing whatsoever to do with the first movie.If you want a scary ghost story, steer well clear of this mess. A ghost pops up within about 2 mins of the opening and then throughout the entire film....constant....relentless flickering ghosts, shot for some reason in sepia. It wasn't enough to have one person who can see these ""ghosts"" either. No, we are treated to all three lead female characters having persistent visions for the entire 1hr 40mins. To claim this is based on a true story is almost insulting. To start with the ""true"" Wyrick story is a typical kid sees ghost affair, not particularly chilling (or true for that matter). By the end of this film it's nothing more than a ridiculous monster flick, with the character played by Abigail Spencer running and squealing around a standard creepy cellar filled with (shock horror) all manner of taxidermy and about 20 ghosts in tow.The concept of the underground slave railroad run by the evil taxidermist station master is a baffling plot line, which completely ruined the film. God knows what they were thinking.The acting from the little girl, Emily Alyn Lind is about the only redeeming feature. Chad Michael Murray was completely pointless, giving an unconvincing and lacklustre performance. The rest of the cast were okay, nothing spectacular, and of course 90% of the cast were mute ghostly types who just stand about in corners, looking over people's shoulders with a pained expression, and pointing into the woods.AVOID.",negative
The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia,"I didn't want to see this. I didn't care about it. My daughter wanted to see it and was afraid she would become scared so I watched it with her. I cannot believe how wrong I was. This movie was excellent. The premise is NOT silly, or stupid, and it is not scary or gory. What it is, is quite frightening and the story line is believable and this may be the one ""Based on a true story"" horror movie that actually is based on a true story. The story line is also very interesting and rich in actual history that my daughter enjoyed and so did I. I really can't even believe it was as good as it was. Unfortunately, the ONLY reason I gave it a 9 is the name is kinda dumb. My daughter was like A haunting in Connecticut 2: ghosts of Georgia...ummm why isn't it just named a haunting in Georgia or ghosts of Georgia...lol Please go see this and enjoy it.",positive
Extraterrestrial,"This teeters on the edge of being a comedic IKWYDLS slasher/horror movie (with aliens in it) as opposed to a full-fledged UFO shocker. It has that commercialized ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" vibe and (intentionally?) comes across as totally over-the-top and cliché. It kicks off in that overplayed fashion, with the auto-tuned emo rock band playing in the SUV, as the college students go on a weekend getaway to their rich parents' cottage. You begin to expect absolutely no character depth and no intelligent dialogue (which is the way the director wanted it I guess). It does unfold in a corny kind of way but it has elements of awesomeness in it. The timing of the jump scares is really good. The moments of alien contact are really cool-looking. Even though it has an almost comedic atmosphere, it still manages to be scary. This is a decent horror movie, with good jump scares....so check it out. If...you can get past the anal probe jokes and corny characters.",negative
Extraterrestrial,"I saw a lot of negative reviews for this movie, and I just don't get it. I found it far superior to the garbage that Hollywood typically churns out. On a minuscule budget, The Vicious Brothers truly have come through with a frightening and atmospheric sci-fi horror movie. Once the aliens start popping up, there is a true feeling of paranoia and desperation in that log cabin as everyone tries to survive the night. Excellent performances from all of the young leads and a truly daring ending make this a must see. I'll take this movie over Sinister, A Haunting in Connecticut, etc. any day. I want to see more from these directors.....",positive
The Town That Dreaded Sundown,"I had assumed that The Town That Dreaded Sundown 2014 was simply a remake of the 1976 slasher of the same name; this, I am glad to say, is not the case—it's a bit cleverer than that.The film is set in the small town of Texarkana, where a masked psycho known as The Phantom committed a series of vicious murders 65 years earlier—it is these killings that provided the inspiration for the original movie, which—in this film—is now a cult favourite amongst the town's teenagers. It is during a screening of the film that young couple Jami (Addison Timlin) and Corey are attacked by someone dressed as the Phantom. Corey (Spencer Treat Clark) is repeatedly stabbed in the back, but Jami manages to escape to tell the tale.Over the next few days, The Phantom claims several more victims; meanwhile, Jami investigates the history of the original murders (with help from archivist Nick, played by Travis Tope) in the hope of shining some light on the identity of the current killer.A little bit meta, this plot is intriguing enough to help distinguish it from all of the other remakes/re-imaginings/sequels that have plagued the horror genre in recent years, but the film also delivers the basics—scares, gore and nudity—making it a fun way to spend an hour and a half. The scares are sparing, but well executed; the death scenes are sufficiently nasty, with some nice and bloody effects, including the surprisingly graphic sight of a major character cut into several pieces; unfortunately, despite having a sex scene, star Timlin fails to flash the goods, leaving it to a blonde bimbo to do the honours during a motel romp.The final act, which relies on a very improbable twist, is something of a disappointment given all that has gone before, but overall I had a good time with this film. Time to revisit the original, methinks",negative
The Town That Dreaded Sundown,"Hate to tell the truth but whether or not you personally ""liked"" a film does not necessarily qualify you to review it.This reviewer was hosting horror festivals when the original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD came out, and the hardest thing to do in a horror flick is be subtle.But this director has mad skills. And can do subtle.The framing in many of the scenes is incredible, there are times you almost feel the characters on-screen are the only people left on the face of the earth.And Gomez-Rejon also is shrewd enough to get more mileage out of Addison Timlin's face than a Prius.And a nice face it is. I counted over 50 closeups and then stopped counting. Her character is the glue, the connection, for this story and she is set up as a shy girl who (quote) never gets asked out.Which is why this story is fiction and not a documentary.And you the viewer get to watch the whole story through her eyes.The juxtaposition of the new movie and the ""old movie"" only makes my point -- putting this film alongside Whedon's Cabin in the Woods for cleverly deconstructing a tale from within the story arc itself.",positive
The Eyes of My Mother,"Incredibly well-made. Created with a confidence and assurance of the material, I was shocked to learn that it was from a first time director and writer. Saying that, I don't think the film goes as far as it needs to. I do feel like its very short running time is felt. It's not always the easiest film to watch, it's quite disturbing in a frighteningly quiet way. It's beautifully filmed and directed, with a stunning lead performance at its core. I'll see how it fares with me over time but as of now I like it quite a bit. 2016 has been a great year for horror and this only continues that tradition. I definitely recommend this for horror fans that want intelligence in their films.",negative
The Eyes of My Mother,"Spellbinding tale of an unwell, isolated young woman who has no idea that she's unwell. Just a mesmerizing performance by Kika Magalhães in the lead, and shot in exquisite black and white. It's a very dark, off-putting movie, and it's definitely not for everyone. Director Nicolas Pesce makes great use of the film's short running time (under 80 minutes) and relatively claustrophobic atmosphere. VERY well done.",positive
Resident Evil: Vendetta,"Boring, predictable, shallow, over the top, ridiculous. The worst animated movie of the series, as bad as Anderson's movies. The only good thing is the impressive CGI, animations and details are really incredible. The rest is totally pointless. Basic plot line, one dimensional characters, absurd and not realistic situations. Plot is the same story told over and over again over the games: new villain spreads a virus, heroes fight zombies, heroes fight a final boss and save the city. There is absolutely no twist or a new focus on story that could make it more interesting.Only recommended for Resident Evil hardcore fans, casual viewers be warned: this is a total waste of time.",negative
Resident Evil: Vendetta,"I went to the one night only premiere of Resident Evil: Vendetta tonight the third C.G.I. motion picture movie of Resident Evil and I can honestly say is the best of the three.The movie deliver in more ways than one that fans of the Resident Evil series will super appreciate.First off we got to talk about how amazing the movie looks this is some of the most Phenomenal animation works I ever saw the characters and environments are so realistic that you can often forget that you're watching a Computer Generated Animated Movie the movie crew hired actors for motion capture to show case how real the characters look and move on screen they all deserve points for doing such a great job to make the movie look so great.The voice acting is top notch with in my opinion the voice work and characters Chris Redfield (Voiced by Kevin Dorman) Rebecca Chambers (Voiced by Erin Cahill) Leon S.Kennedy (Voiced by Matthew Mercer) Glenn Arias (Voiced by John DeMita)bringing great performances that really shows amazing work it makes you feel like you really watching a drama play done so well the voice work the cast does is so well done with the writing being very smart the writers took their time that's for sure.The story really is powerful throughout with the writing again being well through out. The cast performances also helps the story makes you draw into the plot to wonder what will happen next.The action in the movie is awesome it felt like you're playing the game and the effects are impressive barely enough time to rest as the action keeps you on the edge of your seat as you wait to see what goes on next.The only thing this movie needs is a mic drop because it really show why Resident Evil has had such a success the movie is made for fans of movies and Resident Evil. I will no doubt be glad to watch this movie over and over again.With amazing C.G.I Animation,Excellent Voice acting, Strong powerful story and action that leaves your jaw drop you really will love this movie.I give Resident Evil: Vendetta an 10 out of 10",positive
I Am Not a Serial Killer,"I never review any films but I felt compelled to after having watched this absolute trash. I honestly have no idea why it has so many good reviews, this film is so inconsistent. The main character is diagnosed as being a sociopath yet he cares for everyone?!?! 90% of the film is filler, none of the scenes push the story forward, a plot didn't seem to exist. An hour into the film I checked to see how long it had been on for, I was gobsmacked it had only been on for 60 minutes, It felt like days had passed. The film was slow and cumbersome, the dialogue was ineffective and didn't contribute to the story line most of the time. I won't put any spoilers in, the main spoiler of the film is the fact it has spoilt my Sunday afternoon, I'm hungover and now I'm angry too. Please don't watch this film, you will just end up like me, bitter, twisted and disappointed.",negative

I also recommend ""Night of the Living Deb"" a comedy/zombie indie.Guide: No swearing that I recall. No sex or nudity.",positive
The Vatican Tapes,"You immediately question the direction of the movie because of it's focus on surveillance footage only to have no real purpose of the footage. The camera work is terrible. The main character's hair, why is it always side parted and perfect? The entire theater booed when it ended. Too many plain plots. The music score is cheap. Too many scenes of the Vatican for no reason. The use of an actor from 90210 only makes movies less believable. The casting director should be fired and never work in Hollywood. Props to the CGI people for doing what they could with this baddie. They all need acting coaches. This movie probably was very fun and funny to film. I never write reviews. Wrote this one because I became so frustrating with this movie. It has no integrity and no body. Very empty. Should have gone straight to VHS, not even DVD or netflix.",negative

Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead,"This movie is (like part 1 before) really something else. Goofy, gory, funny, disgusting, ""politically incorrect"" slaughterhouse with excellent FX and a touch of Monty Python. Absurd at its best. Obviously, this could be filmed only in Europe (despite some American actors), in a country an abundance of sense of humor (like Norway in this case). This is also a rare occasion where the sequel is even better than the first part (and leaves room for more; looking forward to it). I mean, zombie movie cannot be fun if it is not really funny and entertaining (both for crew involved and the viewers). The director knows very well that the whole ""zombie thing"" is ridiculous and absurd in itself and takes such approach. No one should take this seriously (simply disregard ""historic"" part) and it does not insult viewers' intelligence. Just enjoy. Of course, if you missed part 1, don't miss it. Watch both one after another. Highly recommended.",negative
Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead,"Everything in zombie movies has been done to death (see what I did there?). And yet, here comes a movie that actually adds to the genre whilst simultaneously disgusting me and making me belly laugh. And not one of those infectious belly laughs. You know, when you are in a theatre and something mildly amusing on-screen sends a ripple through the crowd which grows; mostly because the girl down the front has a weird cackling laugh that morphs into a full-on snort fest, and that just sets everyone else off. Yeah, well, it's not like that.I was on my own. And I laughed out loud multiple times. I genuinely LOLed. That's as rare as rocking horse faeces. Dead Snow 1 was a revelation; a brilliant twist on the genre. Dead Snow 2 adds again. The comedy elements are ratcheted up as is the budget. A budget wisely spent on special effects and sheer scale. If you are after genuine chills and insights into the human condition, Dead Snow 2 will leave you cold (see what I did there too?). But if your appetite runs to comedic gore in the vein of Peter Jackson's 'Brain Dead', you will love this one.",positive
Emelie,"It seems these days all I do is write reviews trashing movies. If a movie is good, then great, no need to come here and try and help my fellow users warning them to avoid it like the plague.But in the case of the truly terrible movies which somehow have decent enough reviews and ratings to sucker me in, that I then watch and wish I could get the 2 hours of my life back I feel COMPELLED to come here and give them bad reviews in the hope of convincing others NOT to waste their time.So on to the the movie, with a couple of spoilers (if indeed it is even possible to spoil something with no twists, turns or tension): Good horror needs somewhat realistic situations, with people doing somewhat realistic things, that we would all do (which then fail, or are thwarted by the villain). Think Nightmare on Elm St from the 1980s. OK the whole thing takes place in a dream, with a long dead killer stalling the kids through their nightmares.This is utterly unbelievable, but the characters try and survive and battle Freddy in a realistic way. And the more he outsmarts them or the worse things get the more the terror mounts.SPOILER: None of that happens here. Why does this psycho baby sitter go to all this trouble, when she could have just snatched the kid in the first 2 minutes? She's all busy trying to drug the kids, and playing creepy games with them...WHY? There's no logic or tension at all.She has a male henchman, who is desperate to be part of her plan, and while he's out stalking the parents so they don't come home from their date unexpectedly she phones him and says ""I need more time"".For what?? JUST RUN with the kid! What on earth is this plotting? She gets access to the house and then just hangs out rather than just bolting out of there with the kid she wants under her arm.This idiot then decides that to give her 'more time' he won't drive as fast as possible back to the house so he can grab her and flee with the stolen kid. Oh no, this guy decides he will *ram his car into the parents as they drive home from their date and die in the ensuing crash*.Huh? Worst plotting ever. There is no logic, no fear, no real edge of your seat nail biting terror. This movie is a long sequence of the supposed really smart killer babysitter making the absolute worst possible decisions about how to steal the child she is obsessed with because (spoiler alert): She lost her own child previously. Damn, just grab the kid, jump into your weirdo male accomplice's car and get the hell out of there...Which is what I advise you to do rather than watch this trash - get the hell out of there!SKIP this movie.It's also a far too big a role for the lead actress Sarah Bolger, who is cute and very girl next door - she reminds you of about a dozen other young actresses in this mold, nothing unique about her and you could have slotted pretty much an other actress into this role. Sadly she cannot carry a movie, especially not one as poorly written as this. This is made even more noticeable as the three young kids run rings around her for acting and commitment to the role. They are all great.Script: 2/10 Acting: 4/10 Thrills: 1/10 Desire to smack the scriptwriters right in the face for the absence of fear and tension in a thriller? Oh that's 10/10 for sure.",negative
Emelie,"So many disturbing situations in this film. Whenever you mix kids into a movie, it can either get creepy (Children of the Corn), or you feel really bad for the manipulated children, which was the case for this film.Sarah Bolger does an excellent job going from nice girl next door to psycho babysitter. And all the kids do a great job too, especially Thomas Bair, who plays the littlest brother, Christopher. I wouldn't classify this one as horror, but more as a psychological thriller. Although it didn't have a lot of tension, I still was transfixed, waiting to see what fresh hell Emelie would do to the children next. I really enjoyed it, and would have given it five stars, but there were some holes in the plot that were pretty big (especially towards the end), and a couple of things that weren't really explained.There are scenes that involve sexual situations with the children, that may really be a trigger for some folks. If this is you, you may want to skip this one. But otherwise, I say give this one a watch.",positive
Extinction,"The zombie genre has been bled dry, nothing new there; there is literally nothing new anyone can eke anymore out of it to make another great zombie flick. I certainly haven't seen a good zombie flick in over a decade. Instead of being creative by coming up with new creepy concepts, the vast majority of ""film-makers"" are content to milk the last molecules out of zombie and vampire genres. Only two adults (at the outset) are left in the world – yet they don't talk. That's a whole new level of dumb they're trying to sell, just so they can do injustice to that overrated movie term called ""dramatic conflict"". The notion that these two guys won't talk due to something that occurred eons ago, regarding some floozy from years back, is too stupid. It just doesn't wash. No matter what argument or hatred is going on between grown men, an extraordinary situation such as a zombapocalypse should have brought them together, at least to the point where they can talk and grudgingly co-operate. Beggars can't be choosers, yet the writer thinks they can. People forgive each other under much less stressful conditions, when they don't have to, let alone in an unpopulated, frozen wasteland in which co-operation is essential to survival.What's with this ""double whammy"" apocalypse anyway? We've got a zombapocalypse AND a new ice age! I'd be curious to know WHY a zombie virus would cause such a radical shift in global temperature. Any explanations, movie? No explanation. Movie refuses to discuss this matter with me. Movie knows it's wrong. Movie is a dummie. If anything, there should be global warming, not an ice age. Here's why: since zombies eat much more than humans (bless their wicked metabolism) – and yet remain skinny – this means they must do the brownie much more often than humans. The logical conclusion is that they fart more – which in turn would make the planet warmer, not colder. Am I right or am I right?Nor can I accept the fact that TWO major events occur at the SAME day, after nine years of relative monotony: first the hippie gets attacked by a new breed of zombie, only to be contacted by radio minutes later - for the FIRST TIME in nine years – by another survivor. That's coincidenceitatis being brought to a level of absurdity that's an insult to viewers, even zombie viewers many of whom are not unlike the movie's zombies themselves.It gets better. The little girl, who had been obedient for so many years, not leaving the grounds as ordered, suddenly decided it was OK to go for a NIGHT stroll – only a day after seeing a zombie for the first time! So let me get this right, movie: BEFORE seeing any ""live"" zombies, the girl didn't have that much interest in venturing outside, but as soon as she witnessed a zombie attack her neighbour, she somehow found that ENCOURAGING? ""Hmmm, I used to think it wasn't safe leaving the house, but now that I've seen an alien-looking, deformed, vicious zombie with huge teeth attack another human right in front of my eyes – to which I reacted with shock, dismay and disgust - now I guess it's OK to go out. It's much safer out there with a zombie on the loose."" Great logic, movie. Are we to believe all 9 year-olds are completely retarded, devoid of even the most basic survival instincts?Still, at least she isn't dumb enough to have herself locked up in a basement; but that's precisely what her guardian does. There's hardly an experienced film fan that didn't see THAT stupid plot-device leading to the girl's endangerment.Just exactly who or what threatens our less-than-merry bunch? A bunch of freakin' gollums, that's what. In recent years a dull fad has engulfed the world of horror flicks, a fad that is making many of them a lot less interesting: the gollum trend. We've seen gollum-like monsters in the overrated ""Descent"", we've seen them in ""The Hallow"", in ""From the Dark"", and many other recent monster movies. Must we have the SAME kind of monsters in every film?Besides, if these zombie gollums evolved during the new ice age, shouldn't they have grown fur at least? No: the movie thinks it makes more sense to make them totally hairless! Now, that's a logical evolution right there. Darwin would be laughing his ass off. Clearly, American screenwriters have devolved to the state of an amoeba, because so few of them think anymore. Horror, fantasy, and sci-fi films are getting dumber with every new generation of devolved film-makers.It mystifies me why the survivors have to resort to hand-to-hand combat with the gollums when they'd previously armed themselves to the hilt. And when they do finally get to shoot the gollums, they run out of ammo! I mean, here we have a world in which time is the one commodity the humans have in abundance, yet they never actually bothered to make sure they have sufficient supplies of ammunition. This is the kind of nonsense I'm talking about, a clear indicator that screenwriters have devolved from average morons who made average movies in the 40s and 50s to the sub-par imbeciles who never run through a script more than 2-3 times before submitting it to some daft director.",negative
Extinction,"This movie could have been so much more. it had all the elements to end up a masterpiece, but for whatever reasons the actions seem incomplete. The potential in this movie was beyond awesome, unfortunately they only scratched the surface.The beginning of the movie wasn't all that promising but once I had a view at the first snow creature I was amazed how well it looked.. from afar. Once they got close, it lost all the fear that got me excited at first. I'm not saying they did a bad job, but the effects and costumes felt outdated and unpolished.The acting was above average, even though some character decisions were sloppy here and there, never the less the movie did connect with the human touch after 9 years of survival in the wilderness with 2 men and a child.The plot is unique and original but a bit rushed, maybe too many elements were included and there wasn't enough time to explore them in depth and evolve a better bond between them. One solid example would be the radio voices that were suggesting dementia, but they were there only for a few minutes in the movie then they weren't mentioned at all.The movie is worth watching, even though the ending was kind of messy with little information what was going on. Maybe one day someone will try to remake it into something better and add more refined details that were skipped or rushed in this movie.",positive
Borgman,"I'm still not quite sure what the film is trying to say, what it is about, it does seem like it is saying something, but in a way that is only logical within the film itself. If that makes any sense. It's a dark film about some people taking over some other people without getting to know why. It all happens in a designer house and a large garden surrounded by nature, forest. The further you go along in this puzzle (which tends to be quite slow in the first half and more paced in the second half), the more you understand what's going on but only cause you see a plan being revealed but still not knowing really what the goal is, or the meaning. It never get's explained fully but this tension is what keeps you watching it. At times brutal, funny and reflective upon society towards certain members who are let's say, not so fortunate vs the fortunate. In a way, it's payback time to those who have it all and don't know what they've got. Not sure that covers it all. At the end of the film I did feel a sense of conclusion and awe of it all, not knowing exactly what I just saw, just knowing I liked being played for the duration of this work. Would like to see it again.",negative
Borgman,"One of the best films of the Philadelphia Film Festival, Borgman is a hilarious, darkly satirical, mysterious, sexy, fascinating, and surreal allegory for social upheaval.In the beginning, there was armed men looking to kill underground hobos. We will never find out why they want to kill them or why the hobos are underground (or why the hobos have nice cellphones). One of them, Camiel Borgman, escapes and warns his friends. He washes himself at a gas station and begins wandering down an extremely affluent street with the intention of getting a proper bath in one of them, simply by asking at the front door. One house in particular strikes his fancy, and he begins a slow process of worming his way into the household and the lives of everyone who lives there.But that's when things get REALLY strange.This film is destined for hopefully a good deal of international attention in the art-house circuit due to its exceptional storytelling, unpredictability and very weird plot.With the matter-of-fact way it presents absurd goings-on, it reminded me of Dogtooth a little.",positive
The Other Side of the Door,"I saw this movie at 10:20AM on Saturday, in a completely big empty theater with my party of three (including myself). Now, when I saw the preview for the film, I was very intrigued. I wanted to know what happened, so I was shocked when one of my main movie theaters was playing it but then yet again, it's an indie theater. Now the whole set design of this film, was great. I thought it was something new to set it in India and it's a original idea. They actually payed respect to the culture. Now some of the jumpscares were annoying, but only some. They had great effects though for the 'gatekeeper', no CGI actual makeup. The performances were solid, the little girl wasn't atrocious, but she fitted her character well, nothing great, it's like she-just- acts-for-that-scene. Sarah Wayne Callies was much better than she needed to be, Jeremy Sisto was sort of just there, but he did well. The director tried to take this new approach to the film, which worked most of the time. It has old-classic scares like piano playing by itself, chairs moving, books falling, etc. Not really any new scares. This isn't the must see horror film of the year, but it's a solid watch with a very clever ending.",negative
The Other Side of the Door,i didn't have any expectations for this movie but wow this was complete and utter garbagethere is absolutely nothing good about this moviethe scares are predictable and cheap the mother character is the worst the daughter has the worst actor the setting did nothing to establish the folklore or story the ending was stupid the decisions were stupid the characters are stupidi just don't know what to say other than just say that everything about this movie is badi mean the mom was told to not open the door under any circumstances and what does she do? she just opens the cockadoodie doori genuinely hate this movie this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen,positive
The Gallows,"Do not, I repeat, Do not fall for the made up 10 star reviews...( It's obvious those affiliated with producing this garbage want to pique the interest of others so they give fake ratings & reviews, hoping others will be interested enough to see it- & they make more $$) Take it from me, Wasting my $ & time on this terrible so-called ""movie"" left me leaving the theater very upset I wasted $ on this trash & annoyed. All found myself wanting to do, was to drop-kick the blonde, camera-holding, guy. (.Whoever decided THAT guy has any talent in acting, needs to have their heads examined.,I can only surmise he has a family connection or paid to be in the film) The story/ acting was way too cheesy to be scary. I have nothing positive to say about this film. It was just plain junk. When I went to see it, it was opening weekend, therefore, there weren't many reviews or ratings accumulated to get a real idea of whether or not it was going to be any good. I believe this crap actually had a 6.1 rating...Now, for horror movies- I considered that to be relatively high ( even from just a couple hundred ratings) Wow, was I duped!! Now,after seeing ( most of ) the movie ( ended up walking out, it was THAT BAD) and then seeing the 10 star reviews, I KNOW the ratings on here can't be trusted...( until you see at least 5,000 - 10,000 people rated it) SO- save your $ , time & irritation -skip this boring, sad excuse & find something better...",negative
The Gallows,"I remeber when I first saw the trailer for this movie, and it scared the hell out of me. When it came out on iTunes (the most convenient place for me to watch it), I immediately rented it without reading the reviews. I loved it. I consider myself a horror movie buff. I'm so desensitized to horror movies that I fell asleep during The Exorcist. However it took me hours to fall asleep after The Gallows. The ""villain"" was depraved, yet relatable, the scares happened when you least expect them to, and the setting was perfect.
The next day, I went to IMDB to review it, and was horrified to see the reviews. People have trashed this movie for no reason. Maybe they just don't come in contact with modern high school students, because the actors pulled off their roles marvelously.",positive
Batman: Gotham by Gaslight,"Batman Gotham by gaslight I believe is based off a comic. I can't remember much of the interview so do bare with me.I am sorry but I am just not impressed with the movie at all. The whole story was predictable over who was behind the murders of those women that got killed by Jack the Ripper. I will give it some credit since the animation is good quality and the voice cast was really good. Especially since it was nice hearing Bruce Greenwood voice Batman again and I am looking forward to hearing him again in season 3 of Young Justice. Well at least we never had weird shippings like Batman and Batgirl/Nightwing and Harley Quinn seriously? God knows what was Timm thinking when he was making those movie. Now this? Even though Justice League Gods and monsters chronicles was messed up and nearly killed the DC Universe at least the movie made up for it (see my reviews). This on the other hand is just student work i mean seriously: Jim Gordon is the ripper?, Tim, Dick and Jason are orphans running the on the streets and are raised by some mugger to steel?, Barbra Gordon is a psychopath?,I could go on and on but I am going to end my review here.",negative
Batman: Gotham by Gaslight,"Decent story; pathetic, ultra-cheap, non-animation! It looks like they had told the basic story line to a bunch of completely talentless 5th-graders and told them to ""take some hard-lead ugly-colored pencils and draw us some pictures of this story.""",positive
The Good Neighbor,"""The Good Neighbor"" follows the antics of 2 teenage boys (Ethan and Sean) 'haunting' and surveilling an old man (Harold Grainey) that they dislike, all in the name of conducting a 'sociological experiment', in the hopes of generating a million views on youtube. Eventually, we learn that this just isn't some innocent experiment, and the old man isn't what they thought he was.The movie opens with a narration of how perception isn't always reality, and that people see only what they want to see. And this is really what this movie is about. The old man that everybody views as despicable and hateful is really just an old man that's hurting from the loss of his wife and wants to be left alone. While the old man's strange behavior may seem psychotic to others, especially to the two voyeur teenagers, in reality it's just the actions of an old man trying to deal with pain and reacting to the paranormal activity, in his own self-destructive way of course. It's an interesting lesson of how outside influences, regardless of how innocent, can have an enormously unpredictable outcome.However, the antics of these kids isn't so innocent, most especially are the motives of Ethan. He keeps trying to push the old man, even when confronted and challenged by his partner in crime. We soon learn that this 'experiment' has as much to do with revenge as it does a study in human behavior. We learn that there is a history between Ethan's family and Mr. Grainey (very appropriately named I might add), and Ethan's bias toward the old man only fuels his speculation that he is up to no good. Ultimately, Mr. Grainey pays the ultimate price as a result of the actions of the two juvenile delinquents.I generally found this movie kind of hard to watch because the characters were so unlikable. Ethan, the true villain in this movie, I found to be truly despicable. His cohort Sean has a conscience but isn't able to think on his own and is compelled to be around Ethan because of his own insecurities and social awkwardness. Ethan's mother is so wrapped up in her own world that she basically lets Ethan do whatever he wants. And Mr. Grainey, for better or worse, was made out to be so horrible by the narrative that even when we learn that he's a lonely, albeit mean, old man that garners sympathy, it's hard to put aside the initial feelings about him and his overall bad traits.However, the climax with Ethan hiding in the house with his gun drawn and Mr. Grainey standing in the same room with his gun drawn is truly a gripping scene, and basically saves the movie from being a total disaster. And it serves as a reminder to us all that we all live in our own perceptions of reality.",negative

The best movie in that genre still remains Braindead, and of course the Evil Dead movies, but this one I will remember as well. The exaggeration in the gory details is what makes it funny. The amount of slashed body parts and the inventive ways they use to do it is just hilarious. The script might not be the best ever but that's not what it is about with a movie like Deathgasm. It's just a bit fun. Fun for people like me that get that kind of humor. Some others will probably hate that movie and that's okay.

12 Feet Deep,"A ok movie with a low budget shot with in 14 days totally deserve a watch with the budget, you should accept what u will get. Whats the message every movie has its own message they blended some life problems with the plot yea it shows us when humans goes through their hardest situations they do whatever they can even if they dont like each other they dont got a choice they work together, they confess to each other what wrong things they have done, when they survive situations they treat each other with love after they went through things and feel more than before for each other, the main idea was getting a lesson from wrong doing things and making humans change. the acting performance was perfect and everything else. You get drama and thriller moments. But didnt feel the characters much and didnt feel much thriller. 6/10⭐",negative
12 Feet Deep,"""12 Feet Deep: Two Sisters Trapped"" displays an emotional depth and creativity rarely seen in a film. Much like the old saying, ""he has more talent in his little finger than you do in your whole body"", Matt Eskandari does more within the confines of a single olympic sized swimming pool than most writer/directors can achieve crossing oceans. Both physically and existentially trapped, the two sisters are seemingly drawn into this nightmare by cosmic forces--made to endure this hardship together to work out their demons.And just when you're settling in to the Sorkin-esque dialogue, the natural back and forth that turns into haunting soliloquy at the drop of a hat, a third character is introduced.SPOILERS AHEADThe girls finally think they've found their saving grace when the janitor--Clara--enters the pool to clean. However, soon enough the pair realize that the down on her luck janitor isn't so keen to see them freed before getting something out of the deal. The last 40 minutes are a taut and masterfully woven journey wherein the downtrodden Clara grapples with the unfairness of the world while delivering some unfairness of her own. The three tussle back and forth before a crisis of conscious urges Clara to free them--only for her to find that she cannot draw back the pool cover and rescue the girls.
I won't say any more, because I would not want to deprive the audience of what some may soon consider the most edge-of-your-seat, nail-biting, anxiety inducing ends to a movie in some time. As my friend and I watched the final twenty minutes of the film, we both rejoiced and cursed ""ESKANDARI"" for the way he played with our emotions in those final moments.Sorkin meets Kubrick meets Spielberg meets Perry. Someday Eskandari will be a household name that other viewers will curse and praise in equal measure. All I can say for now is, I'll have trouble sleeping tonight pondering the bigger question of 12 Feet Deep, and coming down from the exhilaration I felt watching this movie.",positive
A Field in England,"After three remarkable contemporary black comedies Ben Wheatley has now all but reinvented the British historical picture with ""A Field in England"". Set during the English Civil War and filmed in black and white this is as far removed from the likes of ""Cromwell"" or such stately Oscar-grabbers as ""A Man for all Seasons"" or ""Anne of the 1000 Days"" as it's possible to get. But then nothing Wheatley has done to date has been conventional.In ""Down Terrace"" an average British family of petty criminals set about slaughtering each other. In ""Kill List"", two hit-men find themselves in 'Wicker Man' territory while in ""Sightseers"" a Mike Leighish couple on a camping holiday turn into Bonnie and Clyde. Consequently, ""A Field in England"" turns out to be, not so much a film about the Civil War at all, but another variation on Wheately's theme of subverting genre norms.The deserters who find themselves traversing not one but many fields in England are even from the same side but are simply thrown together after a battle while what happens to them bears no resemblance to what happens to 'soldiers', (I use the term loosely), in other pictures. This is quirky, original and quite unlike anything else. It certainly won't be to everyone's taste, particularly if you like your narratives straightforward but it confirms Wheatley as one of the most innovative directors working in cinema today.",negative
A Field in England,"This came with a fair bit of hype being directed by Ben Wheatley who made KILL LIST that gained a cult following and due to being released on multiple platforms ie released at selected cinemas , Blue-ray , DVD and broadcast on Film4 all on the same day . With hindsight the people who didn't pay to watch this film are luckier than the ones who did and anyone who hasn't seen this pretentious pile of horse manure is luckier than anyone who has Critics who saw preview copies of FIELD were very vague about the plot . That is because the film has no plot . Some deserters from the English Civil War team up , walk through some fields , take magic mushrooms and shoot each other . Anyone expecting something along the lines of WITCHFINDER GENERAL will be disappointed because this is like a bad episode of Monty Python without the surreal jokes crossed with Tarkovsky It's a case of style over substance , not so much substance abuse but plenty of style abuse . Wheatley realises there's no story to the screenplay so wastes his celluloid and the audiences time by showing off every directorial technique he learned at film school . If he's trying to emulate the brooding atmosphere of Nicolas Winding Refn's VALHALLA RISING then he's failed because this is Valhalla sinking . Sinking in to a big cesspit filled with pretentious poo The critics who did see it before the general public did lavish praise upon it and is a classic example that the emperor is naked . It is a film of incomprehensible storytelling that has no plot and makes very little sense . If it was made by a bunch of film students it wouldn't receive a distributor and the only reason it received any type of publicity is because it was directed by the fashionable and overrated Ben Wheatley and the multi platform release .

[REC] 4: Apocalypse,"I have never really loved mainstream Hollywood horror movies, and REC's first installment is one of my favorites. While the first film (c. 2007) of the franchise is arguably the best, there is a real debate about the third one, which talks altogether about something else. But, in here, the director-actress duo have successfully closed a good franchise by continuing stories from the second and third films.We are now in a quarantined ship where doctors are researching on a serum that will serve as an antidote to the parasite and its bacteria. Our reporter friend, two Military soldiers, doctors, and the ship's crew fret it out in a ""survival of the fittest"" kinda situation as the subject of the research runs amok. As a zombie apocalypse ensues, alas! without the found footage element, but with security surveillance element, we find out that the truth is not what it seemed to be. And there is more to what happened at the end of installment two.Although the film starts pretty slowly, it becomes spot on after thirty or so minutes. Lots of unwanted blood baths and absurd dialogs may keep you from continuing, but if you are brave enough and forgo these horror film requisites, REC 4 will turn out to be real entertainment. The dark setting helps as the franchise probably ends here.BOTTOM LINE: If you have been following the franchise, this will make an amazing watch with friends and family. Happy New Year 2015!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOFore/Violence: Infinity",negative
[REC] 4: Apocalypse,"Looking forward to see REC 4 ones it was over I was left with mixed emotions. The unique story of REC was gone. By now you do know how the zombies or infected do look and move and the surprises seen in part 1 and 2 are gone. It's of course normal that by part 4 you have seen it all before but even as it has a few intense moments it's the use of lighting and the shots that made it hard to sit through.It starts off rather well because we go back to the apartment were Ángela Vidal (Manuela Velasco) was taken by the infested and disappeared at the end of part 1. They do rescue her not without a few attacks by the way. She's been taken to a cargo on the ocean were they are doing experiments on her and the soldiers who has taken her out of the apartment. It's even funny when suddenly an old lady comes across the story who is asking were the honeymoon takes place, a wink to REC 2. But by then the story weakens a bit because once you see the lab you know what is going to happen. When an experiment goes wrong an infected monkey breaks out of it's cage and spreads the disease. But what could have been a surprising reprise turned into an annoying experience. Lights do flash a lot and the camera moves a lot and is zoomed in for most of the time so it's a on and off of seeing what is going on. The reason is rather simple, the surprise of REC couldn't be done again. It even reminded me a lot of Alien (1979) because Angela becomes the hero and walks around in her undershirt a lot so Ripley isn't that far away. There's a bit of explanation what makes the virus and the end is open so it's off to REC 5 I guess. But I hope that the suspense and the creepy look of the infected like in REC is back there. Don't get me wrong. It isn't that bad after all but due the use of zoomed in shaky camera shots it didn't infected me .Gore 2/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",positive
Open Grave,"Oh dear. What have we here? I'm sure like most people, you came to this movie via the pretty good looking trailer. That guy caught on the barbed wire fence, the video monitors of people in cages, that big pit full of bodies, man it looked like it was going to be fantastic. Sadly though, that's the ""grave"" error I made too. To find a horror movie with an actor who's just been in Elysium, and earlier in the brilliant District9, I thought I was onto a winner here, but the acting? It's absolutely atrocious. Fake accents, and dialogue straight out of Scooby Doo. Dreadful, simply dreadful. You can almost smell the cheese on it.The premise was quite good, and I won't spoil it for you in case you manage to get to the end. But the cast simply ruined it for me. And the storyline is pretty convoluted as well. From the offset when a group of strangers wake up in a room (where have we seen that a million times before?) not knowing how they got there or who they are, it descends into a mess of a film. Towards the end it picks up slightly, but by then you've basically just given up on it. Very disappointing, really disappointing, I had high hopes for this one and it threw me into an open grave.",negative
Open Grave,"I went into this movie mostly blind, having only read a short summary 30 minutes before seeing it. The summary does not do this film any justice. I expected a quick horror slasher, that I could enjoy for 90 minutes and immediately forget about. What I got was a brilliantly shot, beautifully scored, and engrossing mystery/horror thriller that I will never forget. It relieves me to know that there is still some creativity and originality in horror movies, especially in this day and age. While the ideas and concepts in Open Grave have been done to death, it brings new light to a certain horror genre we are all probably getting sick of and uses them perfectly. A few horror clichés are still there that I am frankly growing tired of, but not enough that it hurts the film.The cinematography was top notch for a horror film. The casting was also well done. Sharlto Copley does a fantastic job as the lead, even with his real South African accent trying ever so hard to bleed through his fake American one. Also anything with Thomas Kretschmann in it is always worth a watch. In conclusion, if you are at all a horror fan like me, you must give this film a go. I think you will enjoy it.",positive
Honeymoon,"Do not judge this film on its first 15 minutes. Let it simmer.Excellently crafted thriller-turned-horror.

Honeymoon,"I've never really experienced sitting through a film after figuring out the 'twist' LLOONNGG before our central character has. Pretty boring, isn't it? And, as our intrepid 'hero' finds mounting evidence that the girl he just married is not the person she once was after a little naked sleepwalk before dawn, I found myself utterly indifferent to their fates. The plot moves as if it was stuck in quick drying cement, and having already worked out most of the final details as to what was going on, there was little else worth watching. Beside the general wackiness.She suddenly can't remember important information, like their first date. Her personality has undergone a complete 180 degree shift, for instance now she enjoys jumping in cold water when the night before she HATED it. And there are those mysterious marks appearing all over her... Insect bites, she says. HA!! The clincher is when she begins to give birth to what looks like giant sea slugs. And I am happy to report: Mother and gross slimy molluscs are doing just fine. WELL THAT'S A RELIEF, THEN!!If you see an intense light shining on a person in a movie when they're asleep after dark in bed, I immediately assume ALIENS. Was I right? 10 points to me! There was one thing I was misled on though... after seeing an inordinate amount of what resembled frogspawn around, I jumped to the conclusion that the female had become a clone a'la Invasion Of The Body Snatchers. Turned out the explanation is even more stupid than that... This lady is being transformed from inside, and soon she'll be departing Mother Earth against her will with the extraterrestrial lifeforms.Not to worry... She was kind enough to spend a few more days on our soil with her partner before shuffling off in a spaceship. Except... It ISN'T her... heck, I saw that about 48 hours before the supposed 'love of her life' did. It would been kinder for her to just be taken up to the stars straightaway... Perhaps leaving a note behind for her ex, with a little white lie attached so he could get over her in time. But, no... instead she frustrates him with her bizarre behaviour for the duration they're still together... And later even KILLS the poor dude accidentally when she tries to hide him underwater from those nasty aliens. Yes, she's so out of it she forgot he only had lungs.None of this makes a lick o'sense, and could only be described as a drug influenced dream. Which is what everyone involved in this junk must have been on when they agreed to participate in it. Can I have some, please? I feel like asking my mother to write my pinhead sister out of the will... And a dose or two of this could be invaluable... 3/10",positive
We Are Still Here,"I had high hopes for this one, especially after seeing where it was heading. Don't ask my why, cause there have been so many such productions, and still, somehow, I hoped for the best.OK, let us begin: the movie is not bad, it has some good jump scares, OK effects, decent plot tho ever used, good actors and a cold chill surrounding. So, why does it fail? I'll tell you: the plot brings nothing new, the ending is as predictable as it gets and it acts exactly like so many before it. OK, maybe the production is better, maybe the budget was bigger and used for the best, still, the story behind it all, has nothing new to offer, just that tired old formula.Once you see it, you'll understand. At points it even makes little sense. But more deaths had to occur therefore logic had to make a run for it. Overall, a 5, maybe even a solid 5 but nothing more.Cheers!",negative
We Are Still Here,"I was lucky enough to see this at a friends house last night, went into it blind, and oh boy what a nice surprise.Whilst yes, it's another haunted house movie, this brings something new to the table with a great climax to the film that really ramps it up.The performances from the whole cast are excellent,and the main four characters are likable and believable.The cinematography is excellent, and the whole film just has this authentic feel to it.I won't reveal anything of the storyline,as I think it's one of those films that's best enjoyed if you don't know too much about it,but as a seasoned horror fan,I found this one of the most refreshing films I've seen in years with some good tension and scares.I've seen some comments about 'B movie this, B movie that', but I didn't get that feeling at all, this had the feel of a 70's-80's classic horror.A little more character development of the villains would have made this even better, it could have stood another 10 minutes or more being added to the running time which would have allowed this.I'll be pre-ordering the Blu Ray as soon as possible,when there are so many horror films out there that shouldn't have even been released, this deserves my money and to be in my collection.",positive
Don't Hang Up,are all straight up pranks. I just want to shake anyone and throttle them until they come to their senses to claim this utter garbage is worth watching. Literally anything on CW is more entertaining to watch. Terrible twist that anyone could figure out. Direction is boring. CGI and use of social media is artificial. Actors are God awful. So much to dislike. The only reason I sat and watched the whole dreadful affair is because I am zapped of any energy due to the flu. I am easily amused and entertained when I super sick. So that's how I know how bad this movie is. Shame on anyone writing that this movie is clever and interesting. This is the kind of movie that is so bad that I am angry after watching it.,negative
Don't Hang Up,"Just got done watching it. Really liked it, nothing new but well done on old ideas. Kind of a cross between ""I know what you did last summer"" and ""saw"" with maybe a little ""are you in the house alone"" mixed in. High tension throughout, kept me interested and played out well. Lots of horror tropes that we all know and love (well some of us anyway) Looking at IMDb reviews and a lot of people didn't like it. But they're the same people who only like the artsier horror like Babadook or The Witch. Both good movies but sometimes you just want a good old fashioned slasher, something that doesn't make you think or try and figure it out. This is that movie.Good production value, good use of lighting, sound etc. Acting was decent and even though the ideas were old I thought the way they were brought about was good. I give it an 8 of 10, good use of an hour and a half on a boring night.",positive
Housebound,"I had high hopes for this horror/comedy movie based off the reviews I've read. Usually, I don't know many successful horror/comedy movies, but the one's that are good, are quite rare. The beginning of this movie was entertaining and funny, I thought the whole movie was going to be like this, but I was wrong. It never really ""took off"" for me. In the middle of the movie, only a few things that happened that was considered funny, and there were slight jump scares; besides that, it was pretty boring. It wasn't until near the end of the movie when the entertainment picked back up.I was watching this with my friends and family and none of them enjoyed it, some even fell asleep. Personally, this movie was just okay. I wish it was more funnier, but I found myself most of the time- just waiting for something to happen. Don't get me wrong, this movie wasn't bad, and I thought it had huge potential.Some people may enjoy it, but I found it pretty slow half way into the movie.",negative
Housebound,"After the endless, mind numbing, clichéd, regurgitated rubbish one has to sift through these days, just hoping to find something truly enjoyable and a bit original; stumbling across this great little gem returns my faith a bit. It's great to be reminded that fresh and inspired ways of telling a story ARE still out there! It may be harder to find them now, but when you do, it's like a breath of fresh air to a movie lover like myself.There are only two movies to have done this for me very recently, ""NO ONE LIVES"" and now, HOUSEBOUND. Although two very different movies, it's the fresh and entertaining take on the genre that really stands out. It proves once more that you don't need famous actors, big directors or massive budgets;just talented vision and good story telling.For what it was trying to achieve within the genre, HOUSEBOUND was a perfect film for me. I laughed, I cringed, I was intrigued,I cared about what happened to all the relevant characters and the production quality was good. The Kiwi's don't do it often,but when when they do, they do it well. I won't say anything more about it, just watch it and see for yourself.I hope to see more from this film maker in the future!",positive
The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death,"Oh dear oh dear HAMMER..where do I start with this appalling bit of unimaginative garbage. Lets says a few words for the actors because they are the only good thing in the whole film. They struggle and probably held back their laughter at some of the appalling lines that had to be delivered, and Helen McCrory, why Helen why?? You're an excellent actress especially on stage and you've severely wasted your talent here, your reputation can only be damaged by agreeing to be in this poor excuse for a film.Did they dig up a BBC TV cinematographer who lit an episode of Dr Who in the 1980's??? It was like a watching some lousy cheap xmas special that was knocked out within few days and ZERO thought was given to ""atmospheric lighting"", this is a meant to be a horror film, you have to create atmosphere to keep the mood of the film, to keep an audience scared, enthralled, intrigued, and most importantly make it look COMMERCIAL, not light it in the style of below par art house knock off for a personal showreel, having lens flares and portions of the frame out of focus do not make you artistic DUMMY, they make you look incompetent which this DOP is, did this person just sleep their way through the project, did this silly DOP think for more than 5 minutes, are they capable of one creative thought in their brain?? What on earth is Hammer thinking when they are making a sequel to the biggest hit they've had in years and they employ talentless unimaginative incompetents like this?? Just look across the pond at the US horror films, some may be bad but pretty much all of them at this budget level all look slick, moody, atmospheric and COMMERCIAL not sub par art house. Now lets get on to the director, never heard of him before but again this person shows such a deep lack of understanding of the horror genre that you'd think he just stumbled on the set by accident from a heavy night out and started directing this silly piece of nonsense. He keeps using a scare technique that when you see it the first time you think OK, not bad but then he goes on to repeat it about 11 times more, and by the 11th time you think. PLEASE STOP, GET A CLUE! Along with the useless DOP who probably dominated the director with their appalling shots, this director was just walking through the production for the pay check, hang your head in shame, this was a chance of taking the franchise in new directions but its wasted by a lack of imagination of the horror genre.In summation, this film could have been so good but Hammer in their haste to cash in have misfired and shot themselves in the foot, backside and face.A ROYAL STINKER, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",negative
The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death,"I personally enjoyed the movie very much. It wasn't too scary but it was interesting. If you like a ghost with a back story this is your movie.. Also if you are a young lady a certain fellow is quite darling. It also has a sort of interesting development of the main character as you learn more about her.This movie is not full of action or gore, in fact it's quite simple. Though you are kept thoughtful and wondering. The movie is like a puzzle and you are trying to figure out who lives and who will die. I loved it. I loved the year it was placed in and I loved the child actors. But if you want a very enthralling horror movie, this is not it. It's more of a mystery type with a little romance thrown in.",positive
The Pyramid,"The thing with ""the Pyramid"" is that it has great presentation. The poster looks good, the trailer looks good too. It's enough to fool most people into watching it, expecting a film with some good scares. I, for one, went in expecting some claustrophobic terror like ""the Descent"".Unfortunately, the Pyramid is not good, not good at all. In fact, it's just boring. The characters all suffer from being utterly unlikeable, from the annoying cameraman to the just as annoying blonde girl. From there the film turns into a boring drag, wherein every trick in the book is pulled: jump scares, cheap CGI, lots and lots of yelling and screaming, exposition that makes no sense. You name it.This movie is awful. Don't watch it.",negative
The Pyramid,"It happens often that a bad flick is massively overrated at IMDb, but bad ratings are normally trustworthy. Since now i only found a few cases where the bad rating was totally wrong. The Pyramid is one of them.Lots of people write about the bad acting in that movie. Well to be honest at the first 10 minutes of the movie the acting or lets say the script is not that brilliant. And thats normal for this kind of horror movies. You have to always bear the boring beginning where every character is presented and the connections between them are explained. But in The Pyramid that scenery is refreshingly short before the main plot starts.The movie is about claustrophobic sceneries, mystery and the supernatural. And this is done very well. The creatures in that creature horror movie are well made, animated and their background story fits perfectly. This is without any question a professional crafted flick and nothing looks cheap.The whole movie delivers exactly what you are expecting. But in that case with really fresh new ideas and a story which was completely new. And this is great in a time where even high end productions are mostly cheap ripoffs of older movies or new interpretations of stories which where told a hundred times before.The end is also surprising, because in that kind of horror movies you normally can spot out the person which will survive with a 100% accuracy if you are used to that genre.As others mentioned before. The modern concept of ""men in movies are always useless idiots and all women are hard boiled"" is also a part of this movie and its a mood killer. The way the horror movies are made nowadays is that they just replaced the usual two guys of the group which are somehow tough with women and left the rest of the more fearful and useless characters to the men. It does not fit. Light dressed beautiful women in horror movies are there to be eye candy, to mix in some beauty into the horror. And you can spice up the plot with a helpless women which has to be saved. If you do not do that you can just cut out the women and make a male only horror flick, because it will not make any difference. I guess that is the main reason for the bad ratings. A busty pretty girl in a ripped tank top as fan service for the guys and and a bearded muscular hard boiled guy in a dirty white t-shirt as fan service for the girls would have done the trick and the movie would have gotten at least a two point higher rating.But altogether The Pyramid is a well crafted creature horror movie which i have enjoyed very much.",positive
The Quiet Ones,"The film is slow, plodding and lacks any depth. The scares don't scare. It lacks suspense or creepiness. Character development falls flat on it's face; you just don't become endeared to any of the characters, at all. Rory Fleck-Byrne and Erin Richards seem completely redundant in the film. Jared Harris performed well, but even he couldn't save this one. I think the whole possession thing has been done to death, and to pull it off nowadays takes strong characters, a solid story and a bit of a twist. Insidious for example. I personally wouldn't waste time and money on the film. Wait until it comes on TV in a couple of years. Definitely not a must watch movie.",negative
The Quiet Ones,"Aside from The Exorcist, possession films always seem so lacking. They never have enough real, human tension. They focus on predictable jump scares and an even more predictable plot. It's safe to say that, in general, possession films don't have much to offer. Thankfully, The Quiet Ones does not suffer from the same faults of many other similar films. Rather than simply focus on the dark progression of a possessed being, The Quiet Ones presents the frustrating fears that torment the young, inexperienced scientists, as they struggle with their desire to help a suffering being through the means of science and logic, the underlying threat of possible demonic possession,and the obsessive nature of Professor Coupland. The performance of the cast is top notch, the effects are subtle, the only disappointing aspect was the very, very end, and the fact that as a whole, the film just wasn't that scary. Still, if the concept of possession interests you, but you've been disappointed with past projects, you might want to give this a shot.",positive
The Den,"This movie is by far one of the lamest and most unsatisfactory horror movies I've ever seen. Second only to Dark Skies. The end offers very little explanation and leaves the viewer with a lot of questions and more than a little frustrated. The plot takes twists and turns and ultimately turns around and goes backward leaving the conflict unresolved (kinda like Dark Skies). all of the characters are very static and have no progression including our main heroine. And not to mention most of the camera work (shot entirely through the cameras on the phones and computers) was a lot like Cloverfield what with all the running and screaming and the viewer can't really see anything unless she/he wants to end up with a migraine. I wish I hadn't wasted the seventy six minutes watching it, and my advice is that you go watch something interestingly thought provoking like The Tall Man.",negative
The Den,OMG those are my first words about this movie. I will first say I'm a Horror movie buff and I have seen more horror films then I can count and it is my favorite genre of films so with that said I will begin. I had first seen a trailer and heard about this movie a few months prior to it's release and I couldn't wait to watch it just based on the premise. I love found footage movies.I will say that I didn't know any of the actors nor was I worried bc that doesn't always make a great horror film as this shows. The actors did a terrific job especially the main girl Elizabeth. I will say that for a short film it was Uber intense and very much kept you on the edge of your seat. The violence was gritty and in your face and the questions it raises are very valid especially from a technology standpoint. I for one don't scare easy at all and the jump scares were the best I have seen in a while and even knowing they were coming and it still got me was Impressive.I would recommend this movie to any and all that love horror and appreciate what this film does in the time span it is allotted. I would also note that the movie does raise one or two questions but nothing that would kill the movie buzz once the credits start rolling. I for one hope this director keeps up with his career bc as I said I love this movie and it is def going in the books for direction as well as great scares and overall atmosphere.,positive
Knights of Badassdom,"This was one of the biggest let downs of recent memory. After reading all of the positive reviews, and seeing the incredibly high rating, I really thought I would be in for a treat. The movie wasn't funny, except for a few mild smiles here and there. The special effects, especially towards the end, were atrocious. And the characters were wooden with nothing brought to the screen. And the main premise for the demon was a cringe worthy rip off of the Necronomicon from Evil Dead. The movie has a incredible cast with Peter Dinklage, Summer Glau, Ryan Kwanten, and Steve Zahn. But unfortunately they totally failed to use almost any of their characters to their full (or any) potential. Ryan Kwanten was the only one who was even half way interesting. There were countless times that they could have made something humorous, or even hysterical, but instead it fell totally flat and was just bland. (Where was them humor after the games began and they set it up so obviously for Dinklage?!) I can understand fans of larping enjoying this film, as that unique aspect was the only half way saving grace of this snore-fest. But I can't imagine anyone else could even find it more than mildly entertaining. 3/10 stars and that's being generous.",negative
Knights of Badassdom,"I was extremely lucky to attend the world premiere! The screening was held at the ""Icon"" festival (sort of the Israeli version of comic-con) in Tel-Aviv, Israel. The screening began at midnight on the night of Sep. 24-25 2013. The movie was introduced by one of the producers. She got on stage, said a few words about the film and then dropped the bomb on all of us - This was the world premiere! The theater ERUPTED! Clapping and hooting for a good 2 minutes before she could keep on talking.What can I say? It was a theater packed with geeks and everyone went wild! the film is fantastic! The cast is brilliant and I laughed out loud at least 20 times (Even though on this page it doesn't say that the movie is actually a comedy - it totally is!). People were even clapping and cheering at many key moments. The feeling in the room was electric. We don't know which cut we got to see though, but it didn't feel too long - just right, in fact. Peter Dinklage is wonderful as usual and Summer Glau's performance - she was was fantastic. She is every geek's wet dream of course.. But she really delivered the whole ""I'm not really into this but I'm playing along with it"" role. She looked amazing in her costume! Her on screen chemistry with the other characters was excellent. She is definitely one of the underrated actresses out there.The film itself has some great plot twists and even though it had a very low budget - it manages to escape the feel of a B-movie. It even had some pretty good CGI animation. At the end everyone was clapping and as I walked out of the theater, feeling giddy - EVERYONE was smiling, laughing, reminiscing and all in all I didn't hear a single person saying anything negative about it. The only reason this film gets a 9 is because a 10 is reserved for maybe 5- 10 movies in my life. If you are a geek, were a geek, or simply have a little bit of geekyness in you - don't hesitate when it is released - it's worth every penny! Go with friends who appreciate this kind of stuff. I was never much of a role-playing fan and still felt completely connected to this film. Well done!!",positive
The Hallow,"About as scary as a field full of bunnies playing with skipping ropes and singing Gangnam Style (actually that is kind of scary), debut director Corin Hardy's Irish horror The Hallow certainly has an initially intriguing idea that very quickly within its short (yet somehow looooong) run time peters out into a downright laughable horror fable that is far too daft and po-faced for its own good.After a nice set up of 10 – 15 minutes or so of creepy forest scenery, nasty looking black goo and an unfortunate deer, everything seems to be relatively on track for The Hallow but within a quick-fire succession of angry locals who are upset about work being done in their woodlands and warn of evil pixies, fairies or who even cares, laugh out loud road side attacks and some bizarre and extended home invasion attempts, The Hallow loses all hopes of ever becoming a successful horror genre entry in an abundance of daft and overwrought ideas and conceptions.Centring his unbelievable and far from terror inducing plot around new parents Adam and Clare played un-charismatically by Jospeh Mawle and Australia's own Bojana Novakovic respectively, The Hallow neither has the characters we care for, a plot that stands up on inspection (overall this film seems to take place over an incredibly long night) or the nasties to make us shiver and even though some of the CGI and makeup effects of the woodland ghouls and gremlins do look somewhat nefarious, on close inspection there's just nothing in The Hallow that makes it either scary, interesting or on any real level engaging, stopping any chance Hardy's film had of making an impact.Winning praise from certain critic circles and even winning the odd award, The Hallow seemingly struck a chord with selective audiences around the world and Hardy's name has cropped up in recent times as a director to keep a close eye on but for me and perhaps many others, The Hallow is a diabolically bad attempt at crafting an under your skin horror experience and a genuinely bad movie regardless of genres.½ an unhelpful farmer out of 5",negative
The Hallow,"The Hallow or The Woods as it is otherwise known is a UK/Irish collaboration. Its by no means a mainstream horror flick, yet, in spite of its humble credentials, its actually not half bad. The scares in The Hallow come on on quite early and linger till ""after"" the closing credits. This should make the impatient viewer quite happy. There is a nominal amount of ratcheting up the tension in this film which is followed by an abundance of reasonably well executed creature scares. The creatures themselves tap into a supposedly Irish mythology about spirits and fairy like creatures that ""assimilate"" those who violate their forest haven. There's a lot to like here. The setting is suitably creepy, the premise is well established and convincing. What's also refreshing is the couples very sane reaction when confronted with the creatures, that is, to run like hell. Perhaps the only downside to this film, I felt, was its early introduction of the monsters. I believe this film would have been more effective with a more gradual application of tension and maybe another ten-fifteen minutes run time. That said, The Hallow still hits all the right horror buttons and does so in a convincing and creative manner. Eight out of ten from me.",positive
Life After Beth,"LIFE AFTER BETH (2014) * Aubrey Plaza, Dane DeHaan, John C. Reilly, Molly Shannon, Cheryl Hines, Paul Reiser, Matthew Gray Gubler, Anna Kendrick, (Cameo: Garry Marshall) Laugh-free one-note joke 'rom-com/zom-com' with a very game Plaza (honey, fire your agent immediately) who returns from the dead as a smooth-jazz loving (!), anger management zombie who winds up causing all sorts of 'polite society' ills for her confused family and beloved boyfriend (DeHaan is the only one who really acts up a storm for an otherwise forgettably awful film). The crimes against comedy (let alone humanity) is first-time (and hopefully LAST time) filmmaker Jeff Baena who wouldn't recognize a fart from an ad-lib in his tone-deaf attempt at satire, dark comedy or sharp skewer to cul-de-sac audiences he's so desperately catering to while completely wasting his vast amount of talent acquired (squandering so much comedic casting is unbearably sad). And trust me you would never want to see comedy guru Marshall as a member of the undead in spotty make-up and doddering dialogue! (Un)dead on arrival.",negative
Life After Beth,"This is a horror comedy. Except, it's not. People who expect the usual mix of jump scares and laughs from this movie end up most disappointed. It's a love story with zombies. But not a happy one like Warm Bodies. Much more sad and dramatic. And humor is much more dry and subtle. Unfortunately, people who sit down to watch a zombie comedy do not really expect subtle. And people who want subtle do not look into zombie comedies. This is why this little gem is one of the most underrated movies on IMDB. Watch it without expectations and you might enjoy it much more.",positive
Last Shift,"I have to give credit to Juliana Harkavy because if not for her convincing performance, I would not have been able to finish this heap of garbage. Last Shift follows an officer covering the final overnight shift of a police station that's closing down. It's one of those isolated, creepy slow burn movies that can get under your skin. At least, that's what it could have been. What Last Shift lacks most is subtlety. There are jump scares *everywhere*. There's one sequence where it's just ""boo!"" after ""jump!"" after ""ahh!"" and it's just f*cking annoying after a while because none of it works. This wouldn't be such an issue if the story was relatable but it's not. The creepy cult angle has been done a million times before. Last Shift also features every haunting trope in existence - doors slamming, dead people hallucinations, whispering, singing - it's freaking exhausting. The way the story is told is even worse. They introduce characters solely for the purpose of exposition. Instead of trying to push the narrative forward with some character development or any semblance of humanity, these characters just say exactly what's going on and then leave. Nothing is left to the imagination. The movie plays its hand right off the top and forces us down this rabbit hole of insanity and stupidity for an hour and a half. Another thing is the protagonist isn't relatable. Harkavy gave a fine performance given the material but her character is a dumbass. She should've hauled ass out of there twenty minutes into the movie but no, staying and protecting this abandoned sh*thole of a police station is more important than keeping her sanity. Yeah, no. There's nothing salvageable here. The subject matter is inherently disturbing but it's exploitation in its purist form. It doesn't go into the psychology of cults or having a family member tied to a heinous crime. It's just like, hey, sh*t happens. Surface level scares that don't even scratch the surface. After a while of bashing you over the head with jump scares you're so desensitized to everything it becomes a waiting game for the movie to end. I guess Last Shift succeeds as an exercise in patience - how long can you sit through every poorly constructed horror cliché known to man? I recommend skipping this shift, even if it means losing the job. Whatever they're paying, it's not worth this.",negative
Last Shift,"Others might not think the movie is as good as i'm saying it is, but this is my opinion. The movie actually scared me, which is something that doesn't happen often with horror movies. It didn't need to be a generic slasher film in order to induce fear. It delved deep into psychological fear, which is what I like. Not many movies can successfully do what this movie did. The story itself interested me, and during every twist in the storyline, I was on the edge of my seat. Yes, there were jumpscares, but not predictable ones. Sure, here and there there would be some weird scenes, or scenes that I felt the movie didn't really need, but the fact that they made something out of nothing and actually made it good, makes me think it deserves a 10 out of 10 rating.",positive
The Darkness,"I am Diné (Navajo) and I am giving this movie one star because the acting was good. But the story line is way off. First of all Anasazi to Navajo is ""ancient enemy"", Second we don't speak Spanish nor use Christian symbols for ceremonial purposes and third at least use a real Navajo and the one that is fluent in Diné Bizaad (Navajo language). I am sure they can find one person on the rez. We all still practice our culture and ceremonies (medicine men) to this day. Its funny they use Hopi Kachinas as Anasazi people.

Kill Command,"Mind the spoiler alert.So we have a group of soldiers send to a training island to test their skills against their replacements aka droids. Because there is an excessive amount of data being learned by the droids the tech girl who designed and programmed them is send along with them to asses the product.They easily take out some old versions and think they're done. All the wile outwards communication is being blocked but they don't seem to mind that and just stand around a lot. Don't get me wrong the movie is quite decent, way better than most of the other ""low budget"" sci-fi creations.Anyhow here are a few things I didn't like about the movie. The girl/creator is way to silent. Even when it's abundantly clear something is wrong she still keeps quiet wile all the information they can get would have been helpful. Mayor annoyance.At some point they walk into the storage facility for the droids not activated at that time. Did they turn this into an advantage, NO! They could have destroyed them as all of them are equipped with a self-destruct EMP bomb to prevent their tech from falling into enemy hands.Or better jet as the creator is there with them she could have disconnected them from the network and given them a command to protect the humans. Did I mention she has a chip in her head/neck that gives her the ability to interact with those droids through a neural interface. So something like that really shouldn't have been hard to do and would have made it a much more realistic final battle if you have a good portion of the enemy taken out and then some left to battle by human hands.For some reason 1 of the droids is the boss. Even though they're networked and at some point 3 of the same boss type droids are activated. Anyway they salvage an EMP bomb from one of the destroyed droids somehow up it's power (don't ask how) and manage to take the boss out. Sacrificing herself as her chip gets affected too. But guess what that thing made to take out the tech to prevent it from falling into enemy hands doesn't work the boss gets up again and now goes after the creator who plays dead and then blasts a hole though it's head. Then her chip gives out completely and she dies. Guess what happens next, the darn boss droid gets up again and manages with his last ""breath"" to upload itself into her destroyed chip!? So quite a bit of ridiculousness at the end and if that wasn't bad enough it also leaves an open ending. No one likes those, hell personally that's for a large part why I don't watch horror flicks anymore as they nearly always end without an end.",negative
Kill Command,"I wasn't expecting too much from ""Kill Command"" when I stumbled upon it on Netflix, expecting it to be your typical run of the mill low budget sci fi actioner. Well, I will admit that the movie did exceed my expectations, albeit in one area. That area being the look of the movie. The movie is well photographed, and the other production values are top notch, particularly the special effects depicting the homicidal robots the protagonists have to fight off.So what's the problem? Well, although the movie looks good, it does not give the viewer the feeling a movie like this needs to give. For starters, the movie is quite slow, particularly in the first thirty minutes. Although the movie picks up the pace slightly after that point, the movie makes a serious stumble with the action sequences that then unfold. The action simply isn't that involving. It feels routine at best, and you never feel the protagonists' peril or panic. Add in a far too long running time (100 minutes), the viewing experience ends up being somewhat of a lengthy slog.",positive
Turbo Kid,"Let's make a movie about the future, but set it in the past and make it look like it was set even further in the past. That could've been the pitch for ""Turbo Kid"" (NR, 1:33) – and that's just one of many interesting and unusual things that there are to learn about this film even before discussing what it's about. For one thing, it's a co-production of Canada and New Zealand. Since it's technically a foreign film, it has no MPAA rating (but if it did, it would surely be rated ""R""). The movie has three directors, François Simard, Anouk Whissell and Yoann-Karl Whissell, all three of which also share credit for the screenplay, and all appear in the movie in small roles. What's more, the cinematographer, Jean-Philippe Bernier, is also one of the two people who did the film's score, which is a highly unusual combination of jobs. Now, let's get back to that highly unusual pitch summary in the first sentence of this paragraph.""Turbo Kid"" is a post-apocalyptic action movie set in the ""future"" year of 1997. That actually makes sense when you know that the film intentionally looks and sounds like it was made in the early 1980s. Stating it another way, this movie is ""retro futuristic"". It's a lot like many of the movies made in the late 70s and early 80s. In fact, the year picked for the story's setting, 1997, is the same year in which 1981's classic dystopian action thriller ""Escape from New York"" takes place. And that's not the only connection between other movies of this film's sub-genre. There are passing verbal references and visuals that are subtle shout-outs to movies like ""Soylent Green"" and ""The Terminator"". What's not so subtle is the strong and obvious influence of another post-apocalyptic film series from the 1980s (rebooted in 2015) on the plot, setting and costumes in this movie. As ""Wired"" magazine said, it's ""'Mad Max' on a BMX"".Munro Chambers plays a character simply called ""The Kid"", an orphaned teen just trying to survive in a land laid waste by something (?) which led to the end of civilized society. The Kid scavenges items that he can ""sell"" to his world's version of a pawn broker (Romano Ozari) for that most precious of commodities – water. The water that exists is under the control of a sadistic general called Zeus (Michael Ironside). As he brags to his ""minions"" (NOT the cute kind), he not only provides their liquid sustenance, but their entertainment as well. He sponsors regular violent and bloody gladiatorial-like contests between his ""henchmen"" (better word) and those unfortunate enough to have double-crossed Zeus or just crossed his path.When he's not scavenging, The Kid is obsessing over his favorite superhero, someone called ""Turbo Rider"". The Kid has various Turbo Rider memorabilia in his house and then gets a hold of an old Turbo Rider comic book, which he seems to value almost as much as staying hydrated. As he's sitting in an old playground reading his comic book aloud to himself, he's approached by a girl named Apple (played by Canadian actress Laurence Leboeuf) who wants to be friends. She's impossibly chipper (either gratingly or adorably, depending on your point of view) and she may or may not be a cold-blooded killer. But she insists on hanging out with The Kid, and, well, friends are hard to come by in this terrible future-past (or is it past-future?), so he lets her tag along as he scavenges.As dangerous as this time and place is, you have to be tough to survive. The Kid teaches Apple his rules for survival and soon the two of them meet someone even tougher than The Kid – a cowboy type named Frederic (Aaron Jeffery) who's an arm-wrestling champion and the closest thing that the few decent people left alive have to a protector. That is, until The Kid becomes Turbo Kid. He finds a costume that makes him look and feel like his hero, Turbo Man. The costume doesn't help him fly or anything, but it does have a pretty serious weapon built into one of the arms. The Kid becomes Turbo Kid just in the nick of time. For different reasons, Apple and Frederic both run afoul of Zeus and they need some serious turbo-charged rescuing! But even if Turbo Kid can free his only two friends from the clutches of Zeus, he'd likely be pretty ticked off and would probably want to hunt them down and, you know, kill them all.It's kind of a tough thing to judge this movie. On the one hand, it is very effective at evoking the feeling of cheesy early-80s future schlock. On the other hand, the violence (albeit comic violence) can be a bit excessive – unless you find dismemberment and gallons of fake blood shooting everywhere to be amusing. Still, the graphic destruction of so many human bodies notwithstanding, this movie deserves credit for being very different from any other 2015 release and it is more entertaining than not. All this comes out to a mild recommendation – with a strong warning. Considering all the blood and guts, a kids' movie this is not, but adults (especially those who like the cheesier movies of the 70s and 80s, and enjoy a good splatter flick) may find seeing ""Turbo Kid"" to be a blast. This B-movie gets a ""B"".",negative
Turbo Kid,"If your primary movie-going experience is watching Hollywood blockbusters with vin diesel, this may not be your cup of tea, but for everyone else, this film destroys it.This film is pure gold, 80's indulgent, brain melting gore, a love story, and even somewhat artistic at times.I won't drone on, but this film i destined to be a staple in horror/art house/comedy cinema.It is fast-paced, adorable, hilarious, brutal, and has a charm that only filmmakers in love with their genres can produce. This is not Hollywood, but you wouldn't know it. Often times I can either purchase a film to see it, or watch it streaming but, it's a rare occasion when i see a film and have to instantly purchase it.",positive
A Dark Song,"watched this movie after reading all the reviews here, hoping it was a hidden gem, disappointed and lost some credit points from my family as it was my choice. its a long winded film, bordering on some gross and disgusting scenes at times, with nothing to amount to it in the end.if you want real horror, stay away, watch if you want a good nap on a Saturday afternoon after lunch, works better than any sleeping pills. i give it a 2, because I'm not that mean.",negative
A Dark Song,"It makes such a change to get a supernatural movie that makes the viewer use their imagination, rather than bombarding them with CGI and men in rubber suits. This is a study of the old chestnut, 'Be careful what you wish for'. A young mother whose son had been murdered, seeks revenge on his killers via a magic ritual invoking angels. It's clearly influenced by the ""Bornless Ritual"", an invocation used by Aleister Crowley to summon his Holy Guardian Angel and the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage which Crowley attempted at Boleskin House on the shores of Loch Ness. The ritual allegedly requires at least 6 months of preparation, celibacy and abstinence from alcohol. However, it also includes the summoning of the 12 Kings and Dukes of Hell, to bind them and remove their negative influences from the magician's life. Crowley was in the process of performing the lengthy ritual, when he was called to Paris by the leader of the Golden Dawn. According legend,he never banished the demons he had summoned, leading to strange happenings occurring in and around Boleskine House. But I digress.There have been reviews that bang on about how slow this movie is, and it's lack of pace and excitement. But if you have any understanding of the supernatural, and this movie has been meticulously researched, you'd realise that the real horror lies in fear and what happens in your head. This woman, who so craves revenge, is on her own personal spiritual journey. She realises, at the 11th hour, that revenge and hatred offer nothing but pain and emptiness, and that forgiveness, both for her son's killers and herself, is what she really needs to find any peace.I liked the dynamic between the woman and occultist, the loathing and disrespect, the sharing and mutual need. There's one really funny moment where they both share their recurring dreams.The film is subtle in its suspense and horror, with a nice slow build and some really creepy effects. The ending seems a bit clichéd, but was saved from being corny by illustrating the power of forgiveness over revenge, and good over evil. On the whole, one of the better horror/supernatural movies of 2017 so far. I loved it.",positive
Wolf Creek 2,"Just last month, Stephen King wrote the following on his Twitter page: ""Horror is when you know and love the characters, but you also know something very bad is going to happen to them. It's not the monsters!"" And you see his point: In order to make horror films truly scary, we must feel afraid for the characters because we truly care for them. We want them to make it out alive. We want them to succeed. This isn't only exclusive to horror films. It applies to every film. If we don't care for the characters, why should we care about the story? What WOLF CREEK 2 and most horror films get wrong is how they couldn't care less for its characters.In WOLF CREEK 2, director Greg Mclean is all for the monster, and this is unfortunate because the monster isn't the hero of the story. He's just a evil figure lurking in the shadows ready to kill anyone that comes his way with some one-liners to shout throughout the film. He has no depth, no layers and neither do the protagonists, which makes it hard to sit through the film feeling anything but anger. All you're left with are set pieces with gore and gratuitous violence thrown on screen, but you don't feel anything because you just don't care.This is what separates good recent horror films like OCULUS and THE CONJURING from WOLF CREEK 2. And it's not to say Mclean isn't capable of making quality horror films. After all, he directed ROGUE, a monster flick that actually focuses on its characters and not the monster itself. It is no surprise to learn, then, that ROGUE is enjoyed more considerably than Mclean's WOLF CREEK films (ROGUE currently stands at a rare 100% on RottenTomatoes). Mclean attempts to flesh out the monster in WOLF CREEK 2, but he spends just 5 minutes to establish that Mick Taylor is a bigot and then continuously pounds the audience in the head about this fact through the rest of the film.As for the protagonists themselves, it doesn't get any better. They are useless, clueless, and uninteresting. I'm sorry, but in this day and age, giving the characters a significant other just doesn't cut it, even when they're heard off screen. More characters appear as the film goes along, but we quickly find out they're there to die a few minutes later, often in gruesome and unpleasant ways. And don't get me started on the female characters. Are we still in the era where all they do is stay on the sidelines and scream helplessly? Aren't we passed that? Or a better question might be SHOULDN'T we be passed that? Regardless, the characters should have been handled better, but it's clear the director was more interested in building a legacy for Mick Taylor to stand beside the likes of Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, and Michael Myers than creating real, sympathetic characters to root for.I despised this film. I despised the senseless violence, the two dimensional characters, and the villain. WOLF CREEK 2 is a perfectly packaged product of what's wrong with modern horror films. It's a string of bloody set pieces barely held together by a script (if that). It's not even fun to sit through in a so-bad-it's-good kind of way. Well, maybe except for the scene involving CGI kangaroos. However, if you're the type of person who wants to cheer for the monster, then so be it. I just wished director Greg Mclean would make more films like ROGUE than continuing to build his WOLF CREEK franchise.",negative
Wolf Creek 2,"Many people were hugely disappointed by the original Wolf Creek, largely because it sold itself as the most terrifying film ever made which turned out to be nonsense. I ordered the unrated version online here in the UK because I wanted to see it in full (I have an intense hatred for all things BBFC) but even that was limp and uneven. That said, the tourist hating killer within definitely had something going for him, and I wasn't totally adverse to watching him again on a second outing, so it was with some low expectations I approached WC2, and my was I pleasantly surprised. . . It looks as if they had a major rethink of the film this time, and while there was some humour in part one, this time it's amped up to ten. I laughed many many times at the (dark) comedy Wolf Creek has now become - but this may depend on what your sense of humour is like (mine's a little twisted) as the laughs always accompany some gory scenes. There are one liners while a penis is lopped off, where a field of kangaroos get wiped out, some Germans get offed, and as fingers are removed with a grinder, it's bloody fantastic. And the previous attempt at being all serious has been left behind with fun being the driving force now. Honestly this is the most fun flick I've seen this year, and after 3 viewings it didn't lose its charm. I know many horror fans will probably avoid this movie because of being let down by part one, but you'll be missing a true gem this time. Check it out, a new horror anti hero is born.",positive
Tales of Halloween,"I like a good, strange movie occasionally, but this one made little sense most of the time.I won't comment on the acting or effects, there are enough reviews that I have seen regarding those. And as a fan of the classic Universal monster, old Vincent Prince, Three Stooges and Abbott and Costello monster movies, I knkw that seldom does acting or effects determine my enjoyment of a spooky-season movie. Cohesive storytelling on the other hand, that is important. I can forgive a multitude of sins if the story makes sense.Tales of Halloween is described as ""the best horror anthology since Trick'r Treat"". But where Trick'r Treat's connectivity was integrated into each story, (characters appearing in the background, Sam being present, past events influencing more than one story), this rancid pile of pumpkin gut's connections are tenuous at best. The only real connection is the radio DJ narrative and a couple times you do catch a glimpse of characters from other stories. Few of the stories make any sort of sense if any at all, and those that do have the potential to make decent spooky story, Trick and Grim Grinning Ghost for example, are so short they might as well have been left out altogether.When you go back and read the blurb, these are supposed to be some of the top directors in horror. One would think, that an anthology created by top directors in a genre, would be more cohesive and fleshed out, but it feels more like they each just phoned it in.If anything, this mess mocks Halloween in general, and not in a fun satirical way. It's more like a school yard bully vs the nerdy, Halloween-loving kid.I would have preferred a return of Sam with new tales or even a return of The Crypt-keeper from the 90s.For my Halloween entertainment I'll stick to Trick'r Treat and Tales from the Crypt.",negative
Tales of Halloween,"i don't give '10' flippantly. this is a 10this turned up at the Mile High Horror Film Festival. it plays like a block of shorts in that each tale stands on it's own as a CreepShow style short story. consistent look and feel, and loose tying together though plays like a featureeach vignette has its own hook. don't be alarmed! watch each to the end to have that ""aha!"" momentcampy, fun, plenty of goo. not really scary in the traditional sense, but very entertaining all the same. more like a haunted house with little jumps and gags here and therecharacters overlap as extras from story to story, very clevermostly practical effects, yay! goo looks like props teams had fun coming up with these gagsrecommended!",positive
Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones,"From beginning to end, it's awful, If you're watching the whole series just stop at the 3rd. The makers of this movie should offer refunds for putting this garbage out. It's a film just to make money from the loyal PA fans.I also hate film makers that think harming (or pretending to harm) dogs or animals is any way a selling point or humorous. Get a grip, get a life, and get some real ideas instead of living off the popularity of a set of films.If you're going to watch this at all, don't, just go find another movie on the shelf.",negative
Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones,"I personally feel this one was better that all of the past ones. The other movies are really good too,but they are all very similar and have very boring scenes, but This time I think they were very original with the whole supernatural powers thing, they keep you entertained all the time with that. And also the fact that they did it with a different culture was really cool too. When it comes to getting people scared, it had some really scary scenes. This movies deserves a much better rating. I hope they keep making horror movies like this one. And you do not need to see all the other movies for this one except for the first one. But besides that it was a very different story, with facts that are not revealed in the other movies.",positive
Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension,"This film, to put it very bluntly, was one of the worst horror films I have seen in recent years. The trailer for this film had me believing that The Paranormal Activity series may have come up with a new, truly scary, idea. The promise of, ""like something you've never seen,"" which flashes across the screen during the trailer convinced me that the film would have a new concept that finally revealed just how terrifying the Activities would have been if you could see them happening right in front of you. However, this film does exactly the opposite. It's literally the same idea that was introduced in previous Paranormal Activity films with the added exception of now you get to SEE the activity take place. Hmmmm that huge black figure hovering over my daughter is quite peculiar. I know i'll set up some more cameras, instead of getting my daughter the hell out of that room, so I can be reassured that she is truly getting staulked by a demon. The actors in this film are so incredibly unconvincing it pains me to watch. You know you picked the wrong people for the job when you walk out of the theatre and think the best performance was done by a 7 year old child. When the priest, who apparently knew nothing about exorcisms, learns overnight how to remove demons from a household he claims he knows what do. It was laughble. I kept waiting for him to hit a boom box that immediately started playing the Ghostbusters theme song. In all honesty, Bill Murray flying through the door with his proton pack, sucking up all the demons in the house, would have proved to been a better ending than what preceded. The Director's attempt to incorporate ideas from other horror films such as the Insidious series which introduced a sort of Ghost Dimension called the further, if you've seen this you know what I'm talking about, was a complete fail. The Ghost Dimensions scare factor was destroyed by a poor story line and sub-par actors and actresses. The jump scenes were so unoriginal they failed to even draw a wince out of a majority of the theatre. A movie that lasted 1 hour and 30 minutes provided the worst display of rising action I had ever scene. I sat there for an hour and 15 minutes anxiously waiting for a climax to the story, and when it did it was a huge let down. The Director apparently forgot that he need an ending to his uneventful story. ""O shoot you know what I forgot to write an ending because I was to busy trying to scare people with my incredible jump scenes. Better just kill everyone off."" The ending is so brief and SOOOO damn unoriginal I was tempted to start my rant right in the theatre. A lot of horror films are utter failures but something about this one forced me to write a poor review on it. The fact that these films still draw viewers, including myself, is beyond me. The Ghost Dimension places the cherry on top the mound of doodoo left behind by the previous 5 films. They've squeezed every last drop out of the franchise and in my opinion this film should be, and hopefully will be, the last installment for this franchise.",negative
Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension,"So, I saw an advanced preview of this film so there wasn't many ratings up. After the preview I looked and it was rating around an average of 5 out of 10.....did I miss something? I loved this movie, not enough to give it a 10, but enough.I think the main thing to focus on this film is the 3D, if you see it in 2D you have made a terrible terrible mistake. The 3D is amazing!! It actually legitimately makes you jump as the objects hurtle towards you, I flinched. Then the 3D element isn't just carried out with tricks like that, but actually all throughout the movie, as you see specks of the demons black liquid stuff (best way I can describe that) floating around, and it looks like you can reach out and touch it and the camera they use to see the demon (you'll see if you watch the movie) looks good in 3D.Sure, the actual storyline wasn't the absolute best, and the CGI was slightly less convincing....cause let's face it, when is CGI ever really truly convincing. But the acting was good, a believable family and an amazingly creepy little girl, and it was a genuinely thought out plot, easy to follow, carried on from the other films (so tied up loose ends), a little bit scary, a little bit nail biting. Overall a good horror movie. Go see it, but....see it in 3D, or you will miss out on the intended experience!",positive
The Devil's Candy,Of course I'm not going to spoil it but it is sad that people will have to find out for themselves how dumb the end of the movie is. The whole last 15-20 minutes or so are just tragic. I suspend disbelief and love terrible exploitation movies but this.... I was eye rolling the whole last part of the movie.,negative
The Devil's Candy,The devils candy delivers the king of sheer horror you don't see that often. I entered this movie thinking it was going to be boring and bad but I was proven so wrong. I do suggest that any horror fan should definitely watch this incredibly disturbing film.,positive
Pay the Ghost,"I actually don't mind ol' Nic, I find him amusing to watch, the 'it's my job.' character motivation thing. I Had read another reviewers post about this movie and can only heartily agree that he is obviously now at the stage where he is accepting jobs as is, no read through of scripts, no discussion of character;someone on his team (does he have a team?) is basically not doing their job and proof reading the material he is being offered.I wanted to enjoy this movie, it's a ghost story, I really only want any of them to do well, but they never do. I actually only found one section near the end of the movie interesting, then it went the way of the Dodo.Could I suggest just not seeing this movie, I could,but I wont, not really, go watch it, revel in it's crapness, be in awe that Hollywood produces garbage on this scale routinely all the time, it has such a bloody stranglehold over content and subject that again and again movies are just dire, they hold nothing and entertain no one, aside from idiots! The whole Hollywood system is just wrong.",negative
Pay the Ghost,"It's pretty generic ""lost my son! someone believe me supernatural forces are at work! i'll go get him myself!"" plot. The acting was well done. It wasn't super annoying (if you watched the Last Witch Hunter, it's that sort of quality of writing and acting but the CGI was worse in pay the ghost) Very predictable dialogue and storyline, but I am a fan of horror movies that aren't super gory or too much thriller or jump scares out of nowhere so this was PERFECT for me! I recommend entirely! I like Nic Cage movies and this is another one of his better films. I just like it when he's a dad and not a treasure hunter. I think he's getting to that age that he can't play the dad of young children anymore. He looks over 50!",positive

Stree,"A zany supernatural parable that is both strongly feminist and uproariously funny, Stree, Amar Kaushik's self-assured first feature, delivers shocks and laughs in equal measure. Despite its repeated to-ing and fro-ing between conflicting tones, the horror comedy glides along a firm and steady arc almost all through its runtime of two hours and a bit.The film's fear quotient, like its comic flourishes, varies pretty wildly - in the climatic moments, it even wobbles just a touch - but the sight of fully grown men cowering in panic at the very mention of the spectral figure who gives the film its title is always hilarious, even when it tilts towards the terrifying.",positive
Shut In,"This movie can be summed up in a single word: awful. The performances were phoned in, the plot was weak, and the premise was ridiculous.***** SPOILERS *****The person who wrote this drivel apparently expected everyone to believe a number of complete implausibilities: that a catatonic boy who requires extreme care would be released to a home that lacks any accommodation for his condition other than an adjustable bed; that someone could convincingly fake being catatonic for six months; that despite his need to never be seen moving about, he also managed to slip his mother frequent doses of a tranquilizer that had been prescribed to him (we aren't shown how he managed this); that somehow the missing pills were never noticed during the six month period; that a raccoon rummaging in the garbage outside would wake her from her drug- induced sleep feeling compelled to investigate, but her supposedly catatonic son running around the house at night didn't disturb her a bit; and that the little boy trapped in the house only managed to make it to Naomi during the night when she was in drugged slumber and the fake catatonic was free to run around, not during the day when the fake catatonic had to sit passively in his chair or reveal his farce.In my experience, the care the makers' of a movie take with the minor details shows how much they care about the production as a whole. Here, they apparently didn't give a f---. An unexpected visitor tells the mother that the huge storm raging outside has already deposited so much snow that the end of her driveway was blocked when the road was plowed. Yet a little while later, when she runs outside, her driveway appears freshly plowed and there is a well beaten path to a dock on a little lake or pond. Despite the supposedly raging winter storm, the dock is free of snow and ice. Although it is supposed to be bitterly cold, there is not so much as a crust of ice on the pond/lake. This list could go on and on, but that's enough.In short, there are so many good movies out there, that it would be a shame to waste any time watching this one.",negative
Shut In,"I'm not sure why this movie is getting such bad reviews. I actually thought it was pretty good.I enjoy ""psychological thrillers"" that keep you guessing, and this movie kept me guessing. I wasn't sure what was real, who was doing what, or exactly how it would end.I thought the acting was great and that the scenery was lovely.If anything, it was a little more horror-esque than I really needed, but overall I did not feel as though it was a waste of time or money.I enjoyed the pacing of the movie and felt that they built up to a good climactic ending.

Area 51,"Bought this film from Sky. What a load of crap. Only watched it because I'd paid money for it and thought it might get better. Unfortunately, it only got worse. If this had been free, I would have deleted it within 30 mins. Please, please, please, do not waste any of your life watching this utter crap. This Film Is Complete And Utter Rubbish. Quite honestly I think it was written and acted as if this was your first drama project in secondary school. You're given an idea and had to develop it. If I had been their teacher, I would have gave them an F, in fact it would have been ungraded.

Even now, I still think it's completely relevant to the horror genre.Area 51 isn't perfect. I don't think any movie is; possibly with the exception of Fight Club. However it's the best piece of cinema I've seen lately. I think it's ludicrous that Area 51 has received a 4.3 rating when movies that are much worse (YellowBrickRoad) receive a much higher rating.Not even gonna lie; when I watched YellowBrickRoad I was expecting it to pick up any moment. The entire time. I was left feeling robbed, cheated and in a state of confusion - What the hell was that garbage?It seems reviewers on here only tend to give high ratings to the ""Artsy"" films with subtle hints at trivial things..

Monsters: Dark Continent,"What a load of pretentious, art w*nk nonsense this film really is.It's bad enough that the story is paper thin and the characters are as unlikeable as an upset stomach (one minute gangsta tough, the next screaming like babies) but the direction is shocking.It's like a frustrated art student trying out every possible style of image capture. Long shots, close shots, lens flare, angled, shaky cam, slow mo and none of them working.One pointless scene of a helicopter taking off showed it's ascent from at least 10 different angles - outside looking up, inside looking out, inside looking inside, outside different angle etc etc.Every character must have had at least two shots of them silent screaming from the Dummies Guide to filming internal angst.Things aren't explained, geography is not established and you can almost feel the makers telegraphing their contempt to the audience that 'if you don't get this, you're too stupid'.It's not engaging, thought provoking or entertaining. And when it's finished all you can contemplate is the utter pointlessness of the whole film.I know many complain of studio execs interfering with a film but you really have to question who greenlit this laughable project or signed off the finished product for general release.Whoever it was can't tell the difference between a movie and a flickerbook of cool filtered Instagram pics.",negative
Monsters: Dark Continent,"Just saw the Empire Magazine Premiere of this film at the aptly named Empire Leicester Square. As with a with other London Film Festival offerings a brief introduction normally with a few words from the director, and the odd actor or screenwriter was done. The introduction was kicked off by scruffiest person I have seen all year from Empire Magazine (to be fair to him he did admit as much) Then there was a vote of thanks by the director Tom Green who then proceeded to, I exaggerate not, thank EVERY person involved in the movie (I wondered what the end credits were for) this went on forever it seemed. All the films stars were paraded on the stage all suited and booted and all MALE. That aside I settled down to watch the film. First let's go back to the Empire Magazine guy who ""warns"" that this film was a war move. Back to the film It starts off with our ""heroes"" involved in a conflict with insurgents in the Middle East and spends the ENTIRE film as a war movie with the Monsters in the background. We were warned remember? Now I thought war movie in the context of he title Monsters meant Alien vs. Humans not war movie as in Hurt Locker. So you can gather by now that I did not like the movie, the acting was so clichéd it hurt, the script and dialogue was all over the place and it tried to be too many things at the same: War movie, Sci-Fi, War Movie, Drama, War Movie, Action, War Movie, Road Movie, War Movie (did I say war movie?). I do not go into this film expecting to watch, wait for it a WAR MOVIE. I have seen else where on this site that this film is better than the first one. IT IS NOT, the original was not exactly a flawless piece or work, but its main appeal was that it was made on a shoestring budget with a director's vision, wit and a wing and a prayer. This film was empty and for all the bullets flying around was frankly quite boring. It only lit up when the Monsters of the title Remember? Appeared. To be brutality honest THE MONSTERS were this film's BEST ACTORS. To be fair to this film, and I'm really trying to be, the monster effects were excellent. But the monsters had very little airtime, it looked like the creatures had other engagements and had no time to remains in this particular movie!",positive
We Are What We Are,"I saw this movie at a free sneak preview. So the cost of admission was 0 but the real cost was 2 hours of my life I'll never get back. This is a 'horror' film about ritual cannibalism. Thats not the problem, there are many good films about cannibalism in the horror and comedy genres. This is not a good film in any genre, nor is it bad enough to be a cult classic. The acting by the two young female leads is quite good and hopefully this film will be a minor footnote in their careers. The plot line is interesting although the premise gets pretty thin the minute you start thinking it through. What is the problem - it is SLOW, really really SLOW. Also, the violence and horror is gratuitous and graphic. It is slasher porn against women. (Why only women, why not men?) I don't know if this is really a spoiler but the graphic final event is shocking only in the activity, because otherwise it is a completely ridiculous moment. The action is so repellent it shuts off the natural instinct to laugh at an otherwise stupid scene. The director should have stuck to a basic premise of a fundamentalist serial killer living in a community and a family that is either ignorant of or traumatized by him. That would make sense. But adding graphic cannibalism made a potentially good film into a stupid film. Is this a good teenage date movie? Not really - its really really slow and those slasher scenes come over half way through the film. Skip this film and download Delicatessan or Fried Green Tomatoes - those two hours of your life won't be wasted watching either.",negative
We Are What We Are,I almost didn't watch this because of all of the reviews saying how gloomy and slow paced this film was. I'm glad I decided to take a chance on it. Had a great unexpected jaw dropping ending! Did not feel like this was slow paced at all and stayed glued to the story throughout the entire film.,positive
Howl,"A story on stranded train passengers in the middle of the forest at the wee end of the night against unknown blood thirsty creatures makes for a good horror story on paper but when it comes to translating it into a creature feature, screenwriter/director has failed big time. A very predictable cliché-ridden screenplay with utterly boring action sequences in which none of the characters on the screen garners viewer's interest/sympathy, making it a very dull affair. The film is filled with such ridiculously unbelievable stupid characters/moronic moments from starting frame to the end frame that it's not even comes closer to those films which are so bad that it's good category. This film needs its own category in terms of how awful a creature feature can go.There are hardly any redeeming qualities that I could find in this unadulterated pathetic excuse for a film of epic proportion.",negative
Howl,"Werewolves on a train! What's not to like about that?! A bunch of varied commuters get stranded on a broken down late night train in the middle of the woods. After the driver disappears, they try to walk up the tracks they soon regret it - something is out there and it wants in! This creature feature totally does what it says on the tin - scary as hell monsters, believable characters from different background fighting to live through the night - plenty of gore but loads of fun too. A real stand out bad guy performance from Elliot Cowan as a psycho banker determined to survive. Great comic relief too from Amit Shah as a nerdy accountant who turns out to be surprisingly handy in a fight! Great cameos from Sean Pertwee, Rosie Day and Duncan Preston. Recommended.",positive
The Super,"When Val Kilmers character tries to stop the little girl which is clearly pure evil, then a resident lady hits him and thereby stops Vals character from performing some sort of excorcism, and the evil is saved??? But when the little girl is clearly and obviously evil, why stop Vals character???
It doesnt make any sense?
The whole ending by the way doesnt make sense.",negative
The Super,"The Super is a mystery thriller that features Val Kilmer in a great supporting role that I just saw at a film festival. The movie is about Phil Lodge and his two daughters that move into an apartment building in New York. Phil also works there as a superintendent with several colleagues. Among them is Walter, played by Val Kilmer, who seems a bit off and the the residents start disappearing...The movie takes a simple concept but gives it a nice and welcome twist that caught me by surprise. I don't want to spoil anything here but I really enjoyed it. The movie is quite dark and also has a couple of scares but it is not really a horror film I would say. More of a mystery thriller with some gore. There is some great camera-work and directing there and I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of John Patrick Flueger in the future.",positive
V/H/S/2,"One night, my friends and I were discussing the V/H/S series, and one of them happened to mention thinking about streaming the sequel. Having seen the first one (and being left unsatisfied with it), I decided to check this one out so I could give her my opinion on it. I haven't been more repulsed and let down by a film.To start, the story line outside of the tapes is pretty much the same as the first movie's. There couldn't be another way for someone to discover the tapes? There's still not a way to connect all the tape stories together? That aside, my biggest problem with the movie is that the horror is not smart. There's no real psychological manipulation or realistic monsters. It's all just jumpscares and blood splashing around, because some filmmakers are still under the impression that abrupt loud noises and bodily injuries are scary.The detectives in this film discover four tapes. One guy gets an eye transplant that lets him see ghosts...the only thing cool about this one was the POV being just like a first-person view. He meets a woman with similar abilities, and then they have sex to techno music and that's never explained properly. The next tape is about a guy who gets turned into a zombie in the woods, then he eats some people, then they eat some people at a child's birthday party, then the guy kills himself. A pattern in these tapes is that a normal person encounters something weird, pokes it instead of fleeing, and then everybody dies. Every tape ends the same, so there's absolutely no element of fear from not knowing what to expect. What's to expect? Everybody's going to get murdered, just by a different monster.The next tape, I was absolutely enthralled by for the first while...it focuses on a group of documentary filmmakers who enter a cult accused of child abuse. I was so hooked to this one, until the first jumpscare. Then it escalates into a bizarre series of events, starting with children drinking poison, to people turning into zombies, to a really bad goat suit bursting out of a woman half its size. I've never seen so much potential completely immolated halfway through.The last tape at least had one funny bit where a group of kids burst in on a couple making out, but before I could even finish laughing, the Monster of the Day made a foghorn noise. (These aliens also looked like Slenderman with a cartoon alien's face, pincher hands, and chest hair.) This short features ten-year-olds saying the f-word, a child almost drowning, a preteen boy masturbating on screen, and a puppy falling from a great distance that dies slowly while gazing sadly into the camera. That wasn't clever, that was needlessly sick. The maker of this short was probably trying to assert how daring and edgy they were, but it just made me want to noogie them and shove their head in a toilet.The main tape ended with a woman turning into the girl from The Ring and a guy had an obviously fake dislocated tongue. I've got nothing.As a final film fart, the credits end with the same thing the first movie did...a choppy recap with obviously manmade glitches set to something that sounds like early 1990s punk rock. After that, the technical credits are a way creepier text-on-black set to tape hiss. As I thought after the first movie, you couldn't just keep up the creepy mood and use the black credits? You thought the obnoxious not- quite-dubstep really added something?What a complete disappointment. There was so much feedback on the first movie that the filmmakers could have learned from in this instalment, but they just did the exact same thing before, with old and new faults. This is one of the top five worst movies I've ever seen. If you liked the first movie, don't watch this. If you didn't like the first movie, don't watch this. If your sense of horror and humour are completely distorted, watch this, and then make an appointment with your doctor.",negative
V/H/S/2,"S-VHS is the follow up to last year's V/H/S, and features a new compilation of horror shorts from different directors. The main story is about two private investigators who are hired to find a missing college student. After breaking into his house, they find it empty, only with a pile of TV's and VHS tapes, which have ""WATCH"" written on them.This movie is shorter than the first one, but it's for the best, and whereas the first had 6 tapes, this one has 5, but each of them are better than the one's from the original.The tapes are shot in a POV style, and all of them include crazy things like aliens, zombies, demons, etc.REVIEW OF THE TAPES (IN ORDER OF Appearance):TAPE 47: Two investigators search for a missing student, and after breaking into his house, they start watching the VHS tapes that they find. The story still can't explain how the tapes ended up there, but you have to just forget about that, so it get's a 6/10CLINICAL TRIALS: This short is about a man who has replaced his eye with a cyborg-robot eye, and, for quality measures, the company of the eye decides to record what it sees for ""quality checks"". Things go very, very wrong when the eye starts recording ghosts of people around the house. This tape relies on jump-scares and is fun and scary at the same time, and includes a good underwater scene, so it get's a 7/10A RIDE IN THE PARK: This one is definitely the most innovating one and is about a biker that's riding his bicycle with a GoPro helmet, which has a camera. Soon, a zombie outbreak occurs and trying to rescue a woman, the biker gets bit and falls to the ground. He then ""wakes up"" and the rest of the tape is the zombie biker chasing and killing people, along with the rest of the horde. This one has a very cool scene where the biker storms a birthday party and starts biting the crap out of everyone, so it get's a good score of 8.5/10SAFE HAVEN: Alright, so this is the tape that you payed to watch. It is about an Indonesian film crew who is shooting a documentary about a mysterious cult that lives in the country side. The cult leader allows them to record, and soon, s*** hits the fan. I'm not going to tell you much about this one, because you just have to see it for yourself, because not only is this tape the best in S-VHS AND V/H/S, as it's one of the best short, modern-horror films that has been made. You may be thinking that this is just my opinion, but if you go read the critics reviews, they all say the same. Safe Haven constantly makes you feel uncomfortable and disturbed, as through the film, more gore and hideous creatures are shown, including a monster than will be burnt into your brain for years. Safe Haven is the longest tape in S-VHS, running through 40 minutes, but it's definitely worth a watch, and it's probably the reason the Blu-Ray will be bought for. Safe Haven gets a 10/10SLUMBER PARTY ALIEN ABDUCTION: Alright, if there was an Oscar for ""Best Movie Title"", this one would win. Not only is the title of this tape awesome, as the actual tape has some pretty spectacular scenes. SPAB is about a group of 13-year-old kids that are left alone with their big sister and her boyfriend at their lodge while their parents are gone for the day and night. This tape is the most spectacular. This tape is shot through a very uncommon way: the kids strap around a camera to their dog, and he records the kids doing things like building skate ramps and provoking their sister. Things go bad when creatures from outer space storm the lodge and everything gets noisy and crazy, with the creatures chasing the kids, while the dog is barking and going crazy. This one is easily the coolest and had the most ""WHAT THE F*** WAS THAT?"" moments, so it get's a 9/10VERDICT:S-VHS improves so much on the first one, not only on the quality of the tapes, as it removes most of the uninteresting stuff like the stupidity of some characters of the first movie. This is an anthology film, so character development can't be fully explored, but it's a good mix of adrenaline, fear and just pure fun, so make sure you watch this movie with a couple of friends, and not people that are snobs to this kind of films. You may think that I was overreacting with the ""Safe Haven"" segment, but trust me, I'm not. It is the best short horror film, and is the segment that you would think ""Damn, I wish that was an actual feature film"", so I'm pretty sure everyone will buy the movie just for that 40 minute film that's packed with scares, disturbing scenes and an incredible atmosphere that will make chills run through your spine.S-VHS gets an incredible score of 8.5/10",positive
Intruders,"*Warning Spoilers in this review* I was thoroughly disappointed with this movie. The reason I'm calling it a bait and switch is because the trailer was so promising but the movie was terrible. This is not a horror movie. It is a drama/thriller and the only serial killer died in the beginning of the movie. I was really hoping for some good kills in this movie especially because there is a serial killer lair in the basement! Anne is pathetic. The trailer makes her look like a badass, but sadly she is not. However, the actress who played Anne did a great job of playing a timid woman who suffers from agoraphobia. This is basically a Hallmark movie that should have been titled ""From my father's ashes. - the story of a woman who overcame PTSD & agoraphobia by killing some bad guys."" I would have given this movie a 1 star but I really liked the woman who played Anne. So if you're into really slow burning movies with a feel good ""you go girl!"" ending, then this is your movie! But if you want to watch a real horror movie, skip this one.",negative
Intruders,"I randomly saw this movie while watching TV at home. I was pleasantly surprised. The plot was engaging and twisted. Remind you, I had not seen the trailer and knew nothing about it. I laughed so hard each time timid, petite little Anna annihilated one of those douche bags. I rooted for the female protagonist and she turned out to be quite the twisted little badass. And crazy as heck, but somehow, you still sympathize with her. Once she gets the upper hand its on! I loved the look on each one of those jerks faces when she pummeled them. That basement with all of its hidden quirks was also entertaining. For a channel surfing movie, it Rocked!",positive
Starry Eyes,"I say sort of because the film has an unnerving and tense momentum, with some truly freaky and horrifying (good horrifying) images and scenes. It's kind of obvious where the film is going though, but it has some clever direction and again, disorienting in a good way in some of its pacing and tone. The lead actress is really good, very unnerving. The problem is that the film also has these weak spots here and there, and I wish the last 15 minutes had at least tries to do a bit more than what we regularly get from horror films like this. Still, it's actually quite a nice surprise in some of the things it does. This is actually recommended.",negative
Starry Eyes,"Struggling young actress / Big Taters waitress gets an audition for a production company of some renown, but ultimately must choose to sell her soul or stick with her friends - with room to consider secret (film) societies, porn, modern media, drug abuse and such. A crude version of an age old story that will pop up anywhere near and around high concentrations of power, money, showbiz, what have you. Does it work?Partly. The cast do a decent job, Alex(andra) Essoe first of all. But of all the many crazy representatives of evil throughout the history of film, Louis Dezseran is not one who leaves a lasting impression. His two casting minions are much better, even if memories of David Lynch' 'Mullholland Drive' and 'Inland empire' immediately come to mind...The story is supposedly a slow burner (reminiscent of 'The house of the devil', which is much better), but it takes way too much time to my taste to get to its point. On the drama level, it did not get under my skin somehow; the group of friends who want to become actors or otherwise involved in the world of film, are pretty much an uninspiring bunch, I suppose. And to really get (and stay!) connected with the 'wanderings' of Sarah, was yet another problem.And then there's the gore, which makes the movie what it truly is: a horror movie - but that takes a while. In the end the violence réally takes off, even if there are just a few moments here and there earlier on. The moment where one of the girls falls flat on her face causing Sarah to expose a sadistic side of her, was one of the rare moments that fully worked, actually.5 out of 10; certainly not the intelligent horror some reviews caused me to anticipate.",positive
The Lazarus Effect,"The Lazarus Effect (2015) ** (out of 4) A group of scientist discover a formula that could help bring the dead back to life. The main scientist Frank (Mark Duplass) and his fiancé (Olivia Wilde) mess up when signing their contract and end up getting kicked out of the laboratory. Needing to get enough of their records to carry on, the group sneak back into the lab but after an accident Frank's fiancé is killed. They decide to use the formula to bring her back to life but things don't go as planned.THE LAZARUS EFFECT has a few interesting ideas and some great performances, which keep it from being a complete trainwreck but there's no question that the film doesn't take its subject serious enough to have the film work. There's no question that there are elements of FLATLINERS here but people will also be thinking of LUCY, which was released the previous year as this film.It should be noted that without the end credits this movie runs just 76 minutes, which is extremely short in today's time. I personally love shorter movies but this one here is just so uneven that the film pretty much ends just as you feel it should be taking off. I say that because there are some interesting ideas about Heaven and Hell here but sadly very few of them are fully explored because once the fiancé is brought back to life the film turns into a rather generic horror movie. I'm not sure why the screenplay would introduce such good idea but then not do anything with them and especially since the film is so short and could have been expanded on.The performances in the film is what save it and help carry the material. Both Duplass and Wilde are very good and especially believable in their roles. Supporting players Sarah Bolger, Evan Peters and Donald Glover are also very good. Technically speaking the film features a nice score, good cinematography and the director certainly makes a professional looking film. With that said, THE LAZARUS EFFECT completely falls apart during the final fifteen minutes, which is a real shame.",negative
The Lazarus Effect,"I've long stopped going to horror movies expecting to get scared, or see anything remotely decent. Instead I view them as comedy movies, trying to entertain myself by how bad the films are, so it's pretty safe to say my expectations when seeing a horror movie are about as low as it gets and yet ""The Lazarus Effect"" still left me astonished by just how bad, uninteresting and not even remotely scary it was. There was nothing new or unique about the movie, and literally the only aspect of the movie that could be considered scary (if you're not already desensitized to those, like most people) were the jump scares, and even those were predictable.I've been disappointed by a lot of movies, but this is thee first time it was bad enough that I actually took the time to write out a review.",positive
Down a Dark Hall,"I read this book a long time ago and I still have the original paperback version. The book is amazing and scares you in subtle ways, whereas the movie wastes too much time with the antagonism between characters and very little on what the story is supposed to be about. They changed the movie so much that it is unrecognizable from the book, and the casting is way off. I've waited years for a decent movie version of this book and alas, it seems I'm going to have to keep waiting. My advice? Skip the movie, read the book. You won't be sorry.",negative
Down a Dark Hall,"Saw at the theater today. Really enjoyed it. Not your typical teen horror film. Had great acting, atmosphere, cinematography, and sound design. Even gave me a couple jumps, but that's not what this film is ultimately about. Would have been a 10/10 if the second act was a little more developed and had a stronger friendship/relationship between the girls. Thought the adults, Uma Thurman and the actress that played Kit's mom were great. At first I thought Uma Thurman's accent was going to throw me, but ended up liking it. This film has a cool concept at the end. Be patience. But may not be great for those with short attention spans, ADD, or lack of depth. Definitely not your typical teen movie, nor is it your typical horror film. Has an artsy feel to it and could be something that gets more attention later as these actresses careers take off.",positive
Little Evil,"There's very ""little"" good to say about this snore-fest. It tries to be funny but falls flat at every turn. Even the great, villainous Clancy Brown as the evil cult leader couldn't salvage this train wreck. The morbidly obese lesbian ""AL"" character dropped the F-Bomb every other word and was incredibly irritating as she called every male ""Bro!"" (in between F-Bombs). The mother was completely oblivious to the fact her son had brought complete destruction to all those around him, especially slaughtering former husbands and boyfriends. And the step-dad took forever and a ton of prodding to be convinced the kid (Lucas) was actually the anti-Christ.
And then, after being tortured and buried alive by Lucas, the step-dad gets chewed out by the mom for not caring for the emotional well-being of the pint-sized, psychotic, satanic little monster!?! Yeah, then the step-dad has some unequivocally idiotic change of heart and decides he's gonna love this murderous demon ""because you don't have to be like your real dad"" or some kinda BS even though Lucas has ALREADY committed countless atrocities and deaths! It ends on an even cheesier, dumb note that I won't even bother to explain. If you want a funny, scary movie you'd be much better served watching ""Army of Darkness"" again.",negative
Little Evil,"This film is hilariously entertaining if you recognize the intended allusions, particularly the nods to THE OMEN. Adam Scott and Owen Atlas are charming as step-father and son, especially in the water park scenes. Evangeline Lilly is surprisingly perfect as the ditsy mom; she delivers her lines with impeccable comic timing. I've never seen her outside of LOST and her performance here is spot-on. Yes, some bits are campy and silly, but the overall message is touching and relevant.",positive
Hell Fest,"Please, do not watch this movie. The only positive thing about this film is the set design. The rest is absolutely lazy filmmaking full of jumpscares and dialogue which sounds as if it came from someone who never spoke to a different human being. It ruined a decent premise and is just a huge waste of time. Please do not watch this piece of dull garbage.",negative
Hell Fest,"Just got home from seeing it. I love thursday night early showings! Got to see it without a crowd. I'm a seasoned horror fan so the fact this didn't scare me doesn't mean anything. Not much scares me. The fact that the suspense and tension were felt throughout and kept me wanting to see what happens next, thats a good accomplishment. I was pretty impressed with this flick.A great addition to the slasher genre, I hope there are sequels. I don't want to give anything away but will say it had a great 80s/90s slasher feel to it, I loved some of the tropes included, it made if fun. It does start off a little slow but once it takes off you're in for a hell of a ride!",positive
One Cut of the Dead,"I just seen movie at ToHorror Festival, also with subtitle is an incredible movie, for everyone like horror, like to see backstage of movie, or work in this mad world.
It's very difficult to talk about this movie without doing spoiler, but i try to do it.
Acting : terrible enough to be enjoyable, and right to very realist
Shooting : double Dop for a double feature, both work fine to obtain the right result, a funny horror result.
Direction is very complex and i think Directors did a great work.
If like horror you must see it, without reading more about plot, to avoid to waste the suspence. Great Movie",negative
One Cut of the Dead,"Absolutely incredible! Who would have thought a zombie flick could be so unique, original and wildly entertaining - and that it could sidetrack you with the most audacious curve ball that will knock you out the park and some (twice). Perseverance is the key, the best things are always worth waiting for and this is one of those occasions where the reward will leave you agog at the genius, originality and imagination conjured up. Brilliant!!!",positive
Curse of Chucky,"Curse of Chucky is better than most horror movies that get a theatrical run. The staging is rather small, with a small unknown cast and a limited location, but they make the absolute best of everything they have. Brad Dourif, the original director, and another important cast member from parts 4 and 5 appear; and this movie actually seems like a return to the formula of the original movies, using some of the surprise and humor of the last two. A woman caring for a disabled daughter, and living in a lovely Gothic mansion, receives the Chucky doll anonymously. After being quickly dispatched, the rest of the family arrives to take over the estate from the daughter. Among them is a little girl, who adopts the Chucky doll. The parents of the girl seem to have ulterior motives and a strange relationship with their babysitter, which is later revealed as a pleasant and humorous twist. Chucky begins killing off the victims, using the creepy mansion as a great backdrop. The camera work is great. The suspense is good. There are some great kills. This movie does not look cheap. Its only VOD concession seems to be that it sticks to the same location over the same night, and changes settings only rarely. The last entry seems to largely avoid parts 4 and 5, although it does not erase them completely. Often, horror movies that deviate from formula come out disastrous, but Chucky reinvented itself as a series with Bride and Seed of. Fans of those movies may be disappointed this doesn't pick right up where they left off. Still, it's a nice surprise to go back to the pure cheesy formula horror of the first three movies. The ending, of course, leaves room for a sequel that could play off the theme of the movie, and revisit dangling threads from the earlier series. Well worth renting, streaming, buying.",negative
Curse of Chucky,"Do NOT underestimate this movie. Just because it's going straight-to-DVD does not mean it will be ""another terrible sequel"". This movie contains twists, gore, and so much scare, you will most likely jump out of your seat more than once. AND not only will this movie have you begging for another, this movie will PROMISE you another. Chucky has been around since the 80's but now it's time for a revamp. And while some of the Chucky models especially in this movie might look a tad awkward, this doll will eventually evolve into one of the most horrifying icons that has startled people for decades. Chucky is back, better than ever, and one hell of a killer doll!",positive
The Sacrament,"Wow...I can't believe this movie averages 6 stars. I went into it thinking something scary was going to happen. Halfway through, I realize the plot is pretty much Jim Jones and Jonestown. ""Ok,"" I say to myself, ""maybe there is a plot twist and they all turn into zombies or something clever.""Nope. Basically whoever scripted this pile of crap plagiarized the Wikipedia page for Jamestown. , changed some names, added some Shakey-Cam, pretended like it was found footage, and added a terrible score.I was expecting a lot more. An actual documentary on The Jamestown Massacre is more terrifying than this movie. The saddest part of all is in the credits where, instead giving a tribute to the actual Jamestown Massacre victims, they continue with the fauxmentary falsehoods with the body counts and other BS about ""Eden Parish.""Save your time, avoid this movie.",negative
The Sacrament,"For those of you that are saying, ""You'd be better off watching 'Jonestown: Life and Death in the People's Temple.'"" I mean...you're not necessarily wrong, but saying so diminishes some of what I thought was really clever about this film: the found footage format.In Guyana (as they say multiple times in the documentary you are all so well defending), Jim Jones talked all the time over the loudspeaker and TAPED everything. I think the found footage angle on this film pays an interesting tip of the hat to that aspect of Jonestown life. The reason we know so much about what happened in the massacre is: A. The congressmen brought a film crew with him and we have footage from them and B. Jim Jones audio-taped the mass suicide. Those that survived the shooting at the airstrip took the film with them. The audiotape was discovered at the site of the massacre. (Therefore, it's not really problematic that in this film, one of the cameras was left behind). Did I feel like the FF angle felt forced at times? Of course! But I've seen it done WAY more awkwardly in other films, I just have to give this one credit. I thought the movie was inspired and paid tribute to many Jonestown victims throughout(i.e. the guy speaking out against Father in the meeting, the note slipped to the media). It's really hard to recreate something so tragic without feeling campy, especially in the horror genre and I think they did a good job. I do wish that (as in Guyana), a few of the cult members actually survived and escaped with them, I'm not terribly sure why they chose to eradicate everyone. But...in all, I enjoyed it.",positive
The Bar,"A Spanish competition entry at Berlin, 2017, THE BAR, (El Bar) directed by Black comedy ace Alex de la Iglesia, is set completely in a bar in central Madrid then in the city sewers underneath. This is a black comedy -- at least it starts out that way -- but ends up as a most unfunny horror film with a prolonged nightmare coda in the shitty sewers of the city. At the outset two bar customers are strangely shot down leaving the bar and then their bodies disappear along with a pool of blood on the pavement just outside the entrance. The remaining customers within, including a very pretty young woman are freaked out and afraid to leave, especially when it turns out that there is some sort of deadly virus out there. This then becomes a nightmare something like Buñuel's ""Exterminating Angel"" as the people within become more and more animal like and start killing one another off, or trying to. The escape through the sewers reminded me of Wajda's Kanal but without any rhyme or reason. Pure bludgeoning of the senses. Little else. Mr. de la Iglesia made one of the funniest black comedies of all time, ""The Ferpect Crime"" (obviously imperfect) back in 2006. I was strongly looking forward to more of the same here in Berlin but stopped chuckling after the first ten minutes and was basically in agony for the rest of the picture. To be avoided like the plague and there actually is some kind of unidentified plague threatening the world in this suffocating appalling story.image3.jpegTrapped like rats in Alex de la Iglesias' Nightmare Madrid BAR",negative
The Bar,"I had no idea what i was in for. What a journey, psychological thriller with amazing actors, especially the drunk guy. At times it became a dark comedy.
There is never a dull moment in this movie about the choices one makes to survive, how your human nature and self flaws makes you act and react to others.
I absolutely loved the movie, the pace, the acting, the rush, the trill, i got involved in their actions.

Friend Request,"I'm a huge fan of horror. Generally, I'll watch every horror film that released in theater, so last night I went to see Friend Request. I didn't know it was opening night either and there were about 6 other people there. I walked in a couple minutes late during the intro sequence and found myself confused as I watched about three to five minutes of Facebook snapshots set to weird pop music. The movie then started, I guess, and that feeling of confusion never subsided. It got right into the plot and completely skipped any character development. I didn't care at all whether the lead character, or any other character in the film for that matter, lived or died. I didn't understand the motivation of the antagonist and it wasn't ever really explained. Apparently she was a witch or something similar and had magical powers for some reason. She wanted to kill all of the main characters friends for no reason other than she felt lonely, I think. I don't even know. The ending was even more jumbled and nonsensical. By the time the credits rolled, nothing was explained whatsoever. This was by far the worst film I've seen in theaters in recent memory. In fact, I don't remember ever seeing anything worse.

Friend Request,"Since Unfriended last year we have Friend Request. Now, having seen this on IMDb listed as a ""Thriller"" I wasn't bought. Considering the film looked & sounded like a horror film I wasn't as excited as I was for Unfriended. Though that didn't deter me entirely! I then began to see trailers of the film in cinema & was sure it was a horror considering how creepy it looked, even still it was listed as a Horror on the Odeon website & I made plans to see it! I would've seen it anyway it looked that good!So, the film is about a girl named Laura who befriends a eccentric dark girl named Marina, who has no friends & is very quiet. She has a weird Facebook profile & begins to get clingy with Laura who is her 1 & only friend. But after a conflict Laura unfriends Marina & things go from bad to worse a dark presence begins to stalk Laura & make her lonely after Marina kills herself!My thoughts are that this film was really twisted & f*#ked up! It really grabs you & locks you into this deep dark twisted underworld of the internet & how making one error can have devastating effects on you & your life! It was really dark & made Unfriended seem tame in comparison!The kills were pretty good & sinister! The possession-on-the- internet theme was really scary & close to home as I use Facebook & the internet myself! It really gives that what if feel! I also liked the grimness of the film as a whole! It felt dark & really dreary which added to the atmosphere! Creepy parts of the film like the footage of the kills of Laura's friends appearing on her account & her friends unfriending her thinking she's the one posting them, I liked how it was done when the spirit was trying to turn everyone against Laura! It was a pretty good flow to the story!I overall thought this was a really good film & really dark & sinister to the core! You'll not be disappointing! 10/10",positive
Don't Knock Twice,"What a load of rubbish.The horror genre is riddled with bad movies, and is an arena most fresh film directors like to enter, as it is fairly straightforward and doesn't require the same skills a serious drama does. The problem is: to make a really good horror, you do need a lot of skills. Whoever made this had no idea what they were doing. The script is lazy and predictable, with one overused cliché after another. It's so tedious and frustrating. And then there's this ridiculous premise with an interracial couple... Guess what race the girl is? No surprise there.This film is absolute bottom.",negative
Don't Knock Twice,"I had seen the cover of this movie as a related item on a few horror films and thought the plot was intriguing. Then I saw the Blu Ray was on sale at Walmart, which is actually interesting because it was accidentally stocked two months ahead of its release date. But I didn't complain as I took it home ready for what I was hoping would be a good spooky horror movie night. I wasn't disappointed. Despite the negative reviews, this ended up being one of the better horror treats from IFC Midnight and one of the best overall horror films in recent memory. -Plot- Chloe is somewhat estranged from her ex-addict mother Jess for the beginning of her life. But now a more stable and wealthy Jess wants to reconnect with her daughter. But before happily ever after could happen, Chloe and a friend had gone to a local neighborhood house where urban legend says a vengeful witch resides. The legend states that if you knock on her door twice, she will come and take you to her world. Well, they knocked twice. That is just the basic plot that sums up the first 5 minutes. Its a typical genre plot, but it is done surprisingly well. I am appalled by the negative scores. This is better than your average scary movie. The mythos is very creepy. The acting is above average for the genre and budget. The directing and cinematography contain some beautiful and terrifying imagery. The musical score is an instant horror classic. The sound design altogether is intense. The trailer for this surprisingly doesn't give away even half of the scares so even seeing it beforehand wont ruin any of it. But the trailer doesn't help its case either. There are plenty of jump scares that will truly get to you. Some might call them lazy, but their just nit picky. The entity of the witch is truly horrifying and will have you reaching for a blanket or light switch in all of its on screen moments. The actor playing the witch entity is the same that played the scary ""mama"" entity from Mama and the emaciated demon at the end of REC, so you know you're in for some scary imagery with this guy. The mythos of the movie does get a little over indulgent toward the end, but it still works well, despite a somewhat rushed ending and typical horror movie ""bad logic"" by some characters. Id compare some of the scary moments to ""Lights Out"" and even one early sighting of the witch to the Nun painting scene in ""The Conjuring 2"". I am surprised this didn't get a nationwide theatrical release as its production value is pretty nice looking compared to nationwide horror craps like Bye Bye Man. I attribute its absence from cinemas to its lack of a recognizable star. Which is unfortunate since I would have loved to experience this on the big screen. But that's what makes the horror genre so special. Even little gems like this that are ignored by mainstream media can end up being big cult classics and I believe this is a candidate. I am a horror junky and don't scare that easily anymore, but the entity of the witch really got to me. I really found myself inching toward the light switch and looking to see if something was behind me multiple times. One of the few films in a long time that I had trouble watching in the dark entirely during my first viewing. I would even go as far as to say this is a more accessible and fast paced take on A24s period horror ""The Witch"". I think the negative reviews will surely get lost in praise as this finds its audience. I gave it a 10/10 to do my small part in helping its score improve, but my real grade would be maybe a 8.5/10. Its truly much better than the trailer suggest and definitely better than the negative reviews say. If you want a good fright night with a lover or friends, or even alone, then this is a perfect choice. If you liked ""Lights Out"" or ""The Conjuring"" style horror then beware you're in for a scare. Just make sure its dark and the volume is high. I'm adding this to my go to Halloween season movie playlist.",positive
Gantz: O,"Gantz was a good read as a manga because you could skip trough the lamer parts and just view is as a pure action title - which was its strongest part. The fights were entertaining, the art was lovely dark, some of the ideas were actually decently original and the gory 'live or die' policy gave the series a nice feel. This 3DCGI movie on the other hand doesn't really deliver any of that. It does have very successful 3D design and for once the CGI doesn't look too awkward either. Definitely a better pic for that matter than Space Pirate Captain Harlock or Final Fantasy Kinsglaive. As an adaptation, for person like me who is familiar with all of these source materials, I have to say Gantz doesn't work as a stand alone title at all. So others shouldn't bother and Gantz fans will be pleased to some extend at least? I am not sure about that either. This movie is the least mature take on the Gantz franchise for sure. Much like with Berserk Golden Age Arc movies (yes, not the new hideous series, but the movies) - this series seems now like a shonen title aimed for teens while it is originally meant to be mature content for adults. Other than few blood spats and Berserk sex scenes, you will not find much mature and brutal content in them. Some would agree those won't work with CGI well, so it is better not to even try.That leaves me to the question, who is the target audience for this title? I guess the fact that Netflix got it soon after release widely, implies how niche audience we are talking about. On the other hand, I would have never watched this movie if it hadn't been on Netflix recommendations. In the end, I will recommend this piece to everyone who enjoys cyberpunk.",negative
Gantz: O,"Gantz is one of my favourites ( or probably my favourite) manga ever. I've following Hiroya Oku ( the guy who created Gantz) work for years. When i knew about a new Gantz Film coming this year I was very excited but, at the same time, I didn't think that we could watch this film on theatres in Argentina. Well I was wrong, we could due anifest Latin America. What can I say about Gantz O? The animation is AMAZING. The best that i've seen for a long time. The fights, superb . Oka , ""George"" and Nobuo , members of the sadistic and cool Osaka team, have the best fights of the movie. The music fits really well. The Osaka mission is know as one of the best of the manga and it was a really clever choice to pick it up and make a movie about it. About Kato, he is the hero in this movie and you'll end loving him. And the aliens... they're bizarre, scary and really violent. Just like in the manga. To sum up, if you have the opportunity, watch it. Yeah, there're some missing characters, but this movie was so good, so entertaining, that you will forget that in seconds.",positive
Zombeavers,"Zombeavers follows the story of five friends on a nice weekend out on the lake when suddenly malicious beavers come into the mix, that's where things start to turn horrific. I haven't enjoyed as much absurdity in film in such a long time. I mean by first glance of this poster, you're probably thinking ""This looks like such a dumb movie"" and my god, you don't even know how right you are. This was a pretty bizarre film but for some odd reason, I actually really enjoyed it. Don't worry this was a pretty stupid movie but I really came across to having a enjoyable time. For starters, the film did have a pretty commonplace plot that was pretty inevitable to see happen. The design for the Beavers were so laughable for the design in general and for the film that made them more appealing to see be played out but it was kinda silly to make them be puppets. One thing that I found absurd and uncanny was whenever someone got bit from one of the Beavers, they would start to turn into this human like beaver with a giant, claws and even the buck teeth, I was really a sight for sore eyes but it was pretty obscure and very bizarre. The acting was a minimal risk for this type of film but I guess you could say it was pretty fair with some of it was a bit exaggerated at some parts. My favorite portion out of the whole film would have to be the John Mayer and Bill Burr cameos, even though their characters were a bit foolish, they still managed to bring in some ample humor to their characters. I think the makers of this film really knew what they were getting their selves into and basically knew it was going to be a absurd film. Overall, this was mainly a stupid film with the stupidity being on point with this type of campy horror film but you can mainly get a kick out of it for the most part. Some of you may hate this film, some of you may appreciate and have fun with it like I did. Either way, give these Beavers a chance.",negative
Zombeavers,My friend and I were legit totes having a bad day until we found this movie... It looked pretty interesting so we thought we would give it a go. We have never seen something so well put together in our entire lives! This is officially the best movie I have ever seen. I laughed so hard and also cried. It was a mix of both scary and funny. It was so funny when the girl screamed on the hood of the car oh my gosh I cried. But it was a good cry. My friend screamed so loud. It was hysterical. I recommend this to the rest of my sorority sisters for when they are having a bad day and just need to laugh it out. Also this girl teaches you how to give 2 good slaps to a cheatin' ex-no-good-hot boyfriend.,positive
13 Sins,"13 SINS is the American remake of the Thai horror film 13: GAME OF DEATH, which is well worth watching for anyone interested in the subject matter. It goes without saying that this remake is by far the inferior movie, although those who haven't seen the original might enjoy it regardless. The story is about a down-on-his-luck guy, struggling financially, who finds himself tasked with performing a series of tasks in return for money.The stakes start off low but gradually build to more and more extreme situations. The budget for the film is low but the events staged are quite convincing, although it's unfortunate that some of the better tasks from the Thai original are skipped over. The main actor isn't particularly good but Ron Perlman is effective as the dogged cop investigating the case. The usual gamut of shocking scenes, bad taste moments, and gore are enough to keep this little story watchable.",negative
13 Sins,"This is a wonderful critique of raw capitalism and the unquestioned reign of the 1% for those willing to see it. I recommend viewing this movie to anyone who can relate to the inhuman transformation we are all forced to go through in order to survive in so-constructed and firmly held objectivist societies.This movie deserves a cult following.The story is slow to start, but picks up later on. There isn't much bling, but a lot of substance to the story. The acting is solid. The story is intriguing. There is a plot twist. Other characters could have been fleshed out more for greater immersion, but the protagonist himself is well portrayed.I enjoyed watching this movie, but you should know my score is not based on the quality of the movie itself. I gave it a 10/10 because the underlying system critique resonated with me.",positive
The Blue Elephant,"The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world that ""The Blue Elephant"" is an excellent movie! I admire the cinematography so much also the directing and professional camera angles and views. Although It wasn't something so new to the creative director ""Marwan Hamed"" , he really excelled in directing this movie. but, unfortunately, he didn't manage to show us and makes us feel many deep feelings was supposed to be in the novel (which was silly, he didn't manage to transfer the character of *Lobna* and the complicated relation between *Dr.Yehia* her. It was supposed to be a sophisticated deep relation filled with sorrow and depression, and I didn't feel that. I wanted to see seductive spontaneous scenes between *Dr.Yehia* and *Maya*, like the novel, and I was shocked after I had watched all the scenes between them! there wasn't any seductive scenes only one spontaneous scene nevertheless it wasn't a bad scene. The soundtrack the music theme was splendid! it was really good which, also, wasn't something new to Hesham Nazeh. The whole movie falls at the scenario it was so bad, the novel itself was bad and weak and the end, to me, seemed to be a call to ignorance. The movie in compare with modern Arabic and Egyptian movie is a breakthrough even in the storyline, it calls to a new artistic movement in the Egyptian movies industry.",negative
The Blue Elephant,i really loved the movie i have read the novel about 2 years ago and i was waiting for the movie to come up i thought i am gonna get disappointed from the movie because this type of movie never been done in Egypt and the crew is young but there was one insuring thing that Ahmed mourad whose gonna write the movie it was excellent really enjoyed the movie and the length of the movie is perfect its filled with thriller and makes you think what is gonna to happened next takes your attention you wanna listen to every word so focused in it really it gives example to producers that good script and good stories always succeed. the best movie in the last 4years in Egypt.,positive
Flight 7500,"I usually like movies in plane but with a good story. This movie has only a plane and no story at all. Even plane is cheap CGI. All what had to be scary stuff is stupid screams, blue pale hands. Maybe this was scary 15 years ago but now is almost 2015. We saw crap like this many times before. There are some known actors (not mega actors but still known) in this movie where I think why the hell they went for this movie. Acting also is unbelievable. There is no explanation to this movie. It ends just as stupid as it started. Scream and credits here we come. Some reviewers here say it is entertaining. If this is entertaining than what is boring for those people? Really! Once again - Do not waste your time and money. Save yourself from this cheap film.",negative
Flight 7500,If you are one of those people who think the horror movie is supposed to be a long screaming run in the woods with a knife equipped maniac on your back then let it pass. This is no cheap thrill jump fest and you might be bored.If you think the true horror builds on suspense and should bring you an unexpected twist at the end you will love this. This is really deep Japanese style horror movie that will left you stunned in the end. The movie systematically builds the suspension using a lot of different false twists.Really recommended!,positive
Clown,"Even if you aren't bothered by clowns, you have to admit that a killer clown is a pretty creepy idea. I mean clowns are always around children, they have a pale face, goofy hair and bright welcoming colors, masking the homicidal tendencies underneath. I always thought it would make a good movie idea, and Clown is about the closest we get to that. It's less of a killer clown story as much as it is a possession movie. This particular clown suit does not come off. If someone puts it on, it fuses with their skin while the demon slowly possesses them. The demon is a cannibal and only eats children. 5 children to be exact: one for every month of winter, or so the lore goes. It's an interesting take on the killer clown notion and I usually like Eli Roth so I was excited to see this movie. Unfortunately, Clown misses the mark in almost every way.It's an Eli Roth movie so of course there's lots of blood and gore, which is fine. Eating kids is also inherently disturbing, even though the killing is not shown on screen you do see a lot of children's guts, blood and body parts. The thing is, it doesn't really add anything to the movie. That's mainly because the movie doesn't build up much tension in the first place. It's slow to start - the dad is the one who puts on the costume to surprise his kid at his birthday party, but he falls asleep in it and when he wakes up, he finds that the wig infused with his hair and the costume is indestructible. The psychological aspect of this is interesting for a while, but it never goes the extra mile. Everything we see here has been done to death already. Just because the premise is cool doesn't mean cheesy dialogue and inappropriate jump scares get a free pass. They're still annoying as hell, and sadly they are littered throughout the entire movie.This movie has every horror cliché in the book. The jump scares in particular really detract from the movie's atmosphere. It sets a dark tone at the beginning, and even more so when the psychological elements start dripping in and the dad questions his sanity as he discovers more about the suit, but every once in a while someone will pop up behind someone else and the music will be LOUD for a second as if it's supposed to scare us. No, it doesn't work like that. All the good build up in the first two acts are dampened by these cheap scares - they give no time for tension to build before throwing another one at you, and it's just annoying after the first couple of times. The dialogue doesn't help either. Neither does the acting. Peter Stormare is great as usual but he doesn't get that much screen time. It's mainly the female lead and her reactions to her husband turning into this monster, and let me tell you, she is a terrible actress. There are also a lot of kids in this movie and kid actors are almost always terrible. You just don't care about any people on screen, except for the guy being possessed but even he is only in the first half of the movie. We're just stuck following a bland wife and her bland kid trying to stop the evil clown from killing other bland kids.The clown itself does not disappoint. It does look genuinely creepy, and the costume and make-up are very well done, but sadly that doesn't make up for a bad script and poor direction. It just has no style. It's really by-the-numbers horror with an Eli Roth tinge. The worst part is, it isn't even scary. If you're a fan of Eli Roth then you might get some enjoyment from this, but if you aren't a horror fanatic then don't bother.",negative
Clown,"No Spoiler alerts here! This movie was a good horror movie and playing on a character that a lot of people have phobias about makes it that much better. At the start, I was honestly feeling a cheesy, B movie type with a possible special appearance by the Dwight Johnson or Dolph Lundren :) The gore in the movie was top shelf and watching it with my wife and daughter (who are both scared of clowns) made it that much better and they absolutely loved it! And my daughter still slept in her own bed. I honestly don't know if there has been a horror movie with the main character of a clown that has been this good in the last 5-10 years, if I'm wrong please let me know of such movie. It was awesome how the story jumped feet first into the plot. Would love to see a prequel if it's done right .....Loved the gore!",positive
I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House,"As a lover of both horror and drama, this movie *should* be right up my alley. Unfortunately, it's one of the most boring films I've ever had the misery of sitting through. I paused it after what felt like 2hours, only to realize I was barely halfway through the movie...*SPOILERS*Lily Saylor is a timid, somewhat neurotic, woman, who for some inexplicable reason lives in a ""batty"" old woman's house for over a year, and quite literally has no life outside this. Her backstory about her broken engagement is awkwardly delivered, and is in service of nothing. As for the plot, there really isn't one. Three women have a vague connection to an old house, and none of it goes anywhere. A woman in the 1800's,Polly, who never has any dialogue or story, gets murdered.We never learn why. She played hide and seek with her...husband? In an empty house, and he kills her with a hammer. The old woman, tended to by Lily, spouts out random so-called poetic statements about Polly. It never goes anywhere or does any service to the story. Our ""heroine"", Lily, walks through the house, looking confused, for 90% of the movie, until she is literally scared to death by the sight of Polly's ghost. It's not a scary or intense moment, Polly just appears, dressed smartly and just staring into space. Much like the audience for this movie. The bet way to summarize the viewing experience of this movie, is to imagine that you're watching a pornographic video that lasts for 1h27m. During that time, the camera pans through the room where the action is supposed to happen, and rather than focusing on the actors, you get a blurry vision of someone who *might* be doing what you want to see, and a very nice zoomed in image of a chair. There's no action, of any kind, and in the end, neither the movie nor its audience, gets anywhere near a climax. Avoid like the plague, unless you have severe insomnia and you're in need of something even more boring than the political scenes from the Star Wars prequels...",negative
I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House,"This movie is not for those who are used to fast paced, break neck horror. This is more for those who are familiar with and enjoy Gothic literature. If you don't enjoy penny dreadfuls or the dark romantics, you will not enjoy this movie. (Not to say there's anything wrong with that, everyone has their own tastes. I'm just saying this movie won't be for you.) If you aren't watching closely enough, you may miss important details. I understand why this movie is getting negative reviews, because people came in wanting one thing and left with another. But, the movie itself is beautiful. It's color palette and cinematography are to die for, and the writing in the movie is superb. The acting is just on the right side of subtle, and the quiet atmosphere really drew me into a false sense of security, only to push me out of my comfort zone.The story, at it's core., is about Polly Parsons, a young bride who is murdered and 'buried' behind the walls of the home her husband built for her. She begins to tell her tale to writer Iris Blum, who turns it into a national best seller. Iris tries to communicate with the ghost again, only for Polly to go silent and literally turn her back on her. ""You turned your back so often, you're feet were facing the wrong way round."" Over the years, Iris deteriorates. She wants to die in her home, with Polly. Lily (yes, I did do the thing where I screamed ""oml dats my name."") comes in as her hospice nurse. Lily begins to uncover these stories, only to die of fright as soon as she sees Polly. She stays in the house, effectively becoming Polly. The symbolism in this movie is strong. No details are just put in there by accident. Iris and Lily, wilting like flowers. The mold that is Polly destroys them. *.* Like I said, if you enjoy the 'My House is Haunted By Demons' genre, but in the vein of 'The Amityville Horror' or 'Oujia' then maybe skip this one? (Of course, this isn't the only genre you're allowed to enjoy. You can enjoy this movie and those as well.) Otherwise, put your looking googles on. This gon' good.",positive
A Haunted House,"No, really. A Haunted House is basically another one of those unnecessary horror comedies that aims to make fun of the popularity of the first Paranormal Activity and The Devil Inside, which were done by making the movie look like found footage. With this film, I think it should have been rated NC-17 with its overload of sex scenes, as it has so many, it gets old real fast. Also, the film contains the usual toilet humor (which by now, is overkill), and even relies on using other bad jokes that sound like they were thrown in there to get some cheap laughs, as they are horribly written. This is a complete wastes of the talents of those involved (especially Cedrid The Entertainer) and I do not recommend this unless you are one of those people who find such content enjoyable.",negative
A Haunted House,"I loved this movie, I could go back to see it again. I laughed so hard. The comedy was refreshing, It's been a while since I can recall a movie that left me laughing like this movie did. It was a change from most recent movies based on drama (killings, kidnapping and etc...). I would tell anyone who likes to laugh this is the movie to see. It was nice to see Marlon Wayans independent from his family. I loved each and every character, Marlon Wayans, Essence Atkins and Cedric The Entertainer were fantastic in the movie, but if I have a favorite it would have to be ""Chip the Psychic"". Just sitting here writing this is making me laugh and think about the movie. Don't just take my word for it GO SEE IT!",positive

Holidays,"I went into this with high expectations, and while ""Halloween"" and ""Christmas"" (the ones I expected the most from) proved to be disappointments, I found the ""Father's Day"" segment brilliant, touching and also terrifying. The manner in which the story builds thru the playback of a childhood recording, how she drives out to the middle of nowhere, and the suspense leading to where she was headed, all great elements rounding out a truly unique segment. I found myself on the edge of my seat from the time she started the tape to the very end.""Easter"" was bizarre and interesting and ""St. Patty's Day"" was pretty unexpected but cool. ""St. Patty's Day"" felt like classic British horror or something. Very elegant, artistic and suspenseful. The little girl did a fantastic job. ""Christmas"" suffered from what many shot-in-LA indie productions experience which was the total lack of snow, thus creating a true ""Christmas"" atmosphere. It was an OK concept, but overall not really scary or exciting. And I feel like the gadget the story focuses on will really date it in 10-15 years and seem silly. And I felt like ""Halloween"" was a total wasted opportunity. With the ""Halloween"" setting they could have done so much, but other than it being centered around 3 girls stuck inside on Halloween, you wouldn't know it was set on Halloween. No pumpkins, no trick-r-treaters, no atmosphere what-so-ever. Seemed more like that story could have been molded into any of the ""Holidays"" and I wish that segment went to someone who really cared to do something cool with it, as that segment alone could have really brought this indie anthology into ""classic"" territory. ""Valentine's Day"" was a classic style shocker and ""Mother's Day"" was pretty creepy, but had a weak ending. I was really hoping for a cool ""Independence Day"" story or ""Thanksgiving"", but maybe it was for the best since there was really only a couple standout segments. Overall, well worth the watch, even if a handful of the stories are throwaway. I'd compare it to ""ABCs of Death"", with about the same ratio of good stories.",positive

With perfect timing, Henry delivers line after line without breaking character even to blink. He just went up several notches in my ""fav""actor category because of this movie.Add to it a well picked supporting cast, well thought out the script, great pacing and just the right touch of effects, we have a winner that should have been in the theaters.

Time Lapse,"On the first page of the IMDb reviews, people are showering it with praise with bullshit such as it being ""intelligent, smart and coherent"" which makes me wonder if they even know what these terms mean.First of all directing your ""future"" self to do things so that a camera today can reap the fruits of your label seems a bit too paradoxical, but okay fine, I will accept it, I'm open-minded enough.But then everything just goes from retarded to worse. Why would you need a crooked bookmaker to place your bets to begin with? It's not like that would be the only way to make tons of money.How can the painter not have inspiration, but his future self does? It makes no sense, but whatever, I'll again open my mind and accept it.And after what's-his-name kills the bookmaker and his goon, that girl acts completely ridiculous towards her boyfriend, I really despise lack of logic or just general stupidity.Then in the end ""what's-his-name"" learned from ""what's-her-name"" that altering the time-line doesn't incur death. You think? Really? Like maybe use the frigging internet to look up theories on alternate or parallel time-lines before you start acting like a retard and lock your supposed friend up in the basement.Supposed friend breaks free and manages to bluff ""what's-his-name"" into handing over his gun to the girl. Later on he manages to turn the tables around again and hits the gun out of his hands and never bothers to look behind him that hey maybe the girl heard their struggle and might be looking for a way to take matters into her own hand.And that right there was the point I just thought, quit it, this movie strives on stupidity. I should have turned it off earlier, but hey I had nothing else to do.I don't care for the low budget concept. The only thing low budget is the lacking amount of logic in this movie. Ugh.",negative
Time Lapse,"In some senses Time Lapse is a movie about time travel and all the paradoxes that would come in tow, but really that is just the stage that is used for a movie that explores many aspects of human nature. Time Lapse gives its characters a tool that can fulfill all their desires, and then shows the addiction, greed, manipulation, and general moral decay that follows.Bradley King and BP Cooper did a stellar job with the writing. They waste no time in setting up the plot, immediately put you on the edge of your seat, and keep you there until the credits roll. All the actors turned in excellent performances despite the challenge of their characters being designed to remind you of the parts of yourself that you try to deny. This is not a story of heroes doing heroic things; it is a story of your awkward twenty-something self trying to find the guts to do the right thing. The cinematography is particularly incredible. The movie is confined to a single modest apartment complex, and yet somehow it is chillingly beautiful. I never thought a man looking at a bunch of Polaroids pinned to a wall would be the recipe for a spectacular shot, but somehow it is. I haven't seen a movie with this kind of creepy and eerie beauty since Jean- Pierre Jeunet's early films.Time lapse is the directorial debut for Bradley King, and yet you would never know it by watching the movie. If he can pull something like this off on his first try at a feature film, I cannot wait to see what comes next.",positive
Southbound,"'SOUTHBOUND': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)An anthology horror flick, involving five interlocking stories; about a deadly stretch of desert highway, that brings travelers face to face with their worst nightmares. The film was directed by Radio Silence, Roxanne Benjamin, David Bruckner and Patrick Horvath; three of the four filmmakers also previously worked together on another horror anthology thriller, called 'V/H/S'. It was written by Benjamin, Bruckner, Horvath, Susan Burke, Dallas Hallam and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin (who also costars in the movie). The film was impressively made on a very low-budget, stars a cast of mostly unknowns, and surprisingly got rave reviews from most critics. I loved it as well.The movie's five chapters are titled 'The Way Out', 'Siren', 'The Accident', 'Jailbreak' and 'The Way In'. Each one deals with different people, traveling down the same stretch of highway. They must all confront different demons, and their worst fears (about themselves). One story involves two men trying to escape floating demons (that are relentlessly chasing them), another tells the tale of a female rock band (that breaks down on the deadly highway), another story deals with a man that hits a girl with his car, another one tells the tale of a brother trying to rescue his sister (he believes is being held captive there) and the final story deals with a family attacked by three masked strangers. All the segments appear to deal with purgatory, and Hell, and they all interlock. I'm a big horror movie fan; especially indie horror flicks, and especially horror anthology films. So I really like this movie. It's really well written, directed and acted. The film reminds me of similar type genre films, that I grew up on (as a kid); or similar TV shows (like 'THE TWILIGHT ZONE' and 'TALES FROM THE CRYPT'). This film rivals the 'V/H/S' franchise, in quality (which I'm a big fan of as well), so it didn't surprise me that most of the filmmakers worked on the first one (and some more than that). What I most love about this movie though, is that it reminds me of a real nightmare. Everything is so creepy, weird and bizarre; and nothing seems to make any sense (but it actually does). I have to give any film credit, that can capture that dream like quality so believably. I really like this movie!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFKDfA8QZiM",negative
Southbound,"As an Actor myself Anthology films are one of my favorites in the genre but many times you get several stories that dont hold up to the others, in Southbound however that is not the case. This is a film that could have easily come out back in the 70s 80s and even has that grindhouse look and feel and feel especially with the score. I highly recommend this one check it out !",positive
Wildling,Pretty much a pile of muck. You know basically immediately that the girl is the wildling. The sheriff and her brother don't. They buy her tampons and take her to parties. Luckily there is a guy in town who wears a pelt jacket and has a milky eye who really gets her. Laughable. Some OK cinematography.,negative
Wildling,"I adore werewolf movies, so I'm going to be more biased and forgiving than someone looking for the next award-winner. Entertain me for an hour or two, that's all I ask.The tone of this movie is creepy from the get-go and even though you can put it together as you go along, the top-notch acting pulls you in and keeps you there. I was never bored waiting for something to happen.Bel Powley was absolutely brilliant in the lead role from start to finish and the make-up was so well-done. They went with practical effects and it is so appreciated!Ginger Snaps has been my go-to for the quintessential female (coming-of-age) werewolf film for years, now. This will need a few more viewings before I swap this one for that one, but I feel like there's finally a contender and I LOVE that.",positive
Maggie,"I believe this film is miscategorized as a thriller or horror. To my surprise a zombie movie pulled off drama better than any other I've seen. This film had a human element to it, where I felt like I was living the experience with everyone. It is a story of the human experience of life, love, and loss. They do a profound job telling this story, taking their time with cinematic shots, dramatic and emotional music, and effective dialogue. A few parts fell flat but overall grab the popcorn, but don't expect an edge of your seat thriller. In the past Arnold has been casted in movies where he's more of a body than a person, here he actually has dialogue, which was heartfelt and well delivered.",negative
Maggie,"I've heard complaints from a number of people, expressing disdain for Maggie; people keep insisting that it was slow or boring. I don't know what any of them are even talking about. My only suspicion is that they are burdened with a poor attention span. Sure, it is slower than the typical Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick (and I can't deny that I have enjoyed quite a few of those)...and it isn't one of the generic shoot-em-up zombie movies (which I happen to enjoy quite a bit). What people seem to be forgetting is that it wasn't written to be either of those things, and if that was what they expected, the fault is their own...as the movie never makes an attempt to trick the viewer into thinking it might be that sort of movie. The minimalistic score is somber and about as perfect as it could be, the washed out cinematography lends itself well to the desolation of both the world of the movie and the depressing narrative itself, and the acting in all cases is superb...seriously, this is one of Schwarzenegger's most impressive performances, displaying greater depth and humanity than his typical roles allow. Think of this movie as being a beautifully executed amalgam of The Road and The Walking Dead...leaning a little more toward The Road. It is a touching, and intensely sad story of a man desperate to milk the last little bit of fatherhood out of the limited time he has with his dying daughter, and a girl who just wants to live a couple of weeks longer as if things were still OK. There are a couple of tense scenes arising from the nightmarish place the world has become that end up being fairly understated, but they are not the focus of the story, nor are the zombies that people are becoming...those are simply elements of the setting in which the story takes place. In that sense, this movie ends up sharing one of my favorite things about The Walking Dead, that it is ultimately a character study, a detailed focus on human beings and how they are forced to adapt to a situation that no one could ever truly prepare for. Unlike the Walking Dead, Maggie felt like it had a much more even flow to it, it wasn't as unevenly paced, in part because it had no pretense of being action-oriented at any point. It's sincerely quite depressing, but well worth the time spent watching it. I'm sure that plenty of people will disagree with my assessment of this movie, but I really found no fault in it.",positive
Cooties,"I can honestly say I hated 'Cooties'' within the first five minutes.When you make a horror/comedy, and the comedy falls flat on every level, you're in for a very long 90 minutes. I can imagine people walking out of this one around the 15 minute mark, because that's when my limit of stupidity had reach it's maximum capacity. There just isn't enough horror to make up for the rest of the film. The acting is some of the worst I've seen all year. Maybe the worst. Alison Pill and Jack McBrayer are worthy of a Razzie nomination, at the very least. They give hands down the worst performances you're going to see in any film this year. Elijah Wood is terribly miscast, as he's inserted into a role that would be best played by Adam Sandler. That's right, Elijah Wood, you get a pass on this one. Words cannot describe how bad the dialogue is, so I won't even try. You'll just have to experience it for yourself. My apologies.The best way to describe this awful film, is that it's something you'd expect from Adam Sandler - and I'm curious how and why he missed the boat here. Maybe he was busy with 'Pixels?' I am just baffled how a film this bad can get any type of positive feedback, as it is complete and utter trash. Do yourself a favor and check out 'Bloodsucking Bastards' instead. Random Ramblings of a Madman: Out of all my reviews, this is the only review where I'm curious to see how many down votes I receive. Because it tells me that somewhere out there is a person or persons who actually enjoyed 'Cooties.' And that will be funnier than anything I experienced in the film itself. Thank you.",negative
Cooties,"Clint (Elijah Wood) goes to his old school, Fort Chicken elementary school, Illinois (GO FIGHTING ROOSTERS!) as a substitute teacher. He meets Lucy (Alison Pill) an old friend who has trouble with normal conversations. Her boyfriend is the PE teacher Wade (Rainn Wilson) who owns a truck with duo rear wheels. The film introduces us to a number of quirky characters and kids that are not that adorable. Due to a viral breakout caused by processed chicken nuggets (I tossed mine out after seeing how nuggets are made from pink paste) the children turn into blood thirsty zombies who attack in hordes with some limited mental capacities.The film spoofs formula writing: dress up montage; guy who is way too smart; self-sacrifice individual; climbing through the vent duct; and a reference to a previous film...""Sneak around like a little Hobbit.""This is a funny zombie style cult film.Guide: F-bomb.

Yoga Hosers,"In the 90's, Kevin Smith became an icon with ""Clerks"", ""Malllrats"" ""Chasing Amy"" and ""Dogma"". Unfortunately along his next works, he has never reached the same success again.""Yoga Hosers"" is probably the bottom of his career, with an unfunny and annoying story. His daughter and Johnny Depp's daughter acting are terrible and they only had this chance because of the influence of their fathers with the producers. The name of Johnny Depp is embarrassing and used to lure the viewers. In the end, ""Yoga Haters"" is a means to spend 88 minutes of your life watching a comedy without laughing. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): Not available",negative
Yoga Hosers,I love Kevin Smith!!! I saw Yoga Hosers in the theatre and sometimes it's nice to see a movie that requires NO brain power! Johnny Depp did it for me! I love the Guy LaPointe character! I just laugh hearing him talk! I thought it was awesome!,positive
Rings,"Seven days! A simple phrase that struck terror in our hearts oh so many years ago. Certainly, you know I'm talking of The Ring, the horror movie about a death delivering video tape certain to scare you to death. Samara's tale has fallen on to the backburner for some time, but like the cursed video, the series has resurfaced to the modern world to once more have you cowering at your screens. Will Rings live up to the potential? Robbie K here, once more sharing his opinions on yet another film. Let's get started. LIKES:  Decent acting  Nice blend into the modern era  Strong story for a horrorSummary: Okay, this movie is certainly not going to win awards for best performance, but Rings' cast has some skill in their performances of college kids plagued by an evil spirit. Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz and Alex Roe are the leads of this tale, doing a great job of balancing romance and detective work, finally a power couple who wasn't annoying. And Johnny Galecki trades one nerd role for another, though this time his scientific qualities had a little darker twist to the mix. Overall, the cast gets a pat on the back for establishing some good characters to hook on to. Yet the major things this reviewer liked involved the story components of the movie. Rings has jumped into the modern area, dropping the outdated VHS tapes for modern day MP4 files. It will help bridge the generation gaps, and add a new element that the other installments were missing. And the story was much stronger than I anticipated. Rings has more mystery to it, trying to find the answers to the elusive mystery of Samara's origins. Where it fits in the grand scheme of things is a little up in the air, but at least there is some character development and drama to spice things up. And as for the ending, it too is a little ambiguous, providing some delightfully dark closure, but still leaving it open for future installments. Not the strongest finish, but also not bad. DISLIKES:  Scare Factor at A Low  Some plot elements lackluster  Not the same RingSummary: Rings story may be on target, but the scare factor still didn't reach the same levels that the first movie was able to achieve. This installment resorted to jump out scare moments, mainly trying to make you jump with sudden loud noises and hallucinations appearing from out of nowhere. Many of these moments weren't well timed, and to be honest many of the objects just weren't scary. Think of the first film and how creepy everything was, the unknown always teasing you until something sprung out of nowhere. All that was very diluted in this installment. Even though they finally show you how she kills her victims, the team didn't quite make it as horrifying as I thought it would be (think ghost rider's soul stare without the flashy fire). Rings was lacking this element, and had more of a mystery theme to it than an actual horror. In addition, there were also some plot elements that didn't shine as much as they wanted. For this reviewer, there is still some questions they still haven't fully answered that you have to draw yourself. The bottom line of the dislikes is that Rings didn't quite hit the same level the first movie had all those years ago. The VERDICT:In conclusion, Ring is not so much a horror movie in this round, but a mystery film about uncovering the origins of Samara. While the cast is decent, the story is mostly thought out, and we have some answer, it still didn't feel like the Ring series we've come to know. If you are looking for a movie to scare the pants off of you, sorry this isn't the film to do it. And you can probably guess, but yours truly doesn't recommend this one for the theater and implores you to wait until it hits home rental stands. Only people who might enjoy this one in theater are those who care about the story element of the movie, but I still think you can wait for home (I mean we have been waiting twelve years for this one right?). My scores are:Drama/Horror: 6.5 Movie Overall: 5.0",negative
Rings,"Sometimes regardless of view, a film is just a bad film, regardless of actors, script and production. This is one such film, it is a bad film, it scores points for the terrific opening on the plane, it's no wonder that scene was shown as the main trailer, bold, dynamic, truly thrilling. Sadly, after that excellent opening, the film became a virtual mess.The terror once caused by Samara, now had an almost comedic value, at one stage it felt as though an attempt was made to give her an almost cuddly likeability, it was pitched incredibly badly.It lacked any real scares, the original was disturbing to the point that many didn't want to watch the actual video, as a horror it was terrific, this was a horror non entity.The acting was decent, though they were up against a terrible script.After a great opening, this dies a slow death. 3/10",positive
The Forest,"THE FOREST (2016) * Natalie Dormer, Taylor Kinney, Eoin Macken, Yukiyoshi Ozawa, Rina Takasaki, Stephanie Vogt. Yawnfest horror film about an obnoxious young woman (Dormer; zero charisma) who is haunted and determined to find her twin sister in the thicket of a supernatural Japanese thicket where those with suicidal tendencies seek out as some sort of sacred burial ground. There is nothing to a plot let alone any sympathy or empathy for such a noxious heroine to endure you want her to succumb to a violent end. No suspense, scares, or sense. Skip it by all means. Sadly continues the unofficial January release that blows! (Dir: Jason Zada)",negative
The Forest,This movie was created by a first time director and very good but not that known actors. With that being said I loved it and didn't judge it before hand. The critics judge the movie unfairly. If it was a Hollywood powerful director and known actors that are influential then The Forest would of got a fair shake. Which watching The Forest I couldn't stop watching it for a second and that's rare with horror movies. Instead because this movie was done by unknowns it should of been praised. But like life Hollywood is unfair and critics make most of there money from powerful Hollywood people not giving good reviews where they are warranted like in The Forest.,positive
Demonic,"Where to begin? Well, first of all ""Demonic"" brings absolutely nothing to the horror genre which hasn't already been seen countless times in other similar, and most likely more interesting and entertaining movies. With that in mind, you might think that director Will Canon would be playing it safe and bet on the horses that might actually bring the movie safely to the goal line. But no, that was not the case.""Demonic"" is every bit as boring and uneventful as it was predictable, generic and cliché-filled. There are no twists or turns along the storyline and you sit in the chair for a very mundane and predictable thrill ride, albeit without the thrills.I actually fell asleep during the course of ""Demonic"", which is a testament to how boring the movie is. Especially since I watch a lot of questionable movies (B-movies) and such, so I am seasoned and hardened to movies, and it really takes a lot before I get up and turn off a movie, or as in the case of ""Demonic"" fall asleep while watching a movie.The acting in the movie was adequate, although I can't really bring any particular talent out in the light as being memorable or particularly outstanding.However, the movie was just struck down by the director's hand, the script and a total lack of anything even remotely scary. The storyline was so scripted that the audience is offered nothing enticing or thrilling in any sense. It was all in all just a long, very long, run on a fully automated track.If you enjoy horror movies, then there are far better choices available on the market. And I would suggest that you give ""Demonic"" a wide berth. It just simply isn't worth the time or effort.",negative
Demonic,This movie is quite good and I really don't know why it has such a bad grade. All the stories in horror movies are very similar but this one is actually little bit different. We see this story from two angles and until the end we don't know what is going to happend. I really liked it and I recomend this movie to everyone who enjoy a good horror. =),positive
Ouija,"If I Could give this a lower score than 1, I would. The concept is (particularly in recent years) terribly overdone. There was nothing substantial in this film to make it different or stand out from the rest of the horde of supernatural movies. It seems to be your run of the mill horror film trying to ride on the money train that ""paranormal activity"" and ""the conjuring"" created as the new horror standard. Maybe it's just that I expected a lot more from it; especially as it had such great advertising and publicity, however this was a snooze-fest start to end. Even the acting was flat and I cared nothing for any of the characters involved. I definitely have seen worse in terms of budget, concept, etc. but at least they had a certain quirk or charm to them that made them different. In short, it felt like I had already seen this film 1,000 times before. Unfortunately this one happened to be the most boring film I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through.",negative
Ouija,I honestly don't know why this movie only has a 4.4 rating. Having looked at that before walking into the theater made me a little apprehensive about buying a ticket but boy was I in for a surprise. This movie keeps you scared the whole way through. Contains lots of creative jump scares and good plot twists. Lin Shaye is excellent as always especially in horror movies. The pace does not seem too slow or too fast and there aren't any long breaks between something scary happening. Having said that this movie does require a bit of imagination as most horror movies do but if you push reality aside for 90 minutes you will not be disappointed. In my opinion this is a well-written horror movie that is highly underrated. I would definitely watch it again.,positive
Under the Shadow,"An international co-production between Qatar, Jordan, and the United Kingdom, Under the Shadow is the first Iranian ""horror"" movie I can remember. The film is the first feature from Iranian-born Babak Anvari. The strength of the film is its setting: the action takes place in Tehran in 1988, the last year of the Iran-Iraq war.The most interesting aspects of the film have nothing to do with its horror components but rather the ""horrifying"" nature of the post-Revolutionary regime that oppresses the very people whom it professes to righteously serve. Director Anvari's portrait of his protagonist, Shideh (Narges Rashidi), the Mom who's left home alone with young daughter Dorsa (Avin Manshadi) after her physician-husband is called to the front, is an explicit example of Iranian regime's oppressive nature. Shideh learns right away that she's been barred from resuming her medical school studies due to earlier participation in some rather benign left-wing protests against the government.While most of the action of the story that takes place in Shideh's apartment is perfunctory, whenever we're reminded of what's going on in the ""real world"" outside, that's a subject that proves abidingly of great interest. This includes Dorsa's cousin, a young boy, who is mute after experiencing the devastating deaths of his parents as a result of Iraqi missiles. Soon afterward, one of those missiles strikes Shideh's building, causing a crack in her ceiling. The missile remains unexploded and must be defused and carted away before it can wreak havoc on the remaining occupants in the building.In perhaps the most telling scene outside the apartment, Shideh flees after experiencing disturbing visions including a half-naked elderly man and floating chador, and is arrested by the morality police for failing to keep her head covered with a traditional scarf. She's let go with a warning and I only wish there were more scenes like this, highlighting the nature and quality of a regime that treats its citizens in such an unjust manner.Alas, the bulk of Under the Shadow attempts instead to imitate the typical Hollywood horror film. Instead of gremlins, we're asked to believe in the Iranian version of a tall-tale—the Djinn (evil spirits mentioned in the Koran that typically first take possession of a physical object of its victim before gaining possession of the entire soul). Shideh, with her medical/scientific background, first rejects the notion of evil spirits but later becomes a ""true believer,"" after the Djinn grab Dorsa's doll Kimia and try to permanently snatch the little girl from her beleaguered parent.No need to recapitulate any more of the vagaries of the plot, but suffice it to say that both Shideh and Dorsa take turns in rescuing one another from the big bad evil spirits. While they finally do escape by driving the car through the garage door, we ominously learn that the Djinn are still in possession of Kimia's severed head. More bad things appear to be on the horizon for Shideh and Dorsa!You might have guessed that I am not a big fan of horror films and this one is no exception. If only the film's scenarists had concentrated more on the verisimilitude of an oppressive theocracy which is Iran even today--in contrast to replicating commonplace Hollywood devices—Under the Shadow might have proved far more educational and compelling.",negative
Under the Shadow,"In the 80's, during the war between the Islamic post-revolutionary Iran and Iraq, the former leftist medical student Shideh (Narges Rashidi) tries to return to the university but is barred by the dean. The upset Shideh returns home and when her husband Dr. Iraj (Bobby Naderi) is assigned to work in a war zone, she refuses to move to his parent's house with their daughter Dorsa (Avin Manshadi). Shideh prefers to stay in her apartment with Dorsa, who loves her doll Kimia and has constant fever. Dorsa is afraid of demoniac Djinns and when Shideh asks who told her about the legend, she tells that her friend that lives downstairs. Shideh visits her neighbor and asks his mother to tell her son to not tell horror stories to Dorsa and she learns that the boy is mute. Then Kimia and Shideh's Jane Fonda workout tape disappear. When a missile strikes their building, the neighbors decide to leave Tehran, but Shideh stays in the apartment with Dorsa, who is increasingly disturbed. Soon Shideh reads about Djinns and finds that there is an evil entity in the apartment. Further she must find Kimia; otherwise Dorsa will be in danger since the Djinn will be attached to her.""Under the Shadow"" is an atmospheric and spooky ghost story in an unusual environment – Tehran in the 80's. The difference to the Western cultures is another attraction of this film, such as punishment of the woman for not wearing headscarf or for having a videocassette at home. The story has elements from ""The Babadook"" but is better than the 2014 film. The conclusion is open for a sequel, like most of the films of this genre. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): Not Available.",positive
Cult of Chucky,"Cult of Chucky (2017) ** (out of 4) After the events from the previous film, Nica (Fiona Dourif) is now in a low-risk mental hospital where her doctor decides to really cure her by bringing in a Good Guy doll. This here sets off some strange events and elsewhere Andy (Alex Vincent) is trying to find a plan to defeat Chucky once and for all.There's no question that the first CHILD'S PLAY was a very good and entertaining horror film. The sequels that followed were all of mixed quality but the last film, CURSE OF CHUCKY, was in my opinion the best of the bunch and it gave me real hope for this one. Sadly, CULT OF CHUCKY comes as a major disappointment as there's really not too much entertainment to be had. They might have added more Chucky dolls but they didn't add much else.The film started off fairly good as we catch up with Alex and see how Chucky is still having an impact on his life. All is well when we're re-introduced to the Nica character and we see her trying to move on from her ""crimes"" of the previous film. Once we hit the mental hospital we get a ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST joke and it's pretty much downhill from here. It seems the screenplay was trying to tie too many things together and in the end none of it worked too well. You got the continuation of CURSE OF CHUCKY as well as the connection to the Alex character and the first three films. You've also got Jennifer Tilly showing back up so you've got the connection to BRIDE OF CHUCKY and SEED OF CHUCKY.You've got all of these connections to previous films but it just makes for a mess of a film. The movie really doesn't know if it wants to be a straight horror film or if it wants to take Chucky back to his comedian days. There are a lot of really lame jokes here that aren't funny and there are also a lot of pop culture references and these here are really lame. The film does go for some extreme gore during its death scenes and if you're watching the unrated version then you'll see some pretty graphic stuff.I thought Dourif, Vincent, Tilly and Adan Hurtig are all good in their roles. Brad Dourif returns to the role of Chucky's voice and he too is quite good. I'm not going to spoil the ending but it makes me interesting to see where future installments go but lets hope the screenplays are a tad bit more clear and not trying to do so much.",negative

Wish Upon,"If Tina Fey had have been brutally dropped on her head as a baby and decided to write a horror film, having never seen one before in her drooling, cabbaged life; it might look something like this. Who on earth is this movie aimed at? Is it supposed to be a spooky morality tale, or a dark high school comedy for girls? Oddly enough, in trying to be both, it succeeds in neither. The writer's conceit reeks through this whole effort, they obviously thought they were being exceptionally clever with little references to the multiverse and having Jerry O'Connell (from Sliders) making a cameo; but the whole thing just screams 'amateurish overindulgence'. The tone of the movie is all over the place and the protagonist is an absolute psycho, even before she starts murdering people with a Chinese box; just so she can be popular. She's also perhaps the densest person known to man, singularly failing to realise what's happening as everything she wishes for comes true; and bizarrely, not taking advantage of the situation when it does. We're supposed to believe that a box has sat in a bin on the street untouched for ten, or more years, in a town where her father scavenges the same bins seemingly several times a week? Instead of prattling on about physics she doesn't understand, perhaps the writer could have spent some of that excessive brainpower on filling this egregious plot hole, and all the others besides. The soundtrack is without a doubt the most inappropriate, awful racket that has ever graced a so-called horror movie; it's like Sofia Coppola was ingested by Lena Dunham in some bizarre satanic union, and this music was the accidental result. I am very skeptical that this film has gotten so many nine and ten star reviews on this site - something is very rotten in the state of Denmark. I expect with Halloween coming up, we'll see a truer picture of how this movie is received as more and more people have the misfortune to actually watch it.Plus points: Barb.",negative
Wish Upon,"There are so many moments, so many lines, scenes, deaths and editing issues in this film that it is unbelievably funny. I have watched scenes in this film multiple times because I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The characters don't communicate like humans, the person who wrote this clearly has no understanding of how young people actually are and how they behave. Every teenager in this film has a massive font on their phone like they're 80 years old. There's a scene in a cafeteria where they trade hilariously inept insults. It is genuinely amazing.I am writing a seperate paragraph just for the ending because oh my, it is the best ending I've ever seen. I've seen The Room, Birdemic, Troll 2, Vampires Kiss, you name it, I've seen it. But this is easily the funniest ending I have ever ever seen. It's so bad, so nonsensical, so inept and so unaware that it is so bad that I ended up watching it a further 10 times at least.

She is capable of mysterious and ethereal powers, and more than she knows because her manipulative and fundamentalist parents keep such things under wraps in home-school.

The next day when Anja can't be found, Thelma has a sickening feeling she had something to do with it. She searches for answers to the secrets and powers that beguile and haunt her.This thrilling, deep, complex and sensual film explores a whole realm of different theories and possibilities. I was surprised and delighted by its twists and turns. It crosses borders between reality and fantasy, and light and darkness, and explores the good and bad in human nature. The actors are amazing, especially Eili Harboe as Thelma and Kaya Wilkins as Anja. It is fantastic to discover that the roots of psychogenic disorders go back as far as Joan of Arc.

Cold Skin,"Short opening preview:COLD SKIN opens with scenes of a young man, whose name is Friend, on the deck of a tramp steamer bound, as we are to learn, for a remote island where he is to perform duties as a weather observer for a term of 12 months. The aged and worn Capt. of the clanking old vessel, Capt. Axel, chats with Friend on the deck with surprising kindness. Colorfully, Friend observes that the captain treats him with the felicitousness of the executioner for the condemned.Almost immediately, we arrive at Friend's island destination, an intensely desolate place with almost no vegetation, all volcanic rocks with a little sand. Incongruously perched like a wart on an otherwise featureless face, the small cabin Friend is to call home for the next 12 months squats not far from the shore, surrounded by the few constructs necessary to support Friend's weather observation activities. A few sailors carry Friend's meager belongings into the cabin which appears in a bit more disarray than one would expect. Friend is supposed to replace the existing weather observer, but the present occupant of the cabin is nowhere to be found.Capt. Axel sends the sailors away and then he and Friend go to a lighthouse some distance away in hopes of questioning the lighthouse operator as to the whereabouts of the existing weather observer. Upon arriving at the lighthouse, we see a most unusual structure. The lighthouse and its immediate surrounds are bristling with sharp sticks and festooned with other such unwelcoming accoutrement at every possible point of attachment. No one answers the door even after much yelling and pounding at the door.Breaking in, Friend and Capt. Axel discover the lighthouse operator upstairs, passed out naked, apparently from too much drink. Friend and Capt. Axel rouse the lighthouse operator who gives every indication of being exceptionally hostile and unstable. As for the missing weather observer, the only explanation they get from the lighthouse operator, who we learn is named Gruner, are some vague mumblings about his having died from disease.Friend and Capt. Axel return to Friend's own cabin where Capt. Axel attempts to dissuade Friend from remaining in this awful place just one final time. Friend refuses and the pair bid each other a pleasant farewell.That very night, Friend hears someone or something moving about immediately outside his cabin. He tentatively calls out to who he assumes is Gruner, but there is no answer. Startlingly, a dark, gray-green webbed hand reaches probingly beneath the cabin door. Understandably horrified, Friend immediately and enthusiastically stabs it with a knife. And so Friend's nightmare begins.Review:From the very first scene, COLD SKIN immediately impresses with its production values. The music is excellent and atmospheric, the cinematography is engaging and colorful with an almost Jules Vern-esque adventure feel, and the actors are colorful and well played. The special-effects/CGI are first-rate. The island setting is superbly appropriate for the subject matter and is so desolate it feels frightening just sitting there, doing nothing. So, for most aspects of its production, COLD SKIN gets a solid 10/10.Unfortunately, and in my opinion most disappointingly, the entire thing falls flat due to a storyline that is utter unmitigated, illogical rubbish. The movie wishes to pile-drive us in the face with a morality tale about xenophobia, apparently, and is willing to corrupt its own storyline to the point of utter nonsense in order to do it. The net effect is a storyline that, if you think about it for more than 5 seconds, makes absolutely no sense.Why are the fish-people willing to mindlessly throw themselves in mass attacks against the lighthouse night after night only to be killed by the score? What are they after? The land is not their domain of interest and even if it was there are no resources there as it is utterly barren. If it's the fish-girl that's keeping company with Gruner that's attracting them, what's so special about her? If the fish-girl is causing the attacks, does she not care that her brethren are being killed by the busload every night? Why do the fish-people only attack at night when it's abundantly clear they're perfectly happy to be out in the daylight? Why does Gruner say they fear the light when they obviously don't? Why does the fish-girl want to keep company with humans who treat her like garbage? She's not being held prisoner in any way and has access to the water whenever she wants. Why does Gruner, who has been working diligently to massacre them by the hundreds for the entire picture, suddenly walk out the door at the end and allow himself to be torn to pieces? I only stop here arbitrarily; this list could go on indefinitely.Movies can be highly stylized to the point of apparent insanity (BRAZIL, THE 9TH CONFIGURATION, etc.) and still have perfectly functional stories with which to tell their morality tales without fundamentally trashing the basic mechanisms and properties of decent storytelling. In a movie, even apparent insanity has to be carefully crafted and constructed, controlled and sculpted. It can't be shoveled out and thrown at the viewer like a monkey throwing poo at passersby at a zoo.And, sadly, in its zeal to hit us over the head with its moral, that's pretty much what COLD SKIN is like.Update 2/21/2018: Some have suggested to me that a reading of the original book from which COLD SKIN is derived might clarify my many irritations with respect to the story. This is a wholly unsuitable suggestion for numerous reasons, though I will only name a few. Firstly, barring exigent circumstances, a movie should stand on its own and should not rely on information ""not in evidence"". There are certain situations, such as the Star Wars franchise, where there are so many stories and sub-stories that make up the overall arc that are revealed in so many different kinds of media (animation, books, audio recordings, etc.) that one is obviously expected to explore these other elements to obtain the full sense of the franchise. COLD SKIN is not one of those circumstances. It is simply a poor story poorly expressed. If one MUST read the book to understand the movie, why see the movie?I suffered enough with the movie and so, truthfully, I have not read the book. A friend of mine, however, has. I put some of the collection of questions I have regarding the overall story to my friend and she was not any more able to answer them than I was with the movie with the single exception of the question as to why the Sitauca (the formal name of the fish/frog/whatever people) incessantly attack the weatherman and the lighthouse keeper; it was for the warm meat. This of course makes obvious sense; innumerable hundreds of at least semi-sentient beings would obviously be willing to sacrifice themselves for only 2 food kills at best. Uh-Huh.In short, the book form of COLD SKIN adds more, and I am told repetitive, detail but little if any more clarity. The story is a self-indulgence of an author that is primarily an anthropologist possessed of Deep Meanings he wishes to express. There are some 7.6 billion people in the world and it is inevitable that there will be a few who share the author's peculiar brand of moral navel contemplation; others will be less impressed. Reading the book illuminates issues only for the predisposed.",negative
Cold Skin,"This film will not be for everyone (hence the disappointing low rating). For starters, it's almost an exact adaptation from the Spanish (Barcelona, Spain) award wining debut novel (translated to 37 languages) by Albert Sánchez Piñol, and directed almost perfectly by Frenchman Xavier Gens. It is not your typical big-screen huge budget Hollywood action blockbuster with A-list actors, and thus should not be compared (as other reviews have) to The Shape of Water. Instead, it's an artistic piece shot extremely well that was written by a Spaniard and presented by a Frenchman - definitely no Hollywood here.The directing, cinematography, landscape, vfx/sfx and score where outstanding - near perfect. The actors (never heard of either) performed exceptionally well and were very convincing. Yes, there were some avoidable obvious plot issues, which was disappointing considering how great the rest of the production was. However I'm thinking that it was an editing issue and cutting scenes to get the length down to 108 mins, of which considering the slow pace, I'd be complaining on the length, yet it didn't feel that long. It could also be a screenplay adaptation issue from the two novice writers - they did squeeze in as much as they could from the novel, but maybe should have cut certain scenes shorter to fill in the blanks.I've read some reviewers had questions about certain things that happened. Some of those issue are answered if you stop and think why this happened and/or dig a little deeper into the meaning. Others, you will need to read the book. I did, and have nothing to question, but do understand how others who didn't read the book would have questions.A very impressive film, unlike any other I have seen, and needs to be appreciated for what it is, and how is was shown. Would I recommend it or see it again? Absolutely. Had better screenwriters adapted the novel, this would have been a perfect 10/10. But still is a well deserved 8.5 rounded up to a 9/10 from me.",positive
Bad Samaritan,"I don't know where to start. Except to say how dumb do writers think their viewers are? So this ""bad guy"" can make one phpne call and get people fired?

Devil's Pass,"As a movie, especially one from the category of wobbly shaky camera films, it is not that bad. It's a cliché, from the start to the end, but you can't really blame it for not being the first to do what it does. I also know nothing about the Dyatlov incident and I suspect the movie has little to do with it, other than the name.Weirdly enough, the name was what drew me to the film and I have no idea why someone would rename it blandly ""Devil's Pass"", which has absolutely nothing to do with the plot and is probably one of many movies to be thus named.Anyway, the film: young maniacally happy Americans go to investigate, equipped with apparently a new type of recording device that needs no recharging, since it keeps going for days. They get there, die from various reasons which border from implausible to funny, then end in a kind of Twilight Zone way, with lots of bad CGI.The idea wasn't really bad, either, just the execution. All in all, it was a classic hand held camera horror, without being scary, though. I liked the sci-fi twist to it all, but not the execution (or the characters, or the actors). I liked that they really went to a place where people actually spoke Russian, not mangled the language horribly in the hope that no viewer actually speaks it.I can't rate it average. It had too many plot holes, bad cgi, etc. But it was close.",negative
Devil's Pass,"I did not expect much, but I was good surprised by the last part of the movie. Starting from detailed documentary of suspicious mystery the story become more and more thrilling with every development. Good balance between storyline and rhythm of the movie. Medium part should be the end for most Hollywood movies without any wonder, but that was not the finish line. Unfortunately low budget shooting at the end but excellent shift of time and lovely transformation of principal characters that turns fantasy to science fiction. Underestimated IMDb rates probably because people don't recognize Russia and military style, but my own eyes of witness recognize it as a true footage. Recommended for people with open mind and writers as a good example of drama development.",positive
Tale of Tales,"I am going to say it up front, this film is a mess. I am baffled at how it completely ignores every possible way of being a coherent or at least meaningful movie. It doesn't fail to give some kind of form of entertainment and very rarely raises interest, but ultimately it is just pseudo-intellectualism at it's very worst.Even though I am the first to say that there is no way to ultimately classify movies, I will say that I kind of like to think that there are conventional and unconventional films and in no way one category is superior to the other. When using an unconventional medium, which is certainly what ""The Tale of Tales"" is doing, you are definitely ignoring some of the basic rules of filmaking and trying to achieve something original or unusual, yet what comes with ignoring those rules is the fact that you have to hook your audience, you have to keep them interested or what is going on on screen will just be a disjointed group of images that will bore more than entertain. Unfortunately, Garrone's movie doesn't have either elements, it doesn't have an arrival point, it doesn't push forward originality in anyway and it most certainly doesn't have a hook for the audience. It is just a disaster. I have never said this in my entire life, but I honestly would not know how to describe the plot of this film to anybody. Why that might be? I know, because there isn't a plot, there isn't a story, there isn't a meaning, there isn't coherence and there aren't any characters; no those people walking around on screen are just people walking around on screen in wonderful dresses, they certainly aren't characters because I would not know how to f**ing identify them without revealing their names or their physical appearance. The lenght to which these film is unremarkable and just a bore-fest are really surprising.I will give props to Garrone because I don't think there are many ways to turn this crap material into a better film. The photography is most certainly beautiful. There is some weird and dark yet pleasant imagery scattered around the film that actually makes for a limited interesting watch and I will say that there is a finale of one of the three stories that I actually quite enjoyed. Finally Desplat delivers a another great score as usual.And that's it. This isn't an atrocious or annoying film, I was never angry at it surprisingly for its aimlessness, but it is just mediocre and stupidly pretentious. I certainly don't know on what kind of drugs they were on at Cannes for giving this the reception it got, further demonstrating what type of pretentious audience there is.",negative
Tale of Tales,"It's a fantastic audio-visual journey that takes you into a world of medieval fantasies full of all the classical elements but with fresh stories and views. If you enjoy the work of Paolo Sorrentino (2013 Oscar for ""La grande bellezza"") you will love this film for it's masterful craft of building a world within. Only Salma Hayek delivers a disappointing performance: Stiff and uninspired. Pictures, music as well as sound design and costumes (not to mention the practical effects) are all stunning! Italy (with the help of France and the UK) delivers once again a masterpiece on the very tight budget of only 12 million uros while the rest of European cinema is sleeping.",positive
I Spit on Your Grave: Vengeance is Mine,"Another dumb blunder by people who simply do not understand genre film and have no business making them.Apparently the geniuses who produced this said to themselves, hey, for all you fans of the original movies and the remakes before this, we thought you'd like a basic revenge drama, rather than a exploitation genre film. Ahhh, no. No, we won't like that.This movie will appeal to no one. Nobody. I don't even get what it is. It takes a classic exploitation genre and turns it into a boring lifetime channel revenge drama.A complete waste of time in every way.",negative
I Spit on Your Grave: Vengeance is Mine,"I must admit that I was a tad excited about a third movie in this brutal series coming out and I was thrilled when I finally got the chance to sit down and watch it. But my expectations were equally brutally cut down in size.This third movie was nowhere near the same level of intensity, brutality and entertainment as the previous two movies. Mind you, that it is still a good enough movie to watch, just don't get your expectations up for it to follow in the same bloody footsteps as the previous two movies.It was nice, though, to have the Angela character (played by Sarah Butler) to return to the movie, although the character did seem sort of a spoof and a parody on itself, given the events in the first movie, and how she had turned out in the third movie.The story in ""I Spit on Your Grave 3: Vengeance Is Mine"" was fairly straight forward, albeit lacking a deeper content and a meaning that would be satisfying and fulfilling for the audience.The acting in the movie was good, as it has been since the first movie. And the special effects were great, also as they had been in the previous movies. And while this third movie didn't have as much violence as the previous two movies, then the effects and presentation of the situations were right up to level with the previous movies. There are some graphic scenes which will make you squirm - especially if you are a guy.However, the movie just lacked that special ingredient to make it a worthy third installment to the series. But isn't that the perpetual curse of sequels? They tend to drop in worth and entertainment the further the series continues on.I am rating ""I Spit on Your Grave 3: Vengeance Is Mine"" a mediocre five out of ten stars, because it just wasn't living up to my expectations on any level.",positive
Winchester,"WINCHESTER (2018) * Helen Mirren, Jason Clarke, Sarah Snook, Finn Scicluna-O'Prey, Emm Wiseman, Tyler Coppin, Angus Sampson, Eamon Farren.

While the co-directing sibling team, The Spierig Brothers have a keen visual eye it is all for naught in a boring as hell screenplay they have co-written with Tom Vaughan it is nearly unbearable to watch.",negative
Winchester,"I saw this house in the 80s, was impressed by tour guides; all the women were dressed in some kind of period garb from the 1860s, full hoop skirts; by all accounts this woman was widely regarded as a very sweet, kindly lady who provided employment for hundreds of workers; she should not have felt guilty about the thousands of people who fell victim to the gun that won the west,& the tortured souls who came back to seek vengeance on her; it was her husband who should have felt guilt & atonement for the men & women who met a violent end from this weapon of mass destruction; but if she was a woman that these souls branded a villainous demon, I would have said to her:'...sarah, there have been many figures in past, both famous & obscure that tried to turn over a new leaf, renounced their past history, & disavowed their criminal misdeeds & tried to contribute to society( which she did by building this bewildering mansion); for what reason is a mystery, some kind of transformation; a death in family, wartime experiences, a diagnosis of an interminable disease, or even a spiritual, religious transformation, it happens ,not often but occasionally in history...'>>",positive
Poltergeist,"I was really hoping that someone could pull this off but apprantly not even the great Sam Rami could muster up enough talent to save this God-awful remake.Sometimes remakes end up better than the original because of all the new tech, but nothing could pull this steaming pile of waste out of the toilet. I wonder if they dosed the entire crew with sleeping pills the acting was so dead. Esp the father behaved in ways I have never seen a real father behave, where in the hell do they their actors?
I have seen more talent at high school plays, and who wrote this crap unbelievable lines coming from unbelievable actors. I am sure my cat could deliver lines that would be more believable. The Original Poltergeist is a shining gem, this remake was a Steaming pile of excrement and that is putting it nicely. waste you time if you want, I guess that will pass time while we are all quarantine.or better yet watch the Original and have a good scare.",negative
Poltergeist,"First of all i'm a huge fan of horror films, so when i heard about a remake to the Poltergeist i was so excited and couldn't wait to see the trailer which actually surprised me. And I've went to the movies expecting to watch the old movie but with a few changes.The thing is , they changed A LOT! So if you have the same expectation well it's not what you think it is. The pace of the movie was really fast in a good way but the only problem was the build up and that it lacked the feelings between the family.The Scare factor: It basically relies on jump scares but i have to admit they were perfectly done and well timed . There were some clowns in a box which were sort of creepy. and also some edge-of- your seat moments. It's similar to ""Insidious"" and James Wan effects. So yes when it says from the producer of ""Evil Dead"" you know what to expect, But it won't prevent you from sleeping.The acting was fine, CGI was okay and there were wonderful visuals. The 3D was mainly used for the jump out of your seat moments in a gimmicky way (Throwing stuff at the audience).In the end, I had fun watching Poltergeist and it delivers a few thrills,Sam Raimi did a great job producing this film,for Gil Kenan (Director of Monster House) i think it's a huge step forward. But don't go in with very high expectations or you will be disappointed. Although you should watch it if you're a true horror fan and you're looking for some good scares.",positive
Mayhem,"For a movie about Mayhem in an office building due to a rage virus, there sure is a lot of talking and it sure takes a long time to get to the action. Aussie Goddess Samara Weaving is great as always but the rest of the movie is a bit of a chore.

Such a shame after Knights of Badassdom from the same director was so much fun",negative
Mayhem,"I just saw this today, and it was awesome. Hopefully, there will be a part 2 somehow. 10 out of 10 would see again. I also like how this is different to all the movies that are on today.

The Bye Bye Man,"Let's just all hope, the girl who played the girlfriend never gets a movie role ever again. The whole film felt like a joke and the acting was awful but that girl..i was laughing out loud and calling out for Jesus anytime she was on screen. Probably the worst 'acting' I have ever seen. About the story. There's really no story. There's this man who shows up when you say his name and makes you see and do things. For what reason tho? No clue. Where did he come from? No clue. Why? No clue. What's with his dog? No clue.",negative
The Bye Bye Man,"So, i've been waiting for a film adaptation of the Peepeepoopoo man for a very long time, and thankfully it was worth the wait. Ive seen the Peepeepoopoo man probably around 26 times, and i just cant get enough of the Peepeepoopoo man. Don't say it don't think it is the main way to keep the Peepeepoopoo man away, and if you do say or think the Peepeepoopoo man, you will be in for a rough ride, like the black lady who was all like ""Peepeepoopoo man"" in the library, she was tricked by the Peepeepoopoo man to kill her family, and then she gets run over by the main protagonist because she runs out onto the road.

Shin Godzilla,"The movie was a great satire on the Japanese Government during the time of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. The reactions by the Prime Minister, defense minister, etc etc during Godzilla's initial appearance perfectly recreate the indecision that lead to more people being killed in that country than necessary during the real life disaster. In short, this movie uses Godzilla to satirize the Japanese government. A new, more decisive body of government forms in the aftermath and one end of it wants to evacuate Tokyo to Nuke him and the other wants to make a more experimental approach by analyzing Godzilla's body chemistry (the science is actually pretty good and leads to a surprisingly tense climax that involves construction cranes pumping hoses down Godzillas throat). The scenes with the humans are also shot in a very dynamic and fast paced way. Characterization suffers (Japanese films do this thing where they just add an odd quirk to a characters personality and call it a day) but its all for the purpose on finding out how to take care of the giant monster rampaging through the city while minimizing human casualties. Believably too, like how the government would actually react would it have happened.As for the big guy himself, Toho definitely plays around with him a lot. He's still a big green iconic monster, but they change his design more than I've ever seen before. When he first appears in the movie, he's more like a tadpole and over the film evolves into the monster we know. But even then he does things like opens his lower jaw when breathing fire like the predator, shooting beams from his dorsal fin and tail, and there's even a VERY chilling shot at the end involving Godzillas tail with some imagery with broader implications on what Godzilla is able to do. But for all these new things that happen, there's a bunch of stylistic choices that keep it rooted in its history. There's music being used from the original 50's score than ever before (they use more than just that classic brass theme), Godzilla still has his trademark roar, and when he breathes fire in a way we've never seen before (it starts as gas, lights up into a jetstream of flame, and then concentrates into a beam) there's a classic sound effect played that we haven't heard in ages. In short, there's a bunch of new and classic stylistic choices in equal measure. Plus the scene where he destroys Tokyo is, in a weird way, gorgeous to look at.In short, this is the smartest giant monster movie I've ever seen. It's not for everybody but it's certainly for people who understand what that means.",negative
Shin Godzilla,"The film takes a somber, serious tone as to what would happen if Japan were attacked -- in this case, by a seemingly unstoppable foe. At present in Japan, there is an ongoing debate as to whether or not Japan should amend it's constitution to allow for an offensive military and this Godzilla film plays to exactly how powerless Japan would be in making it's own decisions during an attack of any kind. The reality is that the Japanese Prime Minister would have to ask for permission from the United States President before making an offensive move against a foreign threat and this film plays to that hard reality. This new Godzilla starts out as an homage to its former man in a monster suit so that when you first see Godzilla, you'll disbelieve what you're seeing, but this Godzilla evolves into something majestic and utterly awe inspiring in its power. What's more, this film makes it clear people die. In the Japanese release there's a lot of word play about how the government officials up high (on the fifth floor) make decisions that get passed down to people on lower floors that eventually hurt the people. I'm not sure how much will be translated, but the film is deliberately showing the disconnect between the political and day to day realities. Overall, the performances are good. There is one character who they, for whatever reason, decided to make speak English in odd an inappropriate times. This isn't a film for US audiences. The aesthetics will turn off a lot of non-Japanese young people accustomed to CG reality. But if you're open to learning about another culture, this is an excellent film, one of the best kaiju-films you'll ever see.",positive
The Monster,"Excessive flashbacks, too much screaming...the point was received very early on that their relationship was heavily strained (even BEFORE the actual ""monster"" encounter) and a monster that literally looked like a man in a black trash bag...The total lack of respect for both leads was way over the top.SPOILERS:Additionally, please explain how the youngest of the protagonists gets the better of the monster, when several adults lack ANY capacity; and they just seem to passively allow the ""monster"" to maul, rob, and destroy?

The Monster,"Just watched this and loved it. Another smart addition to the encouragingly robust genre of smart and allegorically innovative horror movies. My take? The monster is simply Kathy's addiction, as experienced by daughter Lizzy. it attacks when she's vulnerableit removes people who are there to protect her (Lizzy's father (the actual addiction)/ the tow truck guy and the paramedics (the metaphorical monster))shining a light on it/ acknowledging it weakens itonce you've acknowledged it, you're in a better place, but you still have to go through withdrawal and might be too damaged to pull through (Kathy vomiting blood in the woods due to her internal injuries)despite your best intentions, innocents will still suffer because of it. (Lizzy undergoes her mother's ""overdose"" and death, and then still has to grapple with the monster on her own.)Finally, the ultimate version of ""shining a light on something"", i.e. setting it on fire, is what allows her to be free, albeit with a forever altered view of her own safety, and the security of the world in general. [ Fun add on-- she had to sacrifice her childhood/ innocence, i.e. her singing teddy bear, in order to finally overcome the monster. ]A lot of people are commenting on the weird/ unbelievable choices made by the characters in the third act. If you're looking at it as a straight up horror movie, I could understand that. But seeing it through the lens of the pretty obvious analogy that was being made about addiction, they all felt totally spot on to me. Definitely recommend!",positive

I was enjoying some great pizza, all was great. But then the entire 3rd act happened. The act that needed to be the strongest. I am not going to reveal any spoilers so I'm just going to say that the ending was unbelievable weak, one of the worst endings I have ever seen. I felt like everyone just gave up towards the end of the movie and rushed to throw a weak ending together. Who was the killer? The hot water heater guy was shaped an awful lot like the killer. I don't know, I just feel completely let down by this ending.",positive

First the buildup of the movie: 30 minutes intro main characters (jawn), 5 minutes cool army base (yeah), 10 minutes zombie chases (tame), 40 minutes locked up in a shop with a lot of singing. The movie contains to much little children to be an adult movie, but the jokes and swearing are to rude to be a children's movie, so what is this for movie? For adults far to childish, for kids to rude. Just don't expect to much humor or zombie action, but a lot of singing, just like that movie Frozen.",negative
Little Monsters,"Just watched this film and really enjoyed it! Ignore some of the lower rated movies, this is just a feel good zombie movie (if there is such a thing).

Polaroid,This show did not have enough light to see it very well so makes it hard to know if it was intentional because of the story or lack of funds to have a light bulb changed.

Polaroid,"I watch horror movies all the time. I watch every horror movie I can get my hands on and most of them are weak and boring. This one, however, is definitely one of the good ones that actually sent chills down my spine from the first few minutes until two thirds into the movie. The third and final act of the movie, which is the climax, was not as effective as the first two acts, because the scare tactics get old, and it becomes more action-oriented and fast-paced. Horror movies are scary when things are slow and allow the fear to build up, which is exactly what you will get in the first two acts. Here's how I would score this:1. story (7, not completely original if you have seen movies such as Shutter, but it had some original elements that I loved)
2. Atmosphere, jump scares and chills (compared to even many high-budget horror films, this gets an easy 8 or 9)
3. Acting (7, way above average for a horror film, but this is no drama, so it doesn't matter if it lacks Oscar-winning performances)
4. cinematography (10, it was very good)
5. Music score (9, it was suspenseful)
6. Twists (4, it did have a good one, but I felt it was a bit rushed)
7. Character stupidity (0, which is the perfect score. The characters in this movie are actually smart and don't make you angry like many other horror movies do)
8. Character development (in reality 3, this is where the movie suffers, but the characters are likable and nice-looking enough to compensate for this aspect a little, so it gets a 5)The people who gave this a low rating fall into four categories:1. People who are too hard to please and only want something like the Ring to get scared.
2. People who don't like horror movies in general.
3. People who haven't seen enough horror movies to actually be able to make a comparison and realize how good this is compared to others.
4. People who were sleepy or distracted.I have to admit I watched this movie during daylight and while I was a bit drowsy (big mistake), but it was so good that it kept sending chills down my spine until I regretted watching it under not-so-perfect circumstances. I would have been terrified otherwise. (A feeling I absolutely love as a horror movie fan).Final verdict: 9

A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night,"Some filmmakers are so masterful they don't need a coherent plot or much of anything to happen on-screen. They hypnotize and memorize us with the basics of film as art, the marriage of moving pictures and sound. Then comes along a little foreign film called A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night.The opening looks like a spaghetti Western yet sounds like a French art film. We immediately like the protagonist. He is patient, determined, likes cats and works hard to get what he wants. Though he is a decent man, he is weak and far from perfect. His trouble starts due to his father's heroin addiction. After the first 30 minutes, his trouble seems to be over. As the film begins to loose our initial interest, it moves slower and slower until it becomes almost painful to watch.The story takes place in Bad City, which is like where the world of David Lynch's Eraserhead meets Sin City. As exciting as that sounds in concept, the lackluster screenplay spoils any hope of excitement. About half way through, the film reveals itself as a love story. However, this lacks the tender magic of Let the Right One In. The characters are interesting enough but the suspense is wondering what this is all building up to. The film hints at a grand finale. A revenge-fueled blood bath of an ending. Unfortunately, it seems writer/director Ana Lily Amirpour wanted to make a Robert Rodriquez/Quentin Tarantino inspired film without any violence.For a horror film, it isn't scary. For a romance, it lacks passion. For a thriller, it is void of any thrills. In the end, it comes off as a piece of pretentious art-house cinema only suited for international film festival audiences. As good as the film looks and as slow as the story moves, it lacks the hypnotic quality of a master like Jim Jarmusch. It literally feels as if the filmmakers ran out of money before they could shoot the finale.This is one of the most unsatisfying and deceiving films ever made. It's like going to a boxing match or UFC fight and the announcer comes out saying, ""Sorry folks, the fighters came to a diplomatic solution and decided violence wasn't the answer. They're off riding bikes under a rainbow now.""",negative
A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night,"Greetings from Lithuania.""A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night"" (2014) is a bizarre experience. It has cool idea and concept is intriguing, although the movie itself isn't. First off all lets make it clear - ""A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night"" is not a horror movie - not at all. It has some horror movie sequences (for 1 min. total) but it's not a horror movie - don't be mislead by wrong advertisement. It's a bizarre and poorly constructed mix of genres stretching from drama, to thriller, to horror to comedy to whatever... - nothing in here works for a compelling picture. Here is the bad word for describing a movie - boring. Yes, this movie is simply boring. For running time 1 h 35 min this movie drags beyond boringness, i was looking at the left time like each 7 min. and honestly - i finished watching this movie in 3 days - seriously.Overall, this flick has had a clearly good idea of creating something unique and unseen, but in my opinion in doing it it failed to make a interesting movie in first place. I can watch whatever there is story if only it's made interestingly, you know, when there is a good script, good acting, directing. This one lacks the good story. It's just a scenes of some sort of vampire going around and killing people who we meet 10 min ago (no spoilers - but they were kinda bad people) - that's it. And then there is a dude with no background or story and a cat. The cat was the best thing in this movie. He should be nominated, while in the mean time the movie should be forgotten.",positive
Jeepers Creepers III,"What were they doing in those 14 years between 2 and 3, staring at their shoelaces? I love the first two films because they are both scary and well made, but WOW, this film is GARBAGE. TRUST ME, this is coming from a HUGE JC fan! The film takes place between the 1st and 2nd movie, which is dumb because nobody wanted to see what happened between the 1st and 2nd movie. I wanted to see what happened after the 2nd movie, but even then, it's really confusing because the plot keeps jumping back and forth between all of these dumb characters. I couldn't tell if the film was set in the present day, in 2001, or in the 70's because of the craptastic pacing. There's even a scene where you can see a 2016 Chevy truck in a film that supposedly takes place in 2001. Speaking of pacing, there is none! Nothing happens in this movie and the film ends right when it should've started! There are so many characters that the film gets lost in itself. The first film had Darry and Trish, simple and easy. The 2nd film had the athletes and a side-plot revolving around an angry father, but it was still easy to follow and well balanced. Here, we have an old lady getting visions from her dead son, then we have Sargeant Tubbs from the first movie, then we have the anti-Creeper gang, then we have some teenagers, then we have a country boy who has a crush on a girl, and said girl also gets her own storyline. All the characters are pointless and are not flushed out because the film is trying so hard to give equal focus to everyone. The CGI is SO BAD and is EVERYWHERE in the film. It's so bad that my theater was laughing louder than the actual movie! The Creeper doesn't do ANYTHING, no smelling fear, eating body parts, he just sorta walks around and grunts. There's one good scene where a group of teenage bikers finds The Creepers truck in the woods, and it's the only good scene in the entire film. That's it! Worst of all, WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE CREEPERS'S ORIGINS!!! I've been waiting nearly 2 decades and we STILL DON'T KNOW WHERE HE COMES FROM??? The film ends on a cliffhanger but I do not want a 4th movie. This feels like it should've been made for the SyFy channel and seeing this on the big screen is like seeing Lake Placid 6 on the big screen. Just don't do it!",negative

It almost looked as if they ran out of money before it was completed. It was very strange. If you are a fan of the first two, you will like to see the characters you love.

""Lots of shocking surprise"".
""Unexpected plot moments"".
""Tension building fabulous"".

""Beginning, a bit disjointed"".
""Slow to establish the storyline"".
""Not long enough for such a good film"".IntroductionThe sequel to the original Creep film is Creep 2. This is a 2017 Thriller/Horror.StorylineThe Creep storyline in this episode, was even more entertaining than the previous one. It has lots of surprises, and plays with your emotions well. By contrast to most horror movies, the plot takes many turns which include positive, aswell as negative, emotions. It also provides real insight into the life of the killer.
This surprised me, and acted as a real hook to stick with it. As far as engaging, the beginning was a little disjointed, but did retain interest. By the middle, the main characters plus their stories were introduced well, bouncing off each other perfectly. The film from middle to end, became more and more edgy. It eventually left me with a surprise finish. Very good overall.GenreThe genre of thriller/horror isn't a bad impression of the film, although (dark thriller), or simply (horror), would perhaps be a better description of what the movie is. I'd class this as a pure and simple serial killer horror. It will thrill you because of the fear factor, as any horror should.
CharactersFrom the word go, there was dramatic, and ""straight to the point"", acting. There wasn't a moment of shyness, or cruising by the actors. They stayed in role very well.The number of characters, whilst restricted, helped to add to the tension in this film. It also enabled their personality and life story, to be understood well. The character personalities resonated well, enhancing the impact of the film. In this respect, viewer emotions were played with constantly. It was a real spectacle throughout. So much so, I felt compelled to scribe this review.As for tension, this was effectively created out of nowhere, with little or no effects. The close up camera shots with lack of special effects, drew me into character perspectives, making the film rather thrilling. One of the scariest elements of this film, was the aspect of sound. This movie didn't require music, as the sounds alone were enough to build tension. The scarcity of sound use, allowed elements of isolation and loneliness to drive fear.MusicMusic was infrequently used, but when it was, it worked well, and was impactful. I was very impressed with the lack of music in this film.
SummaryA short but effective concerto, of emotion and tension at times. A few extra stitches needed to gel the production.

Creep 2,"This sequel was always going to struggle after the first film came out of nowhere and blew people away with how unique it felt. Most of the original Creep generated its atmosphere from the audience's lack of knowledge about the main character and what his actual motivations were. This time we are aware of who he is and what he is about, so while eager to see what happens this time it would be hard to pull off the same magic with a completely similar plot.Luckily the creators knew this and made enough changes to the dynamic, while still basically keeping it in line with the expectations set by the first, to give a fresh feel to the set up. While they kept in most of the unease that made the first Creep great, they also actually delved more into the main character and his backstory, if he is ever to be believed.This possibly more intimate view of the main takes away a small amount of the tension since he has to become more vulnerable and likable, but it is done in such a way where it is still enjoyable and gripping, and events unfold without too much of an obvious conclusion. Overall it is a worthy sequel, if in my opinion not as good as the original, and is well worth a watch.",positive
Terrified,"Yes, it had some good scary moments, production was great. At certain moments I jumped in my seat, but the whole story is just so messed up, its like they didn't even bother figuring out any kind of explanation at the end. The tension building was pretty good, and then when you expext an explanation -the movie just ends and leaves you wondering - what the hell did I just watch?
4/10, and its a shame, this movie could have been so much more...",negative
Terrified,I seen countless horror movies and this one did manage to scare me. Also the plot is very interesting.,positive
Pet,I'll never get back the 1.5 hours of my life hat it took to watch this movie. She was locked in a cage with a lock that was a combination lock. She could have just spent a few hours trying 9999 combinations and gotten herself out.,negative
Pet,"Pet is a strong and disturbing psychological thriller that delves into the depths of the abnormalities to which the human psyche can sink.Once upon a time Seth (Dominic Monaghan) and Holly (Ksenia Solo) used to attend the same school. Poor Seth had a crush on Holly but was too scared to act upon his feelings. Showing that the world is indeed a small place, years later Seth spots Holly on the bus as he's travelling to work and goes over to say hello. Unfortunately, Holly doesn't remember Seth and treats him as though he were a leper.Undaunted by this Seth takes it upon himself to install himself into her life and so starts to stalk her on the internet, making notes of all her likes and dislikes, especially the music she listens too and the places she hangs out...The film has so many depths of feeling from obsession to affection to corruption to love to depravity that, once the twists start coming, it's hard to stop watching.The writer, Jeremy Slater, has done a glorious job of making an unbelievable synopsis into a thoroughly believable story. With the brilliant direction of Carles Torrens, this is brought realistically to the screen.The two actors in the main roles are the ones responsible for holding the script and film together as they, and the characters they create, work really well together and are more than credible as two broken people finding a dark and twisted love.This movie is now one of my favourite thrillers and I would recommend it to all lovers of the twisted mind and twisted plots. It may be awhile before I watch this one again as it has made an impression on me, which is the aim of this type of film, but I will watch this film again.Respect due to all who participated in this film.",positive
Ghost Stories,"There is nothing wrong with the acting or the production of this movie, in fact they are quite good.It's just that it's really, really boring and seem to go nowhere. Also I did not care for any of the characters.I sat through it, because I thought the ending might bring the seemingly unrelated stories together.It actually did, kind of. But in the most uninteresting, far-fetched, cheap and stupid way possible. I was surprised alright, but not in a good way.",negative
Ghost Stories,"Ghost Stories manages to do something horror movies rarely seem to bother with these days: it makes the viewer think. Think about what's on the screen, why it's on the screen and what the meaning of it all is.This is a movie that contains three stories, all of which have very well constructed horror creeps and jumps abound. But, in a case of intentional irony, this is not really a movie about a bunch of creepy horror stories or even whether they're really happening or not.No. Instead it's a psychological journey inside the tortured mind of a rational, intelligent man struggling to deal with many horrors in his own past and present.A lot of very negative reviews here seem to centre on the ending. While the ending isn't a twist we haven't seen before, upon repeat viewings it gets better and better by virtue of so many things hidden in the film. It's a smart conclusion that not only pieces together everything, but it's also the only ending that would have worked given the strong emphasis on rationalism throughout the film.Watching a second time, you'll notice that even the protagonist's reaction to off hand comments by other characters provide insight into his personality, tumultuous past and sad, lonely present.The entire film contains clever clues to the ending throughout and, more importantly, the events that lead to the ending and why they occurred.Don't go into this expecting merely to be scared. Go into this seeing it as a character drama, watch each frame like a hawk and you will see all the excellent subtle details that the people trashing this movie completely missed.",positive
Jessabelle,"Disappointing mystery-thriller that fails utterly as a horror movie (which, from the marketing, I assumed it was). It's not a terribly original movie. There will be plenty of things you see coming a mile away. It also peddles in clichés and stereotypes. It takes place in the South so, per the Hollywood rule book, there has to be a black/white conflict in the story. More specifically, since it takes place in Louisiana, the same Hollywood rule book dictates all the black people practice voodoo. Heaven forbid we try to play against these clichés in 2014. Oh and nobody has a convincing Southern accent here. I guess they watched some episodes of Designing Women and figured they'd nailed it. Sarah Snook does okay but with her big eyes and permanently open mouth, it does make it hard to take her seriously when the movie needs you to. On the plus side, she does display some nice cleavage throughout the movie. So thanks for that. Hated the stuff with the tapes her mom made for her. These scenes have the same air of implausibility that most found footage movies do. It's just unbelievable that someone would do stupid things like make a video of themselves crying and telling their unborn baby ""you're already dead."" Or my favorite: ""You don't know where you are. You don't know who you are. You don't know s**t."" While I'm bitching about things, who digs up a grave in the swamp at night just out of curiosity? Then, once they've done that and found a coffin, who opens it? Freaks, that's who. Whatever the movie has going for it (and there isn't much), it all falls apart in one of the worst endings in recent movie history. It's so dumb and the way Sarah Snook acts will make you laugh out loud. If taken remotely seriously, it's actually kind of offensive. And since the filmmakers saw fit to exploit race for a cheap ""horror"" flick, I'd say you're well within your rights to be offended.",negative
Jessabelle,"Sometimes when watching a supernatural thriller/horror you have to ask yourself 'should I really be scared by what I'm seeing, considering it's completely unrealistic and impossible to ever happen in the real world?' Or the other question that sometimes enters the equation is 'should I really be scared by what I'm seeing or is it all just in the character's mind anyway?' 'Jessabelle' doesn't completely avoid these questions being asked, but it does a great job of disguising the fact that they're there lurking in the background.It's a tense, atmospheric ride from the opening scene right through to the closing credits. Sarah Snook is great as the lead and I couldn't help thinking throughout she might have been great as Carrie in the recent remake of Brian De Palmas classic. The frights are consistent throughout (including a particularly effective bathtub scene) but what really drives it is the story and mystery surrounding it. She isn't simply being haunted for the hell of it, there's a reason and the viewer is left curious to work out what it is. It's all very similar in nature to 'The Skeleton Key' (a personal favourite of mine) with a unique twist to look forward to and an excellent mystery driven storyline. Director (and editor as he's probably better known as) Kevin Greutert is starting to become a personal favourite of mine. Anything he gets his hands on he works wonders with and creates brilliant material.",positive
Attack on Titan Part 1,"A few minutes into the movie I was taken by surprise that the director chose to wildly mash up the characters and their relationships. Even though I really like the anime I was open to a new envisionment of the source material, since prejudice is something I try not to practice. Maybe the director wanted a new interpretation, while maintaining the essence of the series. But then it dawned on me that this new interpretation was leaky at best and the capturing of the essence was a parody. It was a 90 minute crap-fest of half-assed dialog, disinterested story telling and slasher-like violence. The movie also had a particular inability of finding a tone. Any tone. All the scenes feel staged, unreal and almost completely unrelated. Most disturbingly however was the implausibility. Nothing seems connected and nobody related. This is a waste of brilliant source material!",negative
Attack on Titan Part 1,"I had an amazing time at the Fantasia showing of this. The audience went wild. The visuals blew me away. If you like classic Godzilla, or better yet, any of the director's Gamera films, this is for you.Classic film effects ratcheted tension to the breaking point. The cheesy characterization was flawless and intentional. Superb experience on many levels. Also loud, but wonderfully loud.Remember the first tingling of fear when you saw Jurassic Park on the big screen? This is that good.If you are not comfortable with anime rules of exposition and emotional outpourings, you might find the human performances awkward, but the lean story moves things along and all the information you need to know about what kind of vividly portrayed vision of hell is going down is amply provided.This is a funhouse horror show.Most of us at the screening loved the melodrama. That's what sometimes works with giant monsters eating human beings and gobs of blood and flesh raining down and oozing out the windows.This movie is dark and grinds away into some truly discomforting terror moments, even as it careens around spiral roads of goofiness at dizzying speeds.If you liked the throwback elements of Fury Road, the classic effects techniques of this giant monster nightmare might appeal. Visually and sonically it was a huge thrill and totally unique. See it big.Does everything work? Who cares. I don't go to the circus for Shakespeare or some huge subtext feast on Netflix.I go to the circus to feel my heart pound as my head explodes.Thank you big screen for staying real.(PS. I think everything works, but I'm no pickier than I need to be to enjoy the ride, and this one's worth it.)",positive
Amityville: The Awakening,"A mother and her two kids move into the Amityville house. There's the teen daughter, Belle, the younger daughter Juliet, the dog. The mom's got a sister too. No men allowed pretty much. Oh, well, there's James, but he's in a coma and kept home. It's Belle's senior year of course and while everyone knows she lives at the Amityville house, she doesn't now anything about it. Until a classmate tries to befriend her and tells her all about the place but because he's male he's the butt of jokes and treated like crap by Belle and some other girl he introduces her to.Back at the house, the dog barks at stuff, there are shadows, there are pesky flies and Belle starts having vivid nightmares about James. We learn that James is in a coma because of a fight he got into defending Belle, so she is bizarrely held responsible by the mother. There's some type of magic circle still around some area of the front lawn somehow.Even though the doctor and most of the family think that James is in a coma for good, the mom, who gave up religion because of this situation, is convinced James will recover. And sure enough he does, at a rather amazing pace. The kids suspect James might be possessed and they are right. So somehow Belle will have to save the family before as the fully recovered James goes homicidal.Even for a PG-13 horror movie, Amityville: The Awakening, is remarkably dull, lame, uninteresting. It's hard to connect with the arrogant Belle. Much of the characters' behavior is nonsensical. Worst of all, there is zero sense of dread, nothing is really at stake here. It's 10 minutes before the movie ends that finally things become deadly. By then of course it's way too late to get some excitement going. Not to mention that this movie doesn't even look good. It's the kind of movie where it's pitch black most of the time and none of the characters think about turning a friggin' light on. Darkness alone doesn't make a horror movie, let alone a good one. The only frightening thing about this movie is how bad it is.",negative
Amityville: The Awakening,"After four or five years of countless problems in pre and post production, trying so desperately to get released this movie finally does...in one of the saddest ways that is pretty unbecoming of something that fought so hard for so long, by throwing it out digitally for free, plus with a severely limited theatrical release later on....wow. The story is about a teenage girl named Belle (played by Bella Thorne) and her family that move into the Amityville house. Her family consists of her mom (Jennifer Jason Leigh), her little sister (Mckenna Grace) and her twin brother who is in a coma for two years (Cameron Monaghan). From there, freaky things start to occur around the house to the point where Belle isn't sure what is real anymore. Within a short amount of time of moving into the house with a terrifying past, it appears that her comatose brother's state begins to improve; however the tensions between Belle and her mother increase, making us wonder where the real threat lies in the family. Her possibly possessed brother or the mother that refuses to let anything stop her from making the family whole again.Anyways, after all of this time of waiting and wondering what could be so wrong about this movie to warrant such a long hold on this production and I am still not entirely sure what the problem was. It's mostly fine. There are some problems with it for sure; particularly some scenes that are fairly obvious re- shoots/additional content filmed and edited in at a later date from initial production; because there are characters that practically have nothing to do with the plot aside from providing needless exposition about things we already know and also declaring that the ""Amityville Horror"" film franchise exists as movies in this movie's universe...that's perplexing to say the least. I mean, why? That's just confusing and also is something that kind of makes the lead character look dumb for not knowing about the Amityville house since the movies exist in her reality. I am curious as to what these 're- shoot' scenes had replaced, because I feel like there was probably some more material that delved into the relationship between the family or maybe the medical investigation going on with the brother, but was unfortunately cut and replaced with some pointless characters and uninteresting dialog.Also there are some disturbing themes that the movie very briefly introduces, but does not flesh them out or resolve them in much of a satisfying way. Plus there is a sequence about halfway into this movie that feels out of place or cut incorrectly because a certain 'scare' occurs in this movie that involves the youngest sister, but then is completely dropped and forgotten literally in the next shot. It was jarring. There is editing like that which pops up here and there, but is never too terrible to enrage or confuse too drastically.Aside from the gripes I've listed, I will say that this movie is still mostly fine. It has a decent enough story with decent enough characters. There's nothing groundbreaking in terms of its writing, but it works enough to carry itself along in its very short run time. The actors all do well in their roles, especially Jennifer Jason Leigh who has to play this mother at her wits end in her attempts to bring her son out of his vegetative state and will do anything to make that happen. There are times where she feels legitimately intimidating without playing it over-the-top. The majority of the scares work pretty well, particularly since this movie focuses more on character and plot and less on jump scares, even though there are some that happen from time to time. Luckily the jump scares that do happen aren't many, nor all that badly handled. In my opinion, this is an okay movie; it has enough character development, story, scares and atmosphere to hold itself up. I feel that it has had a lot of fluctuation over the years in its quality and it may have been better if it hadn't gone through all those years of post-production hell. Comparing it to other films that have gone through similar experiences though, I will say it is probably one of the better examples of its kind. So if you give this movie a shot then you'll most likely watch it and be fine with going about the rest of your day. It won't stick in your mind as anything great, but a serviceable flick. Sometimes that's all you need from a little horror movie around Halloween time.",positive

Mom and Dad,"On the face of it, MOM AND DAD is an oddball horror film about parents who suddenly and inexplicably turn into homicidal maniacs but only with respect to their own children.However, I'm frankly astounded at the number of reviewers, professional and amateur alike, who seem, from my perspective, to completely fail to ""get"" what MOM AND DAD is all about. In order to explain myself I'll have to depart from my normal style of movie review.Once upon a time, very long ago, cheap 'n' cheesy horror pictures of the drive-in theater variety had a certain unmistakable ""style"" to them. To really grasp this style would require viewing a collection of such movies to get a ""feel"" for them, but in lieu of that I'll give a list of common characteristics possessed by such films.The basic presentation could only be called ""lurid"", outlandish and over-the-top. Lower quality film stock was usually employed to reduce production costs, making the movie look sort of blurry and mushy, bordering on the out-of-focus. The sound was usually of poor quality, oversaturated and dull and featuring a narrow frequency range. A lot of the music had the sense of being canned and stock, often jarringly orchestral, sometimes almost drowning out the dialogue and sound effects and feeling inappropriate to the scene, almost like the music you would hear in porno flicks of the time, just sort of stuck on. There's almost always a consistent overuse of the low angle up-shot, giving many scenes and characters a distorted and menacing look. Shots of people's faces would be far too close up, giving their features a distorted and unpleasant perspective. And so on.MOM AND DAD is, in effect, sort of an ""art-house film"". It is made to be a homage to low-budget horror films from about four decades ago. It takes the setting of present-day and applies the horror filmmaking sensibilities of 40 years ago. And, may I say, in my opinion, it does so perfectly. And, also in my opinion, it should be judged accordingly.The plot line is lurid, ridiculous and absurd. It is SUPPOSED to be lurid, ridiculous and absurd. The plot is merely the Christmas tree upon which the ornaments of style and artistry are hung. It could have been a double feature at the drive-in with ITS ALIVE or perhaps NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD or maybe the original THE BLOB.Hopefully this explains to the reader why I gave MOM AND DAD a 10/10. I judge movies not by their mass appeal but by how well they accomplish what they set out to make, and MOM AND DAD hit its target squarely and I'm guessing it took a great deal of skill and artistic creativity to do it. It is both fun and creepily anachronistic all at the same time.Whether or not I would recommend that you watch it is more determined by who you are as a viewer than anything else. Like regular ""art-house film"" efforts, I would guess it's appeal is very narrow and well-defined. It's attempt to create a work of art is completely uncompromised by any desire to have broad appeal, and so it doesn't. If you're someone who lived through the source era and are down for a bit of nostalgia, if you're a film student or a buff, or if you enjoy exploring filmmaking styles, then you should definitely give this movie a watch. But if you're, say, a millennial who is thoroughly and permanently shackled to your me-only, now-only myopic mindset, you're not going to be able to grasp the point of making such a movie let alone enjoy it.On a final note, one particular scene of MOM AND DAD, literally perfect in every way and one of the funniest things I've ever seen, was one in which Nicholas Cage has just been subjected to an explosion by his kids, who are simply trying to protect themselves from his inexplicable homicidal rage. Cage reappears after the explosion looking much the worse for wear and sporting several Froot Loops stuck to his face from the explosion. This tableau captured every element of the plot, the style, and the point of the film in a single image. Anything other than Froot Loops would not have been so perfect. If this is not the image for the poster, it definitely should have been.",positive
Malevolent,"The lead actress might as well have been a wooden plank. Talked and acted monotonously throughout (even when she should be scared).

Stonehearst Asylum,"Most of the reviews including those from IMDb members will emphasize how you don't see these sort of films anymore, they hark back to the Vincent Price or Hammer Films of the 60s.That's true, but the REAL STORY is that WHAT YOU REALLY DON'T SEE ANYMORE are films that polarize the audience as much as this one does.Brad Anderson, who has a spotted career with moments of sheer brilliance, appears to have made the most dangerous error a director can make -- he fell in love with a story based on setting and mood (a Poe tale) simply because of the aforesaid setting and mood, and COMPLETELY FORGOT this was a film medium, where setting and mood are just not enough.To be clear the setting and mood are brilliantly done but that is all this film offers. The story proceeds as slowly as a fly crawling up a drape, a great cast is wasted, and the trope where ""the inmates are running the asylum"" is so overdone it has become a cliché.",negative

Final Girl,"SPOILERS This film left me with a lot of questions and I've come to realize that the answer to every single one of them is ""because it is a dumb and senseless movie."" Here are a few for you to sample: How did these murderers who are in high school kill William's wife and daughter over ten years ago? Did they kill them when they were 6 years old? Why doesn't William just kill them himself or turn them into the police? Why are they waiting ten years to train this little girl while other women are being murdered when they already know who the killers are and could stop them? Why does Veronica have a crush on William? He adopted her when she was a little girl and is basically her father. Isn't this messed up? Why does William tickle her? That was so weird! Why do they choke out that random guy at the bar? Why can't she just shoot them? If a gun without bullets is a paperweight why can't she just take more bullets? Why isn't she allowed to wear shoes? If she's going to drug them why can't she just poison them? What woman in their right mind would wear formal attire and drive into the woods with four men they just met? Why does it take her so long to kill these bozos when she's been training for ten years and they are drugged? Why is this guy so scared of pandas? I thought she wasn't allowed to use a gun so why does William shoot the last guy? Why didn't he shoot them ten years ago? If he was there the whole time with a gun why was he letting her try and fist fight them to death when he could have easily killed them? Who made this movie? Who reviewed the script and thought ""this is good""? How was this disaster ever made?",negative
Final Girl,"The early reviews for Final Girl are disgusting to say the least. I feel these days the audience gets less appreciative of films and more stupid. Final Girl is a fine example of a beautifully made independent film.A great cast of young actors. Abigail Breslin delivers another solid performance. Alexander Lukin brings a great chilling menace to the story. The cinematography is incredible. Those who complain that it wasn't lit properly cannot see what the film was trying to do. They did the lighting style for a reason. Over lit, artificial yet astounding and eye catching. It had a great story that pulled me in from the start. Really don't understand the complaints and hate. It's like everyone was expecting a big budget over the top Hollywood film......these days the typical audience doesn't appreciate independent films.....this film was awesome and if you like independent art films that were shot beautifully with great visuals and stylised lighting, I recommend checking Final Girl Out.",positive
The Belko Experiment,"The Belko Experiment is a nasty, gory, chaotic little horror film that pits an office building full of co-workers against each other in a bloody battle of last man/woman standing. This much you probably already know from the trailer. It's a plot that can be succinctly surmised on a cocktail napkin so it's not like you need much to prime you for what's to occur. What they don't tell you however is The Belko Experiment is a nasty, gory and chaotic little horror film without a center. Hunger Games (2012) meets Office Space (1999)? More like Severance (2006) meets a sad, angry teenager's school shooting fantasy.We catch our first glimpse of our inevitable victims within hours of the titular experiment. There's the office Jim and Pam (Arjona), a couple of one-trick pony side characters that might just make it to the second act (Gunn, Brener, Del Rio), the obvious District 2 sociopaths (Goldwyn, McGinley, Yeoman) and, of course, the mousy office Milton (Diaz) who's just so excited to be starting her first day at the office. It's obvious within the first five minutes which archetypes are going to make it to the top ten, the question becomes, will the other seventy or so office drones be in on the fun or not.Without spoiling too much for the misguided Purge (2013)-o-philes who still want to watch this trash, I'm sorry to say that The Belko Experiment errs on the side of seriousness and pessimism instead of black comedy or pressure-cooker sensationalism. Any lurid fun that can be had at the expense of cubicle flunkies taking out long-seeded frustrations on their managers or visa versa takes a back seat to the actions and motivations of a selective few who camp out on their respective floors hatching their schemes. The films creativity (or lack thereof) is so markedly uninspired that it might as well write ""You'll Get the Point and Little Else Within the Hour"" in big banner lettering.As chaos looms, factions quickly form. Not so much organically, but more as a way of sussing out the good guys from the bad for the sake of the story. Representing team ""give a s**t"" is the amiable Mike (Gallagher) who walks through the blood splattered cork-board of Belko Industries with a halo around his head despite being a bit of an airhead. He's the kind of guy who'd tell everyone to take the stairs instead of the elevator because it's safer. He's the kind of guy who is a salt and pepper mustache away from being Sully Sullenberger; a goody-two-shoes whose persona is so mundane and diametrically opposed to any of the larger-than-life villains that it just reeks of lazy characterization.On the other side of the divide is Barry (Goldwyn) who is ""open to all options,"" so long as those options leave him in control. His arc is a little more nuanced than Mike's but given his title and the company that he keeps, I'm amazed the audience's goodwill got as far as the building's dirt parking lot. We all know he's bad and every discussion had in the building cafeteria mulling over what do to is shaded by his badness - life and family be damned.They're all damned really, though because the lions share of the office has little to no say on how they meet their demise it never seems to matter all that much. The fact that the movie literally lines people up for the slaughter should tell you all you need to know about how repetitive this movie is. For real: Battle Royale (2000), a film with five times more protagonists, still managed to stuff in more plot, meaning and dignity into its story than this film managed to imbue in twelve floors and a murder of recognizable character actors.The Belko Experiment is a grim, mean, repetitive, slog of a movie that takes all the moral, psychological and political subtext of James Gunn's high-concept and smashes them like watermelons bracing against Gallagher's sledge-o-matic. The ends of this cruel little experiment hints at a sequel, the results of which may give this movie some closure. As of now however, the message I heard loud and clear by the end of this mess was, ""watch this movie, and we'll make three more just like it."" Rise above people, rise above.",negative
The Belko Experiment,"Let's get one thing out the way: this is horror for the masses, in the worst possible meaning of such definition. It's domesticated, neutered, lowest common denominator, watered down horror at its worst and, as such, is a bar lowerer for the whole genre.With that said, here's a list of adjectives and definitions that passed through my mind while I was watching this: unfocused, half-baked, hypocritical, unrealistic af, lame, predictable, stupid to the point of being downright offensive, heavy handed, useless. Mostly hypocritical (for what it tries to say about ""human nature"") and useless, anyway.The only positives are that is generally well acted (with a tragic waste of John C. McGinley) while featuring some beautiful shots (nothing to write home about, though) and it's not shy on gore (for a mainstream movie). These, along with some humor here and there, are the only reason why I'm giving it 4/10 instead of 1.The story has been done to death in countless other movies, novels, short stories, comic books, TV shows and video games (so, for the geniuses claiming this is a rip-off of danganronpa: yeah, no. That game is as much as rip off of other, better things, than this is). If you want some examples of movies that do the same kind of storyline, only way better than this: ""Cube"" (1997), ""The Experiment"" (both the German original, 2001 and the American remake, 2010), ""The Mist"" (2007) or any adaptation of ""Lord of the Flies"", really.",positive
The Voices,"This film tries to be way too many things. Ryan from the get-go does not play any sort of average likable Joe. At least from our viewing point it is clear from the start that Ryan is playing one very sick puppy while surrounded by voices, we know all too well are his and his alone, coming from his four legged friends. The synopsis mentions that the story""...takes a sudden, murderous turn..."" but, as noted, from the start we know this is one very sick guy. The synopsis also mentions his court appointed shrink and then there are the 'meds' he is not taking. What is lacking is any real story other then a known psycho going psycho. No back story, no character development, no drama, no suspense and so not for me entertaining. Slasher shocks, OK on that one but not enough for this viewer. This was way too close to garish headlines involving the next door neighbor harboring a murderous psycho pastime. There is very little if anything funny in this film. Cat and dog mouthing a deranged killer's words does not reach the funny bone. All in all a dark, humorless, murderous mess.",negative
The Voices,"I've always liked Ryan Reynolds starting with his early Canadian work but even having read the tag line, never in a million years did I see this one coming. What a wonderful surprise. The Voices is a brilliant film about schizophrenia that balances horror and comedy with such aplomb you forget that what's happening on the screen isn't exactly healthy or good. Gemma Arterton joins Mr Whiskers and Bosco in some of the most entertaining internal conflicts to be shown on screen in years. Mr Whiskers hilariously confirms our deepest and darkest fears about cats while Bosco is the voice of reason. Let's be clear about this, Jerry is deeply disturbed and he needs help but that doesn't keep you from being sucked into his strange world. His life in the real world at the bathtub factory hides a whole lot of crazy going on in his head. Jerry at his core is happy there and he likes his co workers, too bad about the little accident that starts it all going down hill.If you like your comedy strange, you too will be a fan of this film. From the basic premise of talking animals to the happy joy joy feeling Jerry gets when his ""problems"" seem to go away, all the way to the end you will be smiling at how good the story is. And what an end, you know it's going there and you know it's all for the best, he's after all a good guy and does the only thing he can. His reward? well you have to watch all the way to the end. But I do promise you this, you'll be wanting to dance to very possibly the most uplifting song since somebody serenaded a man eating plant.Don't let this one pass you by.",positive
Leatherface,"I'm shocked at the amount of good reviews thus far. There's the first 10 minutes of this film... then there's the last 10 minutes... NOTHING in between contributed to an acceptable origin story of Leatherface. We got a brief look at his childhood (first 10 min)... eventually we learn how he became disfigured (last 10 min)... but how he became this giant, semi-mute, monster... there's NOTHING about this story-line that explains this or gives us ANY additional insight. For the most part we find out what we already knew (in the first 10 min)... his entire family is sadistic and insane... THAT'S how he became Leatherface... not anything you're going to see here.This was nothing but an attempt to tell a story that ultimately has nothing to do with the origin of Leatherface. The leap from how this guy became Leatherface is astronomical and nonsensical. What we already knew was sufficient and should've been the focus of an origin film. THIS was just an opportunity to take advantage of a successful franchise with a story that was FORCED to tie into the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Complete with a bunch of forced twists and turns in attempt to appear to have more depth than it actually does. This was pure garbage and the only thing good about it was Lili Tayler, who wears ""psychopath"" very well.Look for me on Twitter and YouTube for audio reviews.

Leatherface,"Saw this recently on a DVD. Having enjoyed Bustillo n Maurys previous works (Inside, Livid n Among the living) n having seen all the seven parts of TCM, i was looking forward to this. Well, i wasn't disappointed. Surprisingly i got more than i bargained for. As a fan of road horror/thriller movies, this movie turned out to b a perfect combo. The film is suspenseful, tensed n at times brutal, the film will keep u guessing who's Leatherface. The movie succeeded in paying homage to: 1)There is a psychotic couple on the run who kills people mercilessly a la Natural born killers. 2)There is a bonding between two boys in which one fella takes care of the other deranged fella a la Of Mice and men. 3)There is a cop who is hell bent on revenge from a deranged family a la Devils rejects. 4)This is indeed a befitting prequel a la Hannibal Rising, explaining the story of the young Leatherface's evolution into a deranged killer. 5)It does have shades of One flew over the cuckoos nest. 6)There is a scene which is similar from the Revenant n another brutal scene from another film.... The previous prequel showed him as a mentally n deformed face fellow who just kills but this prequel showed a proper descent into madness n the trauma at a young age which does make for a more entertaining origin story. While the 1974 original will forever be a classic without showing on screen violence, this film does have some very brutal violence but not the kind of gore which is there in the remake n the its prequel. Surprisingly good star cast n solid acting by Dorff n Taylor.",positive
Insidious: Chapter 3,"Oh my. I have to be honest here, I found the first Insidious hilarious, as it wheeled out every spook house trope in the history of horror cinema and then topped it off with a cameo by Darth Maul (as we all know), so I avoided part two like the plague as I really didn't need any more old Amityville throwbacks in my movies. So now its part 3 and a friend dragged me (quietly) kicking and screaming to see it and I honestly did hope things had improved. But.... Nope. This was quite easily much, much worse than the first one. For a start its a long time before anything even happens apart from some silly muddy footprints around a house and some dreadful SFX which are nothing more than actors covered in some grey greasepaint. The acting is incredibly hammy with heaps of cheesy dialogue (that guy from Sex & The City being the worst) then its time to bring in (wait for it.........) the paranormal investigation team!!! Yes, it's really THAT original. Once again we have a plot development used in like 1000 ghost house movies since time began (yawnnn) and I find it incredible how anyone can find any of this horrible tosh original. On then to a (much expected seance) and the ham and cheese really gets ramped up. I mean who are the audience for Insidious? They clearly know little about horror of the past (you just can't know anything and not see this film as rehashed dirge). I saw films exactly like this in the 1970s for goodness sake. But hey, maybe this film is for the newbies, maybe I'm missing the point. But for anyone else this is a tired, played to death, remake of a pile of old dusty movies that most of us really don't need to see again. Insidious is about as original as acne and I certainly enjoyed playing spot the movie watching it. And guess what? Darth Maul appears again. Yay!! We missed him (you gotta wait til the end though).",negative
Insidious: Chapter 3,"Without a doubt, this movie is the king of all the Insidious movies. I feel like this is undoubtedly due to the fact that it makes you all at once feel horrified and sad, while also having mild undercurrents of comedic relief. This movie has way more substance than all the others in the franchise. For instance, I actually felt a connection to the characters in this movie. The tension between the father and daughter was so intense that it was palpable. I found myself feeling sorry for the father for having to carry such an emotional burden while also feeling bad for the daughter for basically having to take on the maternal role in the household. I can honestly say that the first two movies didn't do that great of a job at making me feel any emotions resembling sympathy toward the protagonists. My favorite part about this movie was that it really tugged at the old heart strings. As one having dealt with the loss of many loved ones over time, I understand the deep desire to reach out to them from beyond the grave. Somehow the subject of a teenage girl wanting to contact her deceased mother made the old wounds of my own personal losses feel fresh. Toward the end of the movie, I found my eyes welling up with tears. I can honestly say walking out of the theater, I felt like it was a great ten bucks spent.",positive
The Girl with All the Gifts,"I know many of you reading this probably won't care, because of the praise this movie is getting, but this is one of the most blatant rip offs I have seen in recent memory.Let me recap: The story involves a post apocalyptic setting where a strain of Cordyceps fungus has mutated. Infecting most of the population, turning them into violent mutated zombie like humans who attack and eat anyone and anything. The fungus is transmitted through bites, but the longer humans are infected they can begin to spread the disease by becoming immobile and beginning sprouting pods that shoot spores into the air, spreading the fungi even more. But years after the infection begins we find a girl. A special girl who is immune to the effects of the fungus. A group searching for a cure learns of the girl and wants to bring her to a center/base to use her to create the cure. She has a protector that starts off looking after her as just a job, but begins to care for her. But then her protector learns that creating the cure with the help of this special girl involves killing her. Now they have to decide if they can live with sacrificing her to save the world. And now you have the full plot of The Last of Us. A critically acclaimed and award winning video game that came out in the summer of 2013. A full YEAR before the book was even published. Could this be a coincidence? Sure. Maybe. But come on...This gets a 1 star for being a complete rip off and doing it worse than the video game. If it wasn't a rip off it would be an OK movie at best.",negative
The Girl with All the Gifts,"I remember once having a ridiculous drunken dispute at a works Christmas party many year's ago that went along the lines of ""if you had the chance to save the world, but had to kill your child to do it, what would you do"". There's a variant of this conundrum at the heart of this brilliant new film from Colm McCarthy, best know for his TV work on shows like ""Peaky Blinders"", ""Sherlock"" and ""Dr Who"".As most people already realize, this is a 'Zombie film' (cue, a number of other single blokes in the cinema) and illustrates the dangers of not treating that Athlete's Foot as soon as it appears! I would normally provide a quick synopsis here, but I really think this is a case in point where it is best to go into the film as blind as possible to the story and let it envelop you. (This includes not watching the whole trailer if possible.) To merely set the scene, we open with a morning school ritual like none you've seen before: children strapped to wheelchairs by heavily armed military in their cells; wheeled to an underground classroom; then made to sit in serried rows being taught by their teacher Helen Justineau (a deliciously un-made-up and natural Gemma Arterton). What IS going on? Who ARE these children? WHY are the soldiers so scared and dismissive of them? The ever-great Paddy Considine (""Pride"") plays army Sergeant Parks (who also has a bit of a crush on Helen) and Glenn Close plays Dr Caroline Caldwell, who is studying the children in more ways than one.This trio of stars, supported notably later in the film by Fisayo Akinade as the trooper Kieran, turn in what is a superb ensemble performance. As for Glenn Close, I have never quite been able to shake her awful ""silk blouse"" performance in ""Air Force One"" from my mind, but here she is quite mesmerizing in the role of the Doctor on a mission: I would suggest a career best. Her final scene reflects such a complex range of emotions, and is brilliantly executed. And Gemma Arterton pulls out all the emotional stops in what is also one of the performances of the year.But good as these performances are, they would be nothing without the central performance of young Sennia Nanua as the titular ""Girl"". I have made the point before that there should be an Oscar category for ""Young Actors"" rather than pitch them into the adult categories like Quvenzhane Wallis and Anna Paquin were (successfully). Here in her debut feature performance Sennia is just mesmerising and (provided this film gets the recognition it justly deserves) she should be a shoe-in for the BAFTA Rising Star award next year, if not an Actress nomination. A young lady most definitely to watch.Also assuming a starring role is Chilean-born composer Cristobal Tapia de Veer's astonishingly effective music which drives up the tension superbly. This is his feature film debut and another name to watch.The screenplay by Mike Carey from his original novel is beautifully crafted, with some great one liners dropped in to ease the tension a notch. And the story adds a level of emotional depth and angst that surpasses other films of this genre, at least as far back as the ""28 Days"" films.Astonishingly, the film was made on a budget of 4 (FOUR!) Million Pounds, giving it a 'BvS quotient' (see bob-the-movie-man.com!) of 2.1%!! Every penny of that budget is up on the screen, and whilst you might like to pick at a few of the matte paintings and effects, it is a remarkably achievement in special effects (Nick Rideout is the SF supervisor) and production value.So, its great! Go see it... but with a few caveats: it is a zombie film, and it ranks about an 8.9 on the splattometer scale, which might not be to some tastes; definitely don't go to see it if you are pregnant (though I am constantly reminded how I took my heavily pregnant wife in 1989 to see ""A really great film called 'Alien'""); and you might want to avoid it if you are a great cat or dog lover, or indeed a pigeon-fancier. Other than that, get yourself down to a multiplex and see this great British film: surely a classic to be recognized for years to come.(You can read the full graphical version of this review on bob-the-movie-man.com.

47 Meters Down,"One of the first things taught in film school is if you can show the audience, don't tell them. That is why most voice overs are not necessary and exposition scenes bring most films to a screeching halt. 47 Meters Down commits the sin of not only showing us things, but having characters make sure we know what we are seeing by repeating what is being shown. Case in point: One character is swimming along the ocean floor and spots a spear gun. It is obviously a spear gun. Only an idiot would not know this is a spear gun. The character then feels the need to say, ""There is a spear gun."" This happens throughout the film. The air tank reads low, ""I am almost out of air."" A giant shark swims by, ""Look there is a shark."" When this film comes out on video, it would make a great drinking game. Whenever someone repeats what is shown on screen, take a shot. No one will be conscious by the end of the film. Skip this movie. It is awful.",negative
47 Meters Down,"I love shark movies, lately all the shark movies coming out have been lacking intensity, entertainment & a realistic feeling. And then there is IN THE DEEP, I saw The Shallows and I liked it don't get me wrong. In the deep made me more than like it, it left me dazed. Don't worry I won't spoil the movie for those that haven't seen it. All I can say is this movie is defiantly worth a watch. Kudos to the director for making the scenes so intense and edge of your seat. Also the tones of the movie were perfectly set and gave you chills. The ending was crazy!Two sisters on Mexican vacation are trapped in a shark observation cage at the bottom of the ocean, with oxygen running low and great whites circling nearby, they have less than an hour of air left to figure out how to get to the surface.",positive
Sinister 2,"Sinister is one of my favorite horror films from the past few years, so when the reviews for this sequel started coming out, I was really disappointed. I mean, it has a 13% on Rotten Tomatoes at the time that I'm writing this. But after going into the movie with an open mind, I actually thought it was surprisingly solid, a whole lot better than the reviews would have you believe.When Sinister 2 was originally announced, I was pretty skeptical. The original focused so heavily on a mystery that was solved by the end, so how do you make another one when we already know what's going on? C. Robert Cargill and Scott Derrickson pull that off by offering something totally different that still feels familiar. We follow the madness from a child's perspective this time, and that allows us to explore the rules of this universe in a really interesting way. In the first one we're begging for the Oswalt family to leave the house, but this time, we're begging for the family to stay in it. The formula is flipped around a bit, and while still being structured around a collection of film reels, Sinister 2 feels different enough to justify its existence.It's also quite creepy just as the original movie was, although the atmosphere isn't as bleak and relentless this time. A whole lot of scenes take place during the day and just consist of a lot of dialogue, and it was definitely missing the Scott Derrickson touch in some places. Sinister 2 also relies on jump scares a bit more than its predecessor did, and in fact nearly every single scare in the movie is accompanied by a loud noise. They all worked on me, so I didn't mind too much, but I wish I could say the scares in this one were as inventive as they were the last time.But overall, Sinister 2 does a really solid job of building on the first one. The plot is far more interesting than I expected, James Ransone and Shannyn Sossamon are both great, and the film reels themselves are all pretty fantastic (except for one that goes a bit over the top and just looks silly, but I won't spoil it). Best of all, while Mr. Boogie gets more screen time here, I never felt the added exposure made him any less terrifying, and luckily the franchise hasn't gone the Halloween route of explaining too much. No, it's not as good as the original, but if you enjoyed that movie as much as I did, you should have a good time with Sinister 2.",negative
Sinister 2,"Review: Although I quite enjoyed the first movie, I found it hard to get into this one. The creepy twins, Zach (Dartanian Sloan) and Dylan (Robert Daniel Sloan), didn't seem that surprised with all of the extremely weird episodes that were happening in the house and the director made a right mess of the storyline, which didn't seem to flow properly. The dark theme and airy scenes, did bring some intensity to the movie but it takes ages to get going and I personally lost interest after a while. The ex-deputy (James Ransone), who is investigating the brutal murder of a famous author and his family, doesn't help the flow of the movie and while he is piecing together the evidence about the murders, the kids father is trying to get custody of his kids, from his ex-wife Courtney Collins (Shannyn Sossamon), who put in an average performance. By the time the whole story came together at the end, I really didn't know what the hell was going on but I was glad that it was over. The unheard of actors and poor script, made this feel like your everyday ""straight to DVD"" type of movie but the first movie was a big hit, so this sequel made a hefty profit at the box office, even though it didn't deserve to. After watching it twice, just in case I missed something really interesting, I was still disappointed, so it has to get the thumbs down from me. Disappointing!Round-Up: Although I haven't seen James Ransone, 36, before, he did star in 12 episodes of the Wire, Inside Man with Denzel Washington, The Next Three Days with Russell Crowe, The Son of No One, the first Sinister, Oldboy, Empire State and Broken City, and he has also made appearances in various TV series like Treme, Hawaii Five-0, Law & Order etc, but I personally don't remember his face in any of those movies, so he obviously didn't make a big impact. Anyway, the movie was directed by Ciaran Foy, who made Citadel in 2012. I can honestly say that I didn't like what he done with this sequel and the whole, ""kids seeing dead people"" theme, just didn't work for me.Budget: $10million Worldwide Gross: $53millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their horror/mystery/thrillers starring James Ransone, Shannyn Sossamon, Robert Daniel Sloan, Dartanian Sloan, Lea Coco and John Beasley. 2/10",positive
Come to Daddy,"It was a slow start, never picks up and unfortunately any potential was wasted, with the most horrific thing about this movie being it's god awful writingAn endlessly shocking thrill ride it was not, the on screen violence probably had a total run time of 2 mins, and the actions of some of the characters makes little sense other than to progress the poor excuse for a storysome of the actions and inaction of the characters is mindless, it all feels so linear and unnatural.You get an uneasy feeling due to the dialogue of some characters but it never goes anywhere, they make no other appearance and don't help the plot either, only serving as bizarre red herrings,It feels like the Director desperately wants to create a cult film and figured by having odd characters, strange dialogue, good cast, obscure violence and throwing everything at the wall that something will stick and perhaps some people actually do see all these elements and are fooled into believing its so weird it must be good, this also gives the Director a great out when It comes to criticism as he can claim he didn't want to be conventional, however it all comes off as arrogant and pretentious.The cast is fantastic and fantastically wasted here, I thoroughly enjoyed 'A field in England' featuring Michael Smiley which really was a dark and thrilling low budget featuring film.Unremarkably NZ media appears unable to give the film a negative review as it seems the director is a treasure in the industry and their reviews certainly let you know it, as well as how horrifying, brilliant and shocking the film is, an if it wasn't the unforgivable garbage that it is, there's actually many films that do low budget over the top violence well such as 'Brawl in cell block 99' 'Green Room' or the firefly trilogy,the violence in this film however is exclusively brief and intended to shock, like a cheap joke,
Seriously don't waste you're time on this oneI conclude this is a very conceited film which never gets off the ground, nothing about it is nuanced, the humor is sparse, but this does nothing to save its clunky pacing and terrible story and writing",negative
Come to Daddy,"(The Wellington premiere with Ant Timpson and Emma Slade giving Q&A)O.M.G. That was, as expected, an Incredibly Strange movie. (Ant Timpson is best known in New Zealand for the Incredibly Strange film festival, which began in 1994 with the likes of Plan Nine from Outer Space.)Elijah Wood's character, Norval, is aptly named. He is an innocent nerd, called to visit his estranged-since-childhood father at a remote and beauiful house on the shore of Vancouver Island. The father (Stephen McHattie) is creepy from the get-go (think Jack Nicholson in The Shining). I'll say no more but nothing is as it seems and the movie is a roller coaster ride of extreme tension and release, extreme violence, and a generous slab of (black, of course) comedy. Just suspend your belief enough to erase the words ""We've got to get you to hospital"" from your memory.I didn't stay for all the Q&A because they talked at length about technical details, but Timson based the movie on his own experience with the death of his father, which was Pretty Strange.It'll never be a blockbuster, but it'll be a cult favourite for years to come.",positive
Goodnight Mommy,"Where to start; no story development, no character development, no screen writing, no plausibility = no respect for the viewer's time, intelligence and/or taste. This movie is terrible. You NEVER care about the characters. Worse yet, scene after scene is so undeveloped, with no air of plausibility or interactions that real people would ever do, that you cannot put yourself in the shoes of ANY of the characters in the film. The young boys, to their credit, do the very best they can with this material--and I hope they go on to have careers. But this is 2 hours you will want back, that you'll never get back, if you even get through the film. After 1 hour I had to jump ahead 5-minutes at a time just to see if ANYTHING compelling was going to happen ... it did not ... ever. Just awful.",negative
Goodnight Mommy,"Well this movie caught me completely off-guard. I had no idea what to expect given that this is the very first feature film of Austrian director duo Severin Fiala & Veronika Franz. Goodnight Mommy is about two young twin boys who live in a countryside house with their actress mom, and spend most of their waking hours playing together. Their mother has just had surgery and her face is covered in bandages, rendering her unrecognizable to the twins. They become convinced that the woman who has returned from surgery is not their real mother...and I won't spoil the rest.If you have any interest in cinema as an art form, Goodnight Mommy is an absolute must-see. It is the most beautifully shot film I've seen since Under the Skin. Each shot is framed in such a meticulous and perfectly orchestrated way that you could pause the film at any time and end up with a still worthy of hanging on your wall. I've never seen a director put Venetian blinds to such diverse and good use, especially the nighttime shots of them, it made natural movement look slithery and creepy.The most haunting aspect of the incredible visuals was the approach to the scares, if you can call them that, in the first half of the film. The horror in Goodnight Mommy changes about halfway through, from purely subtle and visual to very unnerving body horror and even gore. Those subtle shots in the beginning reminded me of the old French film Eyes Without a Face. The mother is shown only in her bandages, with the audience having no reference point for what is under there, which helps us imagine the most horrible. She lurks like a monster in dark shadows and in reflections, and it is as chilling as it is beautiful, I enjoyed it immensely.That's not to say I was disappointed when the movie changed direction to the much more macabre in its second half. Exactly the opposite, in fact. The directors handle both subtlety and violence incredibly well, resulting in two entirely different but equally enjoyable halves. This transition also helped keep this very personal, three actor, single location film interesting until the end. It helped it avoid treading similar ground more than once. And oh my god what a second half we have here. The kind of violence the characters commit against each other is so specifically chosen. It may not be the bloodiest or most disturbing ideologically, but it is always acts that are very easy to imagine and relate to, so you actually end up feeling them in your body as if happening to you. This is body horror done right in my opinion.Goodnight Mommy also did something that very few movies dare to do. It interrupted the last third, the most tense part of a movie, with a hilarious 5 minute comedy scene involving some Red Cross workers. It was a big risk considering all the laughing could potentially diminish the impact of the ending once we return to the violence at hand. Instead it played it off masterfully and made the ending seem even more vile juxtaposed against the lightheartedness of that scene. On this note, all the other funny scenes in the film were also excellent. The beginning made me laugh much more than once.The downside is that one of the twists worked really well for this movie BUT was alluded to way too well, so you guess it before the first third is even over. On top of that, it's a twist that's already been done in a not too dissimilar Asian film before, so it is old news for hardcore horror fans. Regardless, this weak hiding may have been intentional since the movie doesn't make that big of a deal out of it in the end. In fact, the twist creates a very clever distortion of your perception of the characters initially, and twists (no pun intended) your expectations of who is up to what. So although not original, it just made the rest of the movie better so I'll accept it as a necessary evil.Goodnight Mommy is one of the strongest horror debut films I've seen. It is stunning body horror, and puts most other films to shame with its cinematography. Well-directed, well-acted, well-everything. An absolute must-see.",positive
Cell,"First... I did not know anything about this awesome, and I can't say that enough, awesome book becoming a movie. I have had to read this book at least 10 times over the last few years and some of my most favorite life quotes came from this book. So when I saw this as a movie and John as the main role I knew it was going to be amazing. I mean if I could cast the main character myself it would be John.BUT... Well, if the director had made a movie out of the book, it would have been amazing. If the movie had any of the most notable and required pieces of the plot it would have been amazing. If the director had even read anything to do with the book, even the dust jacket, it would have been amazing. But he didn't, he didn't, he didn't.SO... The movie sucked. I don't like to use that type of ""language"" when reviewing anything, but there is no other choices here. Everything about the movie was wrong and I gave it a lot of room, a lot of space to make errors and not flow the same. Because ultimately you want to be surprised by the movie. You ultimately want the director to make it his own just a little bit, put his spin on something and have it shine even more. And I did, I watched the movie to the very end. Checked behind the credits and everything. And now I wish I would have gone on for the rest of my life without knowing this movie existed. IF... Now one might think by my review that had you not read the book, you might have liked it but sadly that is not true. This is not only the worst adaptation of a book ever, but it is also just poorly put together, scripted, acted, and there is no redeemable quality anywhere.Such as... The sound effects were horrible, the video tried to be dark and creepy, but it was just bland. There was very little action or scare factor other than some BOO moments from the ""zombies type people."" If you didn't see something coming from a mile away it is because it made no sense. The ending was a little baffling on how horrible it was. I mean I am actually trying to think of one thing. Just one that I can say and would take this movie from a 1 star to at least a 1.5 star. But I can't. I can't think of a single thing that I can look back on and say that was cool/nice/awesome/not terrible.Lastly... So I will leave you with this. I am actually praying that I reach you before you watched this movie. I am hoping one of your not nice friends didn't play a prank on you and made you pay for this movie. It is my desire that this review has reached you before you have wasted one single heartbeat within the vicinity of this horrible, horrible film mistake. And I thank you for reading my review and I am sorry to those that I did not reach in time.Joshua Kyte",negative
Cell,"I must say I don't really understand the negative reviews. I've read and loved the book, but I was always aware that the movie was not going to be an exact copy of it. Yes, people who expected it to be will be disappointed, but don't spoil the fun for others who just want to see a good movie - because it is still a good movie in itself. Giving a movie a bad rating just because it didn't meet your personal expectations is kind of stupid. You should always try to see the movie and book separately. Some scenes, when translated to a movie screen, just don't come out the same way. What sounds amazing in a novel doesn't need to look fantastic in theaters. And that's coming from a writer.Of course, it is a lot harder to make you feel for the characters on a screen than when you read about them in detail. I still felt for the characters. I like that the movie changed a couple of things, but still kept stuff that will remind you of the book (Alice's white dress, the ice cream truck etc....) Some of those book references were used in a different way, but it made me smile. The new ideas were pretty unique and I don't want to spoil the experience. I think the most important parts were still well performed and - last but not least - it was entertaining, interesting, different, suspenseful. 8 Stars - I take two stars away, because some improvements could have been made.",positive
Berlin Syndrome,"Nothing much happens in this movie, except at the very beginning and very end. It's excruciatingly slow and boring. We don't get any insight into the characters, the dialogues are rare and do not serve any interesting purpose. In the end, it's just not enjoyable to watch. I can't think of any reason why someone would want to watch this thing.",negative
Berlin Syndrome,"Wow! This film really builds up the tension. I don't want to say much about the third act, except that I think it was good. I particularly enjoyed the sound design in this film, and how it added so much to the suspense and mystery. I wasn't immediately sold on the actors, but they sort of grew on me. They certainly played their roles well, I just felt like maybe they were lacking a bit of emotional range or chemistry with each other. It didn't detract from what is a truly excellent horror film of its genre. It is brutal, genuinely scary, haunting. You truly feel the hopelessness and anguish of the female character. The sheer dread of her situation. You wonder how you would behave if you found yourself in that same scenario. That's what good horror is all about.",positive
Look Away,"Ok so I see a lot of positive reviews here. It was a good movie in general, good acting etc. but as for originality, people compared it to Carrie, but I go one further and say that it's been done before, Another Me starring Clare Forlani. the story is practically identical. an identical twin dies during delivery and the star gradually is overtaken by her dead twin blah blah blah.
With this movie, I thought the ending was terrible. she went around a killing spree seeming to not care leave fingerprints behind, and after slitting her dad's throat she goes home and gets in mother's bed and cuddles up and The End? Are the cops from Police Squad or something?",negative
Look Away,"As a thriller fanatic, I have to say as I've entitled this, that this movie re-integrates all the codes you have seen previously in this kind of ""mirror and twisted reality"" universe. 
What's good here is the storyline is well built, do not expect jumpscares but instead prepare yourself for some great tension going on. Another great point : All characters have their role and contribution, and btw let salute the acting. I am discovering India Eisley in this movie and can tell this is a pleasant surprise, she carries the film on her shoulder, no doubt about it.
To sum up this is the kind of movie where you hop into within the ten first minutes, and stay stuck until the very end. An enjoyable dark tale, and a nice and wise addition to the genre.",positive
The Blackcoat's Daughter,"I am a huge supernatural horror fan and this film was terrible. The only interesting moments were the fake, manufactured type. Everything else was under-developed or cryptic at best. No plot what-so-ever. I am most sad that I wasted the two hours watching this junk including having to say it stank to the rest of the world.",negative
The Blackcoat's Daughter,"I just finished watching THE BLACKCOATS DAUGHTER.First, I had no idea what this film was about and didn't read any reviews or watch any trailers. It is rare that I see a movie without knowing anything about it. I recommend not looking into what this movie is about before watching. It will be a pleasantly horrific surprise. The cinematography and score give it an incredibly David Lynch mood similar to Twin Peaks and very much film noir, and oh so unsettling. The long camera stills on character's faces creates an uncomfortable tension and an awkward closeness to what is happening in the film. I felt like I was feeling what the characters were feeling and it was really scary. I have to mention the score alone was incredibly eerie which set the mood magnificently for this film. I felt the score was so well-matched to what was happening in the film, almost to the same degree as score of The Shining. In fact, the build up in this film reminded me of a lot of The Shining.I like that every viewer can have a completely different experience because the story line is a bit vague. Not to the point where you have no idea what is going on, rather you are eagerly grasping every hint thrown your way. I felt like I wanted to figure the plot out before it was ultimately revealed and I kept trying but I didn't manage to which was refreshing, especially because it wasn't a huge plot twist with a crazy 180 degree unexpected turn. It made sense afterwards and I was completely satisfied. This is a slow burn with a build-up of dread that quite literally gave me anxiety. I think the pacing of this film might turn off some viewers as there aren't many jump scares. It is so incredibly dark and ominous. If I had seen this a couple weeks ago it would have made it into top slot for sure. This movie psychologically scared (and probably scarred) me and I have a feeling it will stick with me for quite some time. I am still like, ""what did I just watch?"" And of course I watched it when I was home aloneI think the negative reviews are by people who expected a lame horror movie with jump scares where everything is spelled out for you and you don't need to think much while watching.If you liked movies like ""It Follows"", ""The Witch"", and ""Absentia"" then you'll probably love this.",positive
The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),"I was genuinely expecting more of the same. A horrific and disturbing body modification style horror but I actually found myself becoming bored with the incessant and insipid screaming of Dieter Laser and the profoundly bad acting of Laurence Harvey.The First two movies were polemical and somewhat uncomfortable to watch. They were disturbing and, in many ways, were unique.This final installment was just annoying to watch. It did not shock and the actual, 'centipede' part didn't even happen until very late in the movie.This movie was a massive let down and the radical departure from the stylistic form of the first two movies ruined it in my eyes.Let us hope this really is the last sequence.",negative
The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),"Alright, there's no denying how the concept of seeing spoiled, ditsy assholes, bullies, and violent criminals get tortured by being forced to eat each other's crap can be somewhat gratifying, but watching an adult lose touch with reality and rage like an infant for 90 minutes is hardly fun. I know some fans of the Will Ferrell comedy cult would disagree on that last point, and if this is you then I can only say: Just keep on smoking your dope, drink your Jaegermeister, and don't ever leave your mother's house! Unlike the first sequel, which had superb acting talent, this one failed completely on that point with all characters excepting those who played the convicts (victims). Not even creepy Dieter Laser could follow up the mad-scientist acting skill which he displayed in the original to this series, he just isn't suited for the Texas Prison Warden role, and it was painful to watch him fall down on that.As for reality, and the claims which Tom Six makes to how any of these turds reflect this, ""The Final (Insult)"" takes itself much too seriously on it's medical and political ideas, and anybody who thinks otherwise needs to be locked up before they try anything so stupid. I'm no physician, nor have I any sort of medical training, but then I don't have to be in order to disprove the accuracy of Tom Six's medical claims. Considering that the Millenials grew up with all of the world's information available to them at the click of a few buttons, to see that generation making and accepting such ideas as true is the true horror which this movie causes.Well, kids, it's not actually true that human life ca be sustained by eating feces. I would have thought that everyone down to 10 years old would know through osmosis and even TV that urine is indeed sterile, while poop is heavily laden with bacteria which will kill you if ingested. The bacteria exist safely and usefully within your colon, but if your colon leaks or you eat poop, you will become infected and you will die! Which is something to consider if you ever find yourself tempted to join that ass-rimming cult of sexual stimulation (make sure there isn't any fecal matter present).You may have seen your dog eating his own poop when he's hungry, but this is normal for dogs and some other animals with short intestinal tracts. On account of the shortness, their digestion is much less efficient for them than it is for humans and other primates. Therefore, there is enough food value remaining in their feces that it makes sense for them to re-digest it when they cannot get better food, or somebody forgets to feed them. A dog can do this safely because it is descended from wolf stock, which has been evolving antibodies against bacteria and other pathogens for millions of years longer than primates have, and in much harsher climates. Humans have such efficient digestive systems that even if it weren't for the deadly bacterial hazard there is less nutrition in our poop than is worth the energy to digest it. Therefore, if you were put in a human centipede and you were the second in line behind the one who gets fed any sort of edible food, there's no chance that you would survive, and the last few people in a line of 500 would not even taste any s***, they would begin starving immediately.Don't ask me how I know the above, just go look it up for yourself. I'm not saying believe anything you see that's posted on the subject, far from it - make sure, before you believe anything, that it's agreed upon by multiple, and qualified sources who present their facts in a level-headed manner without any hype, ad-hoc nonsense arguments or other manipulative tactics.As for how this warden's lunatic idea won even a Texas governor's approval...I know there are some who would smile at that idea, but they could not expect that their voters, so many who have imprisoned family members, would not destroy their political careers.",positive
The Void,Spoilers ahead. None of the plots are ever explained. Why was the first couple in the farm house being hunted by the 2 men? Why couldn't one of those men talk? He was silent the entire film and it never said why. They set the girl on fire? What did she ever do? The guy said he went there just to do some drugs so that made no sense. Why was the cop car moved away from the hospital by an extra 100 feet? He still had the keys on him. The cop chopped up his wife with an ax then it shows him in his same cop uniform while she changed clothes holding his hand in the end. Never shown what happened to the Doctor once he entered the void. Why did anyone else need to go into the basement besides the cop looking for his wife? The Asian girl who stayed up top was the only smart one.,negative
The Void,"I saw this movie at the Festival du film Fantastique (Gerardmer, France). We were watching 6 movies per day for 3 days in a row, ""The Void"" was the last movie we were going to see for the day and I had absolutely no idea what it was about. In fact I thought it was a sci-fi movie when we stepped into the theater, and boy am I glad we did not know more ; we were in for quite a ride.If you plan on watching the movie, I strongly advise you to stop reading/watching any type of review, teaser, trailer or any form of info about it. Not that I am going to spoil anything here, but I believe this movie is enjoyed much better if you know absolutely nothing about it. If you've seen the poster you already know too much. OK you might be wondering ""What if I don't like the genre ? I want to know what this is about !"". It's true that this movie is not for everyone, and I can understand that some people will strongly dislike it. Well, just know that if you appreciate the kind of movies John Carpenter was delivering in the 80's, this is for you. Now go !Personnaly, I absolutely loved The Void, it has been a very long time since I felt so much tension while watching a film. The buildup is very well done. This is no ""jump in your seat"" crap. It is the kind of movie that makes you hold your breath and make your blood pressure go up, the kind that makes you feel like you are in a nightmare. The Void will get the same kind of cult status as movies like Event Horizon or In the Mouth of Madness did.",positive
The Hole in the Ground,The only thing that was building up to be scary was when she peeked through her son's bedroom keyhole to see he had grabbed the crawling spider and he rushed back to his bed to eat the spider. The hole in the ground never got explained at all so it was like wtf is the point of it? I did not understand the ending at all. She ended up going to the hole that she thought her son went to...got sucked in the hole and then she saw herself after she rescued her real son that was inside the hole. Well what happened when she saw the other alien like figure that turned into her? She grabbed her and then it cut to another screen. The last 10 minutes of the movie was confusing. It seems like it could have been good but there were a lot of loose ends that did not make sense. I wanted to like it but it ended on a flat note for me.,negative
The Hole in the Ground,"I never leave reviews rarely, but I thought this movie deserved a great review. I am a huge fan of horror movies, and lately it's hard to find a good one. I'm not one for horror movies with blood and guts and endless, pointless killing. I love psychological horror movies, like this one! If 2019 continues to release movies like this one , it's going to be a stellar year for the horror genre :)",positive
Incident in a Ghostland,"To keep this as short as it needs to be...Avoid. Terrible film, no story, just nonsense.One of the worst examples I've seen of alleged jump scares and loud noises intended to shock and scare. Nothing happens, makes no sense. Absolutely terrible film.",negative
Incident in a Ghostland,I don't get the bad reviews. This movie is great in many ways. Outstanding cast. Absolutley great story. It plays with the human mind and how we create different realitys to ease the pain. The Photography is well done. The spiral of happenings around the characters is well thought out. It focuses completley on the two girls. It is a waste of time to compare the movie with the masterpiece martyrs. Ghostland is ghostland. Martyrs is Martyrs.,positive
Spring,"Have you ever seen a movie that is at the same time romantic drama, comedy, sci-fi and a horror movie with some historical elements? Spring is not a drama with other genre *elements*. This movie is at the same time all of the above. Now that's a crazy combination! Spring takes things slowly. It is not fast paced horror movie primarily focused on delivering terror and creeps. Scary scenes are nicely distributed through the whole movie. In between them we enjoy romantic moments. Historical elements play a really important role in delivering the last few key moments. I found this movie pretty funny. Comedy is not by itself obvious (even though the main premise is pretty hilarious when you think about it); those having a peculiar sense of humor will surely appreciate ""hidden"" humor. Just look at a few quotes on IMDb page.When I first had seen the movie I gave it a six. Now I give it an eight. This is one of the most original screen pieces I've ever seen. Different genres are balanced very finely.Spring is going to disturb you, make you laugh and most importantly make you think about what gives life a meaning. Is it really important how long one lives? And the final scene? It gives meaning to the whole movie and provokes answers to existential questions. Just wait till you see it!",negative
Spring,"A hidden gem and easily one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The acting, writing and directing are all seamless.I admit there were moments, such as when our poor protagonist reacts to the truth about his girlfriend, which stretched the bounds of plausibility, but aside from those few scenes the film was incredibly real and fresh throughout.The film's brand of dry, intelligent humor was a lovely surprise. I buckled in for a thriller and found myself laughing many times instead. I also highly commend the snippets of philosophy, morality, mortality, religion and science which were sprinkled throughout the film and delivered with just the right amount of wit and depth by both actors. It really is a wonderful blend of romance and sci-fi, and this is coming from someone who loves sci-fi and has a pathological fear of chick flicks. I highly recommend it.",positive
Backcountry,"When I first read the little blurb about this movie I thought, how refreshing. Man returning to the forest and getting eaten by the woodland critters. It gives you that same tingly sensation you feel when they reintroduce bison or wolves into their natural habitat. Ahhh. This is how it should be. Unfortunately I my state of bliss was rudely interrupted in the opening scene with one of the most annoying sing-along I've ever heard. At this point you keep watching out of pure voyeuristic sadism. You want to see obnoxious jerk get eaten by something. Preferably lots of little or lots of big somethings with large dark eyes that stare blankly into his soul as they nibble on his skin tissue and meaty fat. Little did I know the people who made this film HATE YOU. And me, apparently.And they do hate you (and me). Like all good films, obvious little cues are littered throughout earlier scenes to set the pace. Even better films will exploit those cues in unexpected and creative ways to keep things fun. This film uses them to drive a screw driver through your stomach. You will jump between periods of simultaneous schizophrenic rage and hysterical dread. Warn the neighbors appropriately.The climatic scenes played out in horrific glory....not for the content but because of the incredible, mind bending stupidity you are forced to sit through and endure. You will be cursing at them like grandma during a Wheel of Fortune repeat, unconsciously gripping your sides in pain as your body goes into spasms to induce you to turn away and cease subjecting yourself to cinematic wreck unfolding in front of you.By the end of this film there was blood and vomit everywhere. Thats not a spoiler folks!",negative
Backcountry,"Girlfriend gets let down by boyfriend, when his fantasy trip to his childhood dream of the wilderness attracts a deadly menace.Really well shot and edited, lots of talent. The actors are good, and good looking, and the music is well judged.The weakness is in the writing. The characters are established in a lovely opening scene as they travel in their car while singing a daft hillbilly song, but after that the story is a bit thin. Another character is introduced to upset the mood (dodgy and unnecessary Irish accent), but it doesn't really tie in.The bear effects are not up to the standard of The Edge (1997), and for genuine bear-sturbingness this comes nowhere near Grizzly Man (2005).Overall, well-delivered but weak story.",positive
Wounds,"I thought with this cast, this would be a great horror movie. Instead it's a literally wound to your life and time.The storyline is so jumbled and a mess, not even Armie can save it. We honestly have no clue about the plot except there was some kind of ritual.There was no explanation of why Rick was the portal for whatever came out of him at the end; we could barely see it because of the stupid CGI cockroaches covering the screen at the end.No explanation why Armie's character was chose and no reason why Carrie was the only one affected by the internet tunnel of hell..I suppose?And finally, what was the purpose of the college kids? To drop the phone and send messages with ZERO context?When you do realize that the ritual was performed based on some books, you are never told what happened and why it happened.This movie is garbage.",negative
Wounds,"As a die hard fan of Lynch's craft to pour filth on the mundane and twist it and a fan of more underground grime like the Flowers trilogy that revolve more around exploration of a twisted, grimy setting than a by the book tale, I adored this movie.
It's slow, creeping and festering piece with disorienting images strewn in between that pulled me in tighter while making me delightfully queasy. The acting is strong and so is Anvari's skilled steady hand for framing scenes and visceral imagery. It probably belongs more in the terror and surreal categories than standard horror.
My main gripe is probably Armie Hammer's natural charm and the script not really emphasising Will's supposed staleness and hollowness, you often kinda feel yourself rooting for a rather average and flawed guy and his descent feels a bit like the generic sudden descent into madness trope and not like Will's lack of drive and standards being the vessel for the rotten fruit he will harvest.On a side note, it's also fun to imagine this movie as sort of a side sequel portraying the aftermath of one of the countless ""college kids mess with forces they don't understand"" movies.",positive
31,"As juvenile as calling a grown man ""Zombie"" this is yet another awkward embarrassing adolescent amateurish annoying movie from this clueless guy. His wife at the center of it, yet again making ""deranged"" expressions trying to be as sleazy as possible but with the zero talent of a non-actress,doesn't help it either. Nope, this man can't get it right even by mere chance. He's still all pose. Like a tribute band of 70's/80's horror movies who get the look (kind of) but can't play worth a crap. By the time a terrible little man actor dressed as a Nazi/clown listens to real Hitler speech records was time to turn this garbage of. You see even the vague feeling that this drivel was in this way connected to such a terrible event in history was so sad and stupid i had to quit. Because this exactly what a Rob Zombie movie is , a dwarf actor dresses as a Nazi made up as a clown to be shocking and bizarre just for the sake of shocking and bizarre, and the results are of course pathetic. Oh boy, somewhere there's talented people who can't find money to produce their movie and this hack has already made 7 or something like that. Pisses me off.",negative
31,"OK so every fan of House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects begged for another film like those. We begged and we begged, we said do a prequel, do an origin story, just give us more of this type of movie. And RZ delayed it, he gave us Halloween reboots, he took a risk and gave us the witch horror version of a Clockwork Orange in Lords of Salem, he even gave us an adult Scooby-do with El SuperBeasto, he took to TV and direct an episode of CSI, literally he gave us a look at other works, but we kept begging for another 1000. And understandably so, those 2 films can be argued that they changed horror films, the villains were glorified and loved. Sheri Moon's acting of Baby was so awesome, 9 out of 10 men would still pick Baby up knowing she was taking them to the house of 1000, the one that wouldn't, well he doesn't like women, Otis was off the chain, totally insane and Capt Spaulding will forever be an icon and should be listed as one of the greatest horror villain in history.So when I see people complaining that 31 doesn't give us anything new, I'm kind of frustrated, we asked, no begged for this film. I agree it is nothing ground breaking, but RZ already broke the ground originally here. I look at this film more as a favor to the fans. RZ continues to want to direct and write new, different films, but we keep begging for more. So much in fact we helped fund raise for this film, expecting exactly what it was.Is the film perfect, hell no, it's completely imperfect. It is pure evil, as was House and Devil's.This is exactly what fans of those movies wanted. A fact paced, blood hammering, film that give us new villains to love.It is perfectly imperfect.Now, consider my taste for the past movies filled, as I personally am ready to move on and see the next chapter of creativity from RZ.",positive
Dark Skies,"Scott Stewart's work is really lacking in execution to me. Legion and Priest were both really nice concepts but they were not brought to life in a way that captured or kept my attention, or rather, just as Dark Skies, they left much to be desired. In this film, we avoid the dreadful build-up and anxiety, and we jump straight into the oddities, which is a great thing as most of the screen time in other sci-fi films is taken up be long-winded scientific explanations that turn out to be false. Another good thing is that this film isn't about some made-up conspiracy that's hard to swallow, no, it's a documented experience many Americans have had, and something the US Government is had has been heavily involved in...so there's a great reality factor there. But, this film is lacking something, just as all his work is lacking in some area. The acting is solid, the story is okay, but something is missing.Perhaps it's the patchwork revelation of ""the signs were right in front of you,"" and ""you should've known all along."" Or maybe its the fact that he employed a series of mini-flashbacks to explain the ending...which leads one to believe that his plot development was off a little. I think what was really missing was any real conflict. Yeah, that's it. There was no solid, actual conflict. The encounters, the actual climax, none of that presented any real tension or suspense or just plain old conflict. I liked this movie and I don't think I wasted my time by watching it. Nope. I enjoyed it. I just wouldn't watch it often.",negative
Dark Skies,"Can a science fiction film be given the horror treatment? This isn't something new, like The Fourth Kind, but unlike that film, this one is truly terrifying, especially when you least expect it to be. Granted its credits never fail to remind you that the producers here were also behind Paranormal Activity and Insidious, but look hard for that ghoul set to spook, and you'll never find it. Instead it deals with alien abduction, and boy, has it never been delivered this good, and scary.Written and directed by Scott Stewart, this is a definite improvement from his earlier efforts with Legion and Priest. Dark Skies lulls you into some complacency, introducing the audience to the Barrett family, who may seem like the typical all American one living in the suburbs, where dad Daniel (Josh Hamilton) is in between jobs, and mom Lacy (Keri Russell) supports the household for the time being as a realtor to keep the mounting bills at bay. Sons Jesse (Dakota Goyo) and Sam (Kadan Rockett) are the typical teenager and toddler growing up, with a little bit more focus on the former as he hangs out with relative geek company, and is on his first romantic brush with the daughter of his mom's best friend.Then things start to go all strange, and at times begin to feel like Paranormal Activity in treatment for just a bit. Lacy finds herself inexplicably waking up in the middle of the night to encounter things like having her fridge raided by someone unknown, or seeing her kitchen wares and containers stacked in a geometric pattern. These are the more benign encounters, until flocks of migrating birds start to violently converge at their house, and each family member start to behave as if possessed, losing track of time, and being subconsciously unaware during their awake hours. Worse, they also seem to bear the marks of physical harm, and it's not long after that CCTV cameras got placed around the house.But no, we're not given any found footage treatment or first person perspective, because that would be pushing the envelope of familiarity. Instead, Dark Skies relies on good old fashioned storytelling, with a fair bit of conventional devices, techniques and styles to amplify key moments in the narrative that will make you cringe at your seat, or be tightly grabbing onto that armrest when Stewart deftly builds suspense. The horror imagery got strongly built into carefully crafted scenes, which made this many times more effective than the average horror film that had blood, gore and makeup as part of its arsenal, something conspicuously absent in Dark Skies, but demonstrating that it could do a lot more with less.The narrative was kept simple enough to revolve only around a handful of characters, and firmly around the family that allows it to be easily identifiable under a What If scenario, while building one's affiliation with them as they seem nice enough not to be suffering under such inexplicable terms. But what worked wonders here are the technical aspects, from its steady cinematography which is minus all the trappings of badly formed habits that would have made this a blur to follow, and solid editing that instills fear especially when transitioning between lost time. What stood out will be the brilliant sound design of course, adding that layer to bring that shiver down your spine. Watching this with the volume turned off would have neutered the film, and that's testament to how important, and effective this aspect was to the movie.The finale is set to ruff a few feathers, although it may be a stretch to suggest that there would be doors left open for a follow up film. The cast delivered top performances, augmented by technical competency to make this the perfect blend of science fiction with horror sensibilities that puts many contemporary horror films of late to shame. A definite recommendation if you're looking for that heart-thumping thrill ride that's lacking in recent times for the genre fans.",positive
Freaks of Nature,"Some movies have so many talented people working on them that a Movie Fan can't help but take notice. Take the horror-comedy ""Freaks of Nature"" (R, 1:32) for example. For starters, its screenplay was written by Oren Uziel who wrote ""22 Jump Street"", a rare sequel that was as good as the original, if not better. Then there's the cast: Denis Leary has voiced characters in ""A Bug's Life"" and the ""Ice Age"" movies, been a supporting player in the 2012 and 2014 ""Spider-Man"" films and starred in the TV series ""Rescue Me"" on FX. Joan Cusack has a similar resume, which she has been building since 1980. Ed Westwick starred on TV's ""Gossip Girl"" and ""Wicked City"" and played roles in movies such as ""Children of Men"" and ""Romeo & Juliet"". Vanessa Hudgens was a Disney kid in the ""High School Musical"" trilogy and then graduated to more adult roles in ""Spring Breakers"" and ""Machete Kills"". Bob Odenkirk is a comedian who made a name for himself as the morally ambiguous lawyer in ""Breaking Bad"" and ""Better Call Saul"". Keegan-Michael Key is known mainly for his comedic work on TV, but began appearing in multiple movies per year starting in 2010. Mae Whitman well, you get the point. And in this movie, the relative unknowns at least look like movie stars. Nicholas Braun resembles a young Jim Caviezel, Mackenzie Davis made me imagine a taller Zooey Deschanel and Josh Fadem calls to mind one of the Coreys from the 80s (although I still can't tell my Feldman from my Haim). You would think those kind of looks and that kind of talent and experience would practically guarantee a good movie. You would think.""Freaks of Nature"" takes place in the fictional town of Dillford, Ohio (""The Home of the Riblet""), where humans, vampires and zombies live in relative harmony. Key plays a high school teacher who, as a vampire, has been at the school for 97 years, and he's sick of it – every bit of it. Westwick also plays a vampire, but one who (type-casting alert) uses people for his own selfish goals! Whitman's character plays a zombie who makes zombie life look and sound more pleasant than you'd expect. Leary is a self-made (human) man who started the riblet plant which put the town on the map – and he never lets anyone forget it! Hudgens' character smokes marijuana (a lot) and uses a classmate's house as a place to hide her stash. Cusack and Odenkirk (also human) are the hippie parents of Braun's character, Dag Parker. Two of Dag's classmates, the pretty but insecure Petra (Mackenzie) and the brainy outcast Ned (Fadem) decide to become a vampire and a zombie, respectively, which means that Dag is now friends with a girl who wants to drink his blood and a guy who wants to eat his brains. Well, maybe ""friends"" isn't the best word to describe their relationship. In this small town, these three have known each other their whole lives, but aren't as close as they might have been as kids. Circumstances force all three to get reacquainted, but fast. Their lives, and possibly the lives of everyone in their town depend on it.The uneasy peace amongst the mortals and the undead is shattered by an alien apocalypse. You might think that the town's three main groups would band together in the face of a common enemy, but this alien invasion (which results in a force field being created around their town) just brings up long-held prejudices and suspicions, leading the vampires, humans and zombies to start fighting and killing each other. Dag, Petra and Ned find themselves in a situation that provides them temporary safety, which allows them to calm down and become level-headed enough to devise a plan to save their small town.""Freaks of Nature"" has a premise which sounds fun, but fails to deliver on that promise. Too many of the characters are unlikeable and the jokes aren't nearly as funny as in the similarly-themed ""Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"" (which, by the way, manages to be far more entertaining with far fewer well-known actors). This movie's problem isn't just that the actors and the script are uninspired, but the set-up of the story and some of its developments just don't make any sense, comedically or otherwise. For example, the zombie teens attend high school even though they lack any real language skills or intellectual abilities, the vampire teens also manage to go to school even though it's during the day (in the sunlight? hello!) and the humans (both the fictional characters and the actual filmmakers) look to be making up the rules to this brave new world as they go, with plot points that seem to come out of nowhere. This movie looks and sounds like it wants to be a modern version of a 1980s-style B-movie, but that's too lofty a goal for this underachiever. Some viewers may enjoy the film's aimless quirkiness, but that would take more effort than this movie deserves, in spite of its accomplished cast. ""D+""",negative

Blair Witch,"James Donahue finds a recently-uploaded video, containing an image which he believes to be his sister Heather who disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while investigating the legend of the Blair Witch. Believing she is still alive, James makes plans to head into the woods, accompanied by friends Peter Jones, Ashley Bennett, and film student Lisa Arlington, who wants to make her own documentary based on James' search. Local residents Talia and Lane, who uploaded the footage from a video tape they found in the woods, join them on their search.Upon entering the woods, Ashley cuts her foot while the group is crossing a shallow creek. Setting up camp for the night, Lane and Talia discuss the disappearance of Heather's film crew, as well as other mysterious occurrences in the region, all of which they ascribe to the Blair Witch. After hearing noises in the woods during the night, and after inexplicably oversleeping until 2.00pm, they find strange stick figures twined together hanging from the trees surrounding their camp. Unnerved, the four friends elect to head home, despite Lane and Talia's reluctance. Lisa notices a roll of twine in Lane's backpack and accuses him of crafting the stick figures as a prank. Lane and Talia are kicked out of the group, after admitting to the ruse. After several hours' walking, the four arrive back at their original campsite, their GPS information proving to be inaccurate. Lisa sends up a drone to obtain an aerial fix of their location, but it malfunctions and crashes into the trees. Ashley develops a fever and becomes bedridden. The team is forced to camp again as night falls and Peter goes to gather firewood. After hearing strange sounds, he is chased by an unseen force which causes a tree to collapse, gravely wounding him. James, hearing Peter's cries, searches for him but only finds his flashlight by the collapsed tree.During the night, James and Lisa hear more sounds outside their tent. Moments later, Lane and Talia emerge looking haggard, claiming they have been wandering in the woods for five or more days without a single sunrise. Believing that he is hallucinating, Lane runs off while Talia begs for food and then sits by the fire and stares blankly. The following morning, James and Lisa are stunned to find that the sun indeed has not risen. Emerging from their tents, they discover many stick figures, much larger than those crafted by Lane, surrounding their camp. Talia recognizes clumps of her own hair tied to one of the stick figures. Ashley awakens and, devastated by the news of Peter's disappearance, blames Talia for their plight, spitefully snapping her stick figure in half. Talia then crumples to the ground, her body grossly mangled, twisted and broken, before an invisible presence attacks and causes them to flee in blind panic. Ashley gets separated and removes a strange object out of her leg, inexplicably embedded in her wound. She falls to her death trying to recover the drone, stuck high in a nearby tree. The camera shows her body being dragged out of the frame by an unseen force.A rainstorm envelops the woods as Lisa and James stumble outside a house which matches the one seen in Lane's video. James looks up and believes he spots his sister in an upstairs window. Despite Lisa's pleas, he enters the house and becomes trapped in an upstairs room. Lisa is terrified by the brief sight of an emaciated entity and runs inside, ending up in the basement. She finds a crazed and now heavily-bearded Lane, who traps her in an underground tunnel. Lisa forces herself through the narrow and muddy crawlspace and emerges back in the basement and stabs Lane in self-defense. Chased by the entity she glimpsed outside, Lisa runs upstairs, seeing the same reflection in the mirror that James thought was his sister. She reunites with James and they flee to the attic and lock the door behind them. A bright white light passes through the cracks and windows of the attic before the door is forced open. James tells Lisa to face the corner of the room. He desperately apologizes to Lisa for their fate before the Blair Witch causes him to think that his sister is speaking to him. James turns around and dies. Lisa uses Lane's camcorder to indirectly view what is behind her and begins walking backwards in the hope she can escape. She hears the witch imitate James' words of apology again and, believing him to be alive, turns around before being attacked off-screen. The camera abruptly drops to the floor. The screen cuts to black.",positive
Verónica,"Veronica is doing the media circuit at the moment being advertised as one of the scariest movies ever made, causing people to turn it off or walk out of the cinema in fear.Let me clarify it is a publicity stunt.I went in expecting something generic but I sure as hell did not expect something this awful.Spain has a long history of successful horror films, in fact I would consider Rec (2007) the scariest movie ever made. Top that with fantastic zombie cinema from the 60's-80's and they've proven that have what it takes.Sadly Veronica absolutely screams foreign influences, specifically Hollywood. Veronica is overwhelmingly similiar to your modern generic American films such as the Conjuring. It has all the usual tropes but somehow manages to feel offensively recycled and considerably worse.There is no originality to be found here, from the plot to the attempted scares it's all so terrible. So the bottom line, is it scary? Well no, in fact hell no. Very little actually happens and when it does the timing is off so badly all effect is lost. As much as I hate the likes of the Insidious and Conjuring movies they at least manage to get a jump scare or two in! This doesn't even manage that.Veronica is the absolute pits, I'd advise anyone even the most hardcore of horror fan to consider giving this a pass.The Good:Couple of well constructed scenesLead did a decent enough jobThe Bad:Predictible ""Twist"" Unashamedly boringNo originality whatsoeverThings I Learnt From This Movie:I'm left curious if the advert during the casting for the movie actually specified ""Must have enormous mouth""",negative
Verónica,"Yes, its not original and try to be this fancy annabele-astral-thingy, but THIS film have STYLE. And its much than Curse or what name this boring shlok in 70th setting. ""Veronica"" - did this much better, because... well I think witch-house-ish OST and early 90th - its top notch. Its good time for this, and this film clearly go to the one pantheon with It Follows and others modern GOOD horrors.",positive
I Spit on Your Grave 2,"The 1978 movie will go down as one of the most controversial movies in history. It was horrific and brutal and broke boundaries. It might have been a horribly brutal film, but it put something on screen we'd never seen before and without it, movies like The Accused and Girl With A Dragon Tattoo couldn't exist like they do. The 2010 remake showed how far we've come as a society. A movie that was once relegated to obscure theaters and banned outright in several countries is now a mainstream Hollywood release filmed in high definition and sent worldwide. It wasn't as gripping as the original, but it should be stunning how far we've come that a movie once regarded as 'the most horrific of all time' could now get released in every cinema on the planet.This movie shows sometimes you really need to think before you sequel. Why exactly did I Spit On Your Grave need a sequel? It didn't, and let's be honest this isn't a sequel. There's no returning characters, no recurring villains, the only thing about this that matches the original or the remake is that it's about a girl who get's brutally raped and kills her attackers. That's not a sequel, that's a retelling. It's barely even a good retelling because for starters this movie tries to make one of the attackers (Specifically the first guy that rapes her, and breaks into her apartment aka THE REASON EVERYTHING HAPPENS) sympathetic. That makes no sense. I'm sorry but if you start the ritualistic group rape of a woman, you could be working at a hospital for deaf orphans with polio and I'm not going to sympathize you. I'm going to hate you and want you to suffer the most.The main girl is just I can't even. Her plot goes that she want's to be a model, finds a 'free modeling' poster and then get's put into this hell. Her screaming is annoying as hell and I know that she's going through hell, I know she's going to scream but guess what? There's a way to scream that doesn't make me hate you, but her screaming instantly sets me off (Maybe it's because after a while her character trait is 'Scream')The main 'villain', aka the first guy to rape and break into her house, has the most obscenely inconsistent character ever. I mean before he breaks into the house he just seems jerky, then he's rapey and killy, and then he's sad and trying to help did they just realize the script have too many characters and combine 2 of them in the rewriting of this? Because that might make sense it'd be dumb but I'd understand it. Also when the girl finally escapes, covered in wounds and screaming 'help me' no one listens. I'm sorry, even in Yugoslavia or wherever the hell they took her, someone would help her hell the police don't even help her, someone from a shelter takes her. I mean maybe it's cos I've never been in this country (I don't even know which one they're in), maybe it's a policy that shelters can over ride Policemen but I'm sorry, this makes absolutely no sense. Oh and it makes even less sense when (Surprise) The people that save her end up taking her back to the rape room so yes, this movie just want's you to believe that everyone is going to rape you and there's nothing you can do about it. I have seen Irreversible, Last House, The ORIGINAL I Spit On your Grave and The Accused and all of them are far better films with a rape as a major plot line in them than this. This isn't even cheap looking enough to be exploitation, this is cruel in the worst way When you make a horror movie you're meant to make it horrific, I have absolutely no problems with a horror movie that uses rape as a plot device, provided it uses it well or does something to change the medium. Instead of something like that, we get a film where a man rapes a woman with a tazer to the point where she's bleeding this isn't horror, this is anti-woman film making at it's worst, it's no wonder this film went straight to DVD, it feels like it's too good for even that.",negative
I Spit on Your Grave 2,"I saw the remake of ""I Spit on your grave"" and although some scenes were pretty tough to watch, overall it was a pretty good revenge film.When I saw ""I Spit on your grave 2"" was out, I thought I would give it a go. I was surprised... the movie kept me gripped, intrigued and yes, although one or two scenes were pretty harrowing, I didn't feel they went on for as long as the original and remake.If you liked the first one, in theory, you should like this one. Similar revenge focus with a couple of twists, decent acting and a pretty good story line. Not for the faint hearted but defiantly worth a watch in my opinion if you like your horrors / revenge movies.",positive
Unfriended,"Guys, here's a tip if you want to see this movie. Instead of shilling out actual money, just get 4 people you know with Skype accounts, get in a group call, and then just scream for 2 hours straight. You know have the entire plot, line of events, and premise of Unfriended. Just another painful to watch, stupid found footage horror that decided to go from a normal camera to the most boring and ugly way of showing it, Skype chat, because why would you want the camera to be enjoyable? Skip the movie, just go watch a PewDiePie video, it's the exact same amount of obnoxious screaming, but you can also watch a video game instead of focusing on the screaming idiot.",negative
Unfriended,"I was hyped for this movie from the moment I saw the trailer, despite the overwhelmingly negative reaction that trailer got (people saying it looked stupid and gimmicky while complaining about the lack of creativity in modern horror movies... oh the irony). Tonight, I got the chance to watch it and I'm glad to say it didn't disappoint. I got exactly what I expected to get: a tense, well-acted, unique, and perfectly crafted thriller with an insanely high amount of suspenseful entertainment packed into its short run time. Without a doubt, Unfriended is one of the best thrillers to come out in the past few years.Despite what people might be saying, this isn't a found footage horror movie. This isn't 80 minutes of a bunch of bozos shaking a hand-held camera while loud, cheap jumpscare noises play to startle the audience. This is 80 minutes of tense, realistically handled supernatural ""horror""(I put that in quotes cause the movie isn't actually as scary as it is tense, suspenseful, and stressful) with characters who actually behave like real teenagers would instead of the generic cardboard cutouts we get in most modern horror movies. Yes, the characters aren't particularly likable (with the exception of main character, Blair), but that's not the point. The point is that, for once, we get characters who actually behave like human beings and don't make stupid decisions just to lead the audience into another cheap jumpscare. Granted, there are a few jumpscares here, but they're not the focus. The focus is the relationship between these characters, the way the killer drives them apart by revealing secrets, and the increasing tension as more and more people die.Unfriended kept me glued to the screen for the entirety of its short run time. Not once was I bored, not once did I feel the movie was going nowhere. The tension escalates and escalates until the breaking point finale, and by then you're already on the edge of your seat. Check this one out and ignore all the negative comments. Most of them are either from people who expected the movie to be absolutely terrifying, people who despise gimmicks in movies (no matter how well they're executed), or people who simply aren't interested in the idea of a movie being told through a computer screen, facebook messages, and primarily skype chats (people who have zero interest in modern computers and social media). Even if you're not a computer freak, Unfriended will probably hook you as it did me. Give it a chance. It deserves it just for being brave and ambitious enough to try out something entirely new.",positive
Scary Movie V,"I will start off by saying I LOVE the Scary Movie franchise, especially scary movie 3. My girlfriend and I went to see it on the 12th, we were so excited because we both love the previous films. 5 to 10 minutes into it, neither of us were laughing, just straight face. I whispered over to her and told her this is really stupid, she agreed. None of other people that were sitting in the room laugh either. I can't believe we actually sat through the whole movie until the end, since we paid for it already. It had like 3 moments that made us chuckle a bit, but that was it. If I could demand my money back, I would. Little note for the producers- Instead of paying huge amounts of money to the celebrities, how about spend some in developing the story and jokes? I would say this movie *might* make little 10 years old children laugh, but that's about it.It was so bad that I decided to make an IMDb account to criticize.",negative
Scary Movie V,"Honestly I don't have much to say about it, other than it was horrible in all the senses, I thought the 4th was the last one, and it should had stay like that, cause now this one adds to the list as the worst of the whole scary movie collection. It was so kiddy in some stuff and overly done I honestly don't know what they were thinking or even if they were thinking when they did this movie, just awful. I liked more a haunted house and that is a lot to say cause it wasn't that good either but at least it made me laugh a few times, well maybe the only thing i like more than the haunted house is that they didn't go showing butts around or sexual actions every 5 seconds, I am not saying they don't, but is less than the others. I still don't recommend anyone to see it, not even in red box wait it to be on TV :)",positive
Slender Man,This movie was horrible . Longest hr & half of my life. It kept dragging and relied on not so scary jump scares.

Lords of Chaos,"We all know the story, and now it was put on film. It made Oystein a very likable if not fake persona, the film is brutally honest about how Varg thought Euronymous was fake and only wanted attention, while in the same breath Varg went to the media seeking the attention. The casting for Varg was questionable at first but I thought Cohen brought a good perspective on the narcissism of Varg after watching it twice now. It made all of this seem very possible and realistic which was admirable on Jonas's part. Everyone was called out, no one was spared. The violence is gruesome and the most realistic I've seen in a while. It was funny, violent and had a sex scene, it's got alot of layers to it that BM fans would consider ""gay"" and pointless, but then again as the director says ""If black metal fans are against everything why would they be for this film?"" Touche.",negative

Insidious: The Last Key,"What story there was was dreadfully slow and convoluted, and bore little resemblance to the original.Nothing about it was scary at all save for the mild ""suitcase"" jump when we were all expecting the baddie to be behind the case not in it.

Insidious: The Last Key,"Firstly, I would like to say that Elise is such a crucial part of this film and I couldn't have related more with anyone but her. I love her role in this. Always outstanding! The storyline is solid with characters that you can connect with and the scares DO FOLLOW! Best way to start your 2018 off with this spooky and very scary film!",positive
The Purge: Election Year,"This film was god awful. I expected it to be at least a little entertaining but its not. The trailer for the film pretty much spoils the entire movie. The acting is the equivalent to a pornography film and the cinematography is beyond terrible. It's a cliché cash grab that is not worth the money to see in theaters or buy on blue-ray. I even found myself laughing at how bad some of the scenes in this film are, specifically the ending where the whole thing is predictable. Hell even in the second act of the film, they introduce these ""Candy Bar"" girls who not even kidding try to kill a main character for a candy bar. The script is lazy and not engaging in any way. The tension completely drops as you realize the protagonists will always find a convenient way out of a bad situation. Deus ex Machina. Do not see this film unless you want to have a laugh with a couple of friends over how bad it is. It's really not a good movie.",negative
The Purge: Election Year,This movie is similar to anarchy but improves on some stuff to make it better. I like how it shows that the rebels (what i call them because i have no idea what they're called) are becoming more and more like the purge which in the end redeems them to not be like the purge they want to destroy. The pacing can be kinda bad and sometimes its hard to determine if this movie has a main villain or not. I like how the masks are mostly based on actual people which makes it feel more realistic and colorful instead of blank basic masks. The action here is pretty good. I also think it's a bit ridiculous with the huge year gap which is pretty unrealistic with the characters looking the same that it would be better if it left that out as it wouldn't change anything at all.,positive
The Taking of Deborah Logan,"Although it's a lower budget movie the hand filming gives it great authentic feel and allows you to feel as if it could be real. Best use of this type of filming I've seen. The acting is superb and Jill Larson is mesmerizing. Such a nice twist on cookie cutter scare films and tactics. Loved the use of darkness and the realistic comments from actors who reply the way normal (non scripted) people probably would if faced with such fear. When the one technician leaves after having had enough of the craziness, his comments are amusing but, hey, realistic! Also the use of subtitles is great, not only because audio is realistically hard to hear, but it satisfies the viewers need to really understand what is happening. Applause. Well done!",negative
The Taking of Deborah Logan,"The idea of making a horror film based on Alzheimer's is a sort of tasteless one, isn't it? I know a lot of horror is tasteless in some way, but this left me wanting to take a quick shower. The image of an old woman in the student's pseudo-doc who's either dead or close to death early on in the film was unpleasant, but it didn't make me think 'oooh, scary', it just made me think the filmmakers were...let's be kind and say 'enterprising' for sticking that image in there.It's exploitive enough, with a frail elderly woman walking around naked, having painful medical tests run on her (just like Regan MacNeil! Surprise, surprise!) and acting spooky, which is one thing, but then it switches gears to a dead child murderer and snakes and kidnappings, and it should have been cut by about thirty minutes to keep the suspense up.There's an ostensibly happy ending for the old lady and her daughter--well, about as happy as you can get with a story about a possessed Alzheimer's patient, and yes, that does feel very silly to write--but an extremely stupid and out of left field 'evil continues' ending is tacked on for a character we don't care about, since she's in the film for all of five minutes, tops.I found it more effective as a horror film when it was dealing with Deborah as a victim of Alzheimer's and not Deborah as a possessed snake lady. The woman who plays Deborah should get some kind of reward for wasting her time in this, as she turns in a decent performance. Mileage may vary, but I thought this was an absolutely terrible film, and the supernatural second half was boring as boring can be.",positive
Raw,"Raw or Grave (original title) is a French horror film about cannibalism. This is not the first time I'm drawn to French films of this genre, for instance Martyrs and High Tension are only a few I could mention that are definitely worth a watch.Unfortunately Raw doesn't deliver. It tried to be disgusting and I guess it is but shock value doesn't really work if you don't have a decent plot/story-line. During the film it is noticeable it tried to be edgy and over the top but it fails miserably. It's just a bunch of nonsense with an awful soundtrack in the mix. For instance in one scene the sister of the main character (forgot the name) jumps in front of a car, killing the passengers and proceeds to eat them. Luckily no more cars pass by while she was feeding herself and luckily in France the police is nonexistent which explain why she can kill so many people without any suspicion whatsoever.I could go on and on.In conclusion if you like annoying music, young adults trying to be edgy and people biting each other because it's lunch time, then this is for you.",negative
Raw,"'RAW' made me remember why I love movies. I can't wait for you all to feast your eyes and stomachs on first time French director Julia Ducournau's masterpiece in cinema, simply titled 'RAW'. Julia takes an overly done genre trope (cannibalism) and completely makes it fresh, organic, and ready to serve to the masses in a very beautiful, elegant, and most disturbing way in which a young woman is on a coming- of-age quest in her life and discovers her sexual side as well as a new appetite.This film hits on some real primal emotions that I did not think I had in me and had me completely hypnotized from start to finish in this well-paced magnificent movie. The film follows the smart and shy young woman Justine (Garance Marillier) as she enters her very first day of university where everyone is learning to become veterinarian. At her first party, she runs into her older sister Alexia (Ella Rumpf), who is also studying to be a veterinarian and who wants to both look after her younger sister and torment her.The older students certainly haze the incoming freshman, by making them do some grueling tasks, including throwing animal blood over all of them and making them eat raw animal organs. It's a difficult job for Justine to eat the animal organs, since she and her whole family have been vegan for all their lives, but in order to fit in, she is more or less forced to take that first taste of raw meat. Turns out, she loves it. Perhaps too much as she craves more and more of that raw meat.At the same time, Justine is undergoing her sexual awakening, whether it be with her gay male roommate or someone else in the school. The parallels of both her food and sexual appetite are done in the most subtle and gracious ways, and at no time do you ever dislike Justine or her sister Alexia. On the contrary, these characters are so well ""fleshed"" out that you want to be friends with them. As the film plays out, Ducournau (who also wrote the screenplay) keeps delivering surprises at every corner, keeping our minds racing, stomachs rumbling, and story flowing.The relationship between Alexia and Justine is simply fantastic. These two sisters are so real and one of the themes of the film is loyalty and family, which in no matter what obstacle comes your way, you stick together. Mariellier and Rumpf turn in exquisite performances and this being Ducournau's first film – I can't imagine how amazing her second foray into filmmaking will be. The practical effects of gore here are so realistic, that you might second guess yourself as to whether or not anyone was really harmed during the film. That's how good it is. 'RAW' is one of those films that comes around once every ten years and you shouldn't miss it.MUST-SEE!",positive
Unfriended: Dark Web,"Unfriended Dark Web is another cheap found footage horror film trying to squeeze a summer buck because Halloween isn't for horror films anymore. This flaming garbage heap is nothing more than 90 minutes of boring characters being stalked by an implausible group of cyber hackers who literally have nothing better to do, the frequent jump scare usually resulting in the death of one of the characters until they're all dead. Essentially, you can get just as much entertainment from reading a poorly written dark web creepypasta and save yourself the money since this movie is nothing more than a rehash of most of them. The plot bends over backwards to be winding and make the hackers seem like they're always 5 steps ahead of the main characters as well as conveniently all over the place whether they're in the streets or hiding in someone's closet. Also it'd be amazing to find out where these killer hackers found they're copies of live photoshop and sony vegas streaming studio.
The Dark Web in real life is not a place to visit, it's namely used for government communications and sites like the silk road are for secret illegal transactions like drugs and weapons. The concept of evil hackers or high tech murderers is the equivalent of the hook handed killer or Bloody Mary, an urban legend told to scare kids. The dark web isn't full of psychopaths or evil cults looking to kill indiscriminately, and this movie is nothing more than an overlong short horror film that could've been neatly wrapped up in 10 minutes or less, otherwise avoid and don't bother, the director, producers and writers obviously aren't.",negative

The First Purge,"Loved the original Purge movie, but this one was just so horrible. Seriously... the big neighborhood drug dealer is the good guy hero (""Make way for the King!"") and all the white people are bad & evil. I kept hoping I was wrong, but it just kept getting more and more obvious. What's the message here? Just a movie to feed the racial divide with stereotypes all over the place. Incredibly disappointing.",negative
The First Purge,"Worst purge movie ever? Ehh no. Best purge movie ever? Definitely not. I might come off biased since this is the first purge movie I ever saw (only one I saw in theaters as well). Skeletor's acting is over the top and crazy that it makes it fun to watch him. The pacing is extremely fast in this movie and even with it being almost an hour and 40 minutes long, the purge event feels too quick. Just a reminder this movie came out about 4 or 5 months after Black Panther which shows how inspired they are to have black males as the leads and factions like corrupted cops and other hate groups. At least election year being political made sense because election year got rid of the purge. This movie is only political about racism because of the time this movie came out. I wouldn't say its better than Anarchy or Election year but it is WAY better than the original (the one that came out in 2013).",positive
Goosebumps,"The teenager Zach (Dylan Minnette) moves from New York with his widow mother Gale (Amy Ryan) to Madison, Delaware, where she will be the vice- principal of the local high-school. Zach is bored and upset and while bringing his cardboard boxes with his belongings home, he meets his gorgeous next-door neighbor Hannah (Odeya Rush) that welcomes him. But soon her creepy father R.L. Stine (Jack Black) threatens him if he gets close to his daughter again. Zach befriends the clumsy Champ (Ryan Lee) at school and they schedule to go to a party together on Friday. However, Zach meets Hannah again but they are caught by Stine. Zach believes that Stine is an abusive father and he breaks in his house with Champ to seek out Hannah. When Zach opens a book in Stine's library, he accidentally unleashes a monster from the book. Soon he learns that the weird Stine is a famous writer of horror stories that keeps his imaginary friends that are monsters locked up in each book. But Zach released the evil Slappy that promises to bring havoc to Madison opening all the books on the same time.""Goosebumps"" is a silly film that entertains. The plot has funny moments but Champ is an unbearable character and Ryan Lee does not help with his face. ""Aunt"" Lorraine is also annoying, but Amy Ryan performs a nice character. The chemistry between Dylan Minnette and the lovely Odeya Rush, who seems to be a sister of Mila Kunis, are worthwhile watching. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Goosebumps: Monstros e Arrepios"" (""Goosebumps: Monsters and Chills"")",negative
Goosebumps,"""Stephen King is no slouch,"" commented a member of the Movie Fan Facebook Page staff. The man has published 60 books, which have sold over 350 million copies. ""Wait a minute,"" you say. ""Why start a review of a movie based on R.L. Stine's books by talking about Stephen King?"" Fair question. Well, Stine has been called ""the Stephen King of children's literature."" Beyond that, you may be surprised to learn that Stine has bested the famously prolific King by publishing hundreds of books, which have sold over 400 million copies! Think about that. It's enough to give you goose bumps. That, of course, is the name of Stine's most popular series of books, brought to the big screen in the film ""Goosebumps"" (PG, 1:43).Fans of the series may wonder which of the books is the basis for the movie. The answer is none of them – and all of them. Rather than adapting any one of Stine's books, which are, admittedly, relatively short (as Stephen King exclaims, ""Ah-HAH! See?""), this film imagines a world in which Stine's monsters come to life and terrorize a small town, while R.L. Stein himself, along with a few local teenagers, attempt to recapture the creatures and save the town. I won't spoil the movie, except to say that, in the end, we Movie Fans get a film that is as exciting and delightful as any of the books that inspired this story.The film has Jack Black portraying Stine as an unfriendly recluse in the tiny (fictional) town of Madison, Delaware. Showing Stine as a movie character which we get to know as a man, but is only a fictionalized version of the real person recalls movies like Charlie Kaufman's 1999 fantasy comedy-drama ""Being John Malkovich"" or Matthew LeBlanc (starting in 2011) playing himself as an adorable jerk in the Showtime comedy series ""Episodes"". Black's Stine calls himself Mr. Shivers. He's a widower who lives in a big house with his kind, but mischievous 16-year-old daughter, Hannah (Odeya Rush), whom he homeschools. Moving in right next door is Madison High School's new assistant principal, recently widowed Gale Cooper (Amy Ryan), and her teenage son, Zach (Dylan Minnette), still grieving the loss of his father. Gale's sweetly clueless sister, Loraine (Jillian Bell) greets them with open arms, but Zach and Gale simply have a lot of adjusting to do – and new people to meet. Gale is almost immediately hit on by shy fellow educator, Coach Carr (Ken Marino), while an awkward nerd ironically named Champ (Ryan Lee) traps the new guy into a friendship. It's a good thing for Zach that Hannah is such a pleasure to be around.One night when Zach looks towards his new neighbor's house and thinks he sees Mr. Shivers abusing Hannah, he calls Champ and they steal into the house. Zach and Champ see that Hannah's okay, but not before they find a key and open a locked ""Goosebumps"" manuscript among many on a shelf in Mr. Shivers' study. The book is ""The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena"" and unlocking the manuscript allows a large, furry creature to literally jump off the page. The three teens run after him, Hannah telling them that the monster can only be re-captured by sucking him back into the book from whence he came. The Abominable Snowman wreaks havoc on the town until Mr. Shivers shows up to save the day.In the destruction that the creature caused in the study, all the manuscripts fell to the floor and one of them popped open – one releasing the evil Slappy the Dummy. Slappy unleashes complete mayhem in Madison – on the night of a big high school dance nonetheless. The police (a hilarious Timothy Simons and Amanda Lund) are no help, but few people would be. That ventriloquist dummy serves as the ringleader of a gang of dangerous and destructive creations including a wolfman, a maniacal clown, a herd of garden gnomes and a gargantuan praying mantis. They all want revenge on their creator for keeping them locked up so long. And Stein is the only one who even has a chance of stopping them. When Stine's creations come to life, besides clear memories of Robin Williams' 1995 hit ""Jumanji"", this situation reminds us of Emma Thompson's author writing Will Ferrell's character into existence in 2006's ""Stranger Than Fiction"", or the underseen 1979 thriller ""Time After Time"" in which the character of H.G. Wells (author of the sci-fi classic ""The Time Machine"") uses profits from his writing to build a working time machine which one of his friends uses to escape the police and continue a killing spree when it is discovered that he's Jack the Ripper. ""Goosebumps"" deserves a place among these other great films.This film's story may not be completely original, but it feels fresh and it is fantastically well executed. All of the actors are perfectly cast (even Jack Black, who, in our opinion, seems to have had more misses than hits in his career). With the help of a story by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, a script by Darren Lemke and the direction of Rob Letterman, this cast and this story hit the perfect balance between frightening and fun – just like the ""Goosebumps"" books themselves. The script is very funny and the dialog and character interactions are charming from the very beginning to the very end of the movie. The interesting characters, the story's danger and adventure, along with the excitement and humor all seamlessly contribute to a simply wonderful family film that will appeal to kids of all ages, even if they don't know their goose bumps from their speed bumps or their Kings from their Stines.

I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. I loved the original and felt the sequel was just as good as the first!

Don't ruin all the fun asking these.Don't trust Tomatoes or Metacritic. They are no fun. (I don't know why the hate The Predator because I love that movie)In Malaysia, it's an 18-rated movie.

In my opinion...the true horror is that which is real. This story, supposedly based on real crimes, scared the living daylights out of me.

That's an hour and a half I'll never get back.",negative
Cam,"At first, I thought this is going to be a straightforward movie about internet dangers or an average cliché cat and mouse/stalker mystery horror. I was wrong, it is more than that ... it tries to cover many hot subjects of today's society including the desirability in the digital world and how far you are willing to go and expose yourself for fame or money. Inherently, internet dangers and identity theft are presented in a creative way in my opinion.Competition and low self esteem are also key components that drive the action and the decisions of the main character.But due to the lead actress the movie does a very nice job in showing not only the dark side of internet but also the dark side within people. The script is simple but tight, effective and the directing and editing were also good.During the beginning, I thought some supporting cast's lines were poorly written but after the first half I got caught in this eerie, almost virtual feel to the ""reality"".Warning spoilers:Some reviewers are complaining about the loose ends and about the fact that the ending remains unexplained. What is there to explain?
Arnold discovered the pattern: Most chat companies use an algorithm that analyses the girl's behavior and creates a virtual girl. Why? Because of the productivity and the income. A virtual girl could be online 24/7 and demands no share of profit. It's happened before with ""baby girl"", but she couldn't fight back since she was dead. I think she wasn't randomly chosen but due to reasons that include the recent increasing popularity of her persona but also the fact that she worked ""freelance"".",positive

Insidious: Chapter 2,"Insidious brought us the usual haunting story, with a couple new  elements sprinkled in. Chapter 2 does a great job of furthering itself  from the usual fare, by expanding on the elements that made it  different.  One on the elements of this franchise is the focus on ""Astral  Projection"", which is a person subconsciously leaving his/her body and  traveling though a spirit realm (called the ""Further"" in this movie),  leaving the body empty until the soul returns. While projecting, the  soul can interact with other spirits, good and bad. Chapter 2 picks  right up from where the first ended (SPOILER FOR THE 1ST MOVIE! SKIP TO  NEXT PARAGRAPH TO AVOID!) - the father succeeds in rescuing his son's  soul, but something else has taken the father's body in the process.   Is it as scary as the first? That's debatable...if you liked the scares  from the first movie, then you'll get a kick out of some of the  tension- filled moments in this one. If you weren't a fan, then it'll  probably just be more of the same. My opinion - slightly fewer scary  moments, but definitely a few quality jumps, perhaps of a higher  quality than the first. (There's one 3-hit combo in particular that I  thought was really good.)  I will say that I enjoyed how the total story has evolved. Chapter 2  adds a few layers to the lore of this franchise that sparked my  interests, and gives it some good depth. The script is infinitely  better this time around. Patrick Wilson outdoes his previous  performance, and I love anything that Barbara Hershey does. We even get  a few laughs here and there. And James Wan does well to use the  'common-sense-as-viewers- applied-in-the-movie' technique again.  Without giving anything away...when you get a blatant warning, YOU  LISTEN TO IT.  Sound editing was much better this time around, although they still  rely a good amount on the usual dead silence broken by LOUD CRASHES OF  NOISE AND CREEPY MUSIC...  Overall, Chapter 2 makes several improvements on the first, and while,  depending on your tastes, this sequel may or may not be as scary as the  first, I think it's tough to deny that this is a all-around better,  more entertaining movie. And, being such a low-risk, low-budget  project, I'm sure a 3rd movie will be justified.  Insidious: Chapter 2 scores a 3.5 out of 5 on the BDBOS.",positive
Cargo,"When I saw the trailer I was a little weary about this film. I wasn't sure if it would suck like many other indie epidemic survival movies that have been released in the last 5 years. But thankfully I was not right, this film was very good and not your typical infection film. Its about a couple and their infant child dealing with the end of civilization, where a massive epidemic sweeps across the land. I found this to be less about the disease and more about the relationship between parent and child, and the parent doing absolutely anything to help there baby. This really comes through in the film, you really feel the desperation and love, that often is very intense. Very emotional and had me on the edge of my seat a few times. Not to mention the great acting that only adds to the intensity of any given scene. I've always loved Martin Freeman, another great performance from him.The cinematography is absolutely wonderfully done, and is complemented by the beautiful Australian outback. Whoever did the location scouting for this deserves more than A+. You could almost feel the heat, the thirst, the dryness. I cant describe how well the film portrays helplessness and desperation in such times as a massive epidemic, the emotions come through perfectly. I felt connected to the characters, as little as they are, and I was interested until the end of the film. I also worried it may become too slow, but even in the ""slow"" parts were interesting and kept me invested in the story and characters. I really was surprised how much I liked this film, it was a welcome change of pace from the typical Walking Dead rip-off junk.Watch it.",negative

Warm Bodies,"This reviewer was drawn into an early screening designed to generate buzz concerning the worth of the same, so I suppose my end of the deal is to afford such. With this firmly in mind, well - so be it! I rather liked the promotional trailer, drawn as I was to the wry tone and unlikely re-imagining of the zombie genre even as I care little for horror or gore. Fear existed that the premise wouldn't be exploited to the full or that the film would register across just the bits shared in the preview. Such anxieties were misplaced for the film proved consistently entertaining throughout and perhaps better than expected.Much relies upon the capacity of the viewer to accept if not celebrate the understated tone of what is nevertheless an over-the-top zombie picture. The voice over narration provided to us by the 'R' character, affording calm, matter of fact reportage concerning the 'lived experience' of being one of the undead; i.e. charting meaningless time spent will either connect or not connect, where I was pleased to note that the audience in attendance quietly gathered and enjoyed many a little nuance presented for our collective delectation. No one could help by find the tone and direction of this pleasant lark of a date movie anything less than winning. Expect to have a nice time.",negative

When a group of zombies led by R's friend M (Rob Corddry) finds Julie, R protects her. Soon the zombies including R change their emotions and are capable to dream. But the fearful Bonies are seeking out Julie and R to eat them.""Warm Bodies"" is a movie that combines comedy with romance, horror and action genres. The story is brainless since the very beginning; for example, a group of teenagers go to a dangerous environment without any skilled soldier to help them. But the delightful story is worthwhile; the zombie with existential crisis is adorable; Julie comparing R with the cover of Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie"" in Blu-Ray is cult; the chemistry and the romance are adorable and in the end I loved this cute movie.

Summer of 84,"Someone here has already compared this to Ready Player One and I think that's a pretty apt comparison. This movie's idea of recreating nostalgia involves nothing more than a lot of name-dropping and going down a sterile checklist of 80's tropes without seeming to really understand any of them. We've got a retrowave soundtrack that wants to be an homage to the 80's, but doesn't have an authentic feel to it at all. A nerdy kid that looks almost exactly like ones we used to see cast in the 80's and an edgy semi-punk kid that looks as much like young River Phoenix as possible and etc etc, but neither they or any of the other cast have any charisma whatsoever. There's also a badly done montage, an unbelievably cringey romance subplot, a plot we've seen many, many times before, and much more that's all ripped directly from 80's movies/shows, but it never actually manages to properly capture that 80's spirit and just feels like a desperate, hollow attempt to copy familiar things without any real thought put into it. I really don't see what there is to like here. The kids mostly sit around constantly name-dropping 80's movies, talk about jerking off a lot, and then act really weirdly excited that there's a serial killer targeting boys their age nearby. None of it's funny or interesting or at all authentic. Maybe the comparison to Stranger Things is already overdone, but it's still very valid. The kids in Stranger Things have all the charisma and acting talent that these ones don't and they live in a world that has a quality retro atmosphere to it that doesn't rely entirely on making a bunch of lazy retro references. Stranger Things also has its characters surprise you by playing against perceived stereotypes, whereas this just has everyone diving headfirst into being a complete cliche and not even doing that well. Hell, even something like The Guest felt vastly more well done and authentically 80's than this and it doesn't even actually take place in the 80's.There's not really a nice way to say it, but this really is one for the Ready Player One crowd who don't even really care about characters or story quality, as long as someone sits there and reads a list of names of 80's movies and shows to hit their nostalgia hair-trigger.",negative
Summer of 84,"So, a lot of people are comparing this movie to Stranger Things, but they are wrong in almost every regard. While Stranger Thing is a sci-fi adventure rooted in fantasy and unrealistic fiction, this film is as realistic as any news story. It seems like the comparisons come from the 80's soundtrack and the fact that it was 4 young boys on an adventure, but that's where the similarities end. This movie is more along the lines of films like The Goonies or Stand by Me; movies about young men who are taught harsh things about life at an early and fragile age. While Stranger Things was for children, this movie is clearly aimed at a much more mature and discerning audience.The first two act of this film are pretty straight forward and standard; 4 young and immature boys suspect their neighbor of being a serial killer. They break into his house, dig up his garden, ect. in order to find proof of his horrifying acts. But nothing really comes of it, at least nothing concrete. The movie is funny, suspenseful and entertaining, and it reminds you of the kids mysteries that were all the rage in the late 80's.Then, in the final act, the film suddenly makes an 180 and it becomes a serious film with real horror, real stakes and real consequences. Just like real life, the story doesn't end just because you hope it does. Good people are often the victims of their good intentions, and this movie proves it.While the first half of the movie is just an enjoyable coming of age film, the second half is what really sets this movie apart. It's endings like these that make a movie really shine, and separates the audience that always wants a happy ending versus the ones that want a better, more realistic one.Stop judging this movie based on a trailer. It's wrong and idiotic. A movie should be judged on its entire running time, and this movie deserves nothing but the highest praise. Everyone involved should be proud of their work. Amazing.",positive
Annabelle: Creation,"How can this movie have such a high rating? I went to see this one in theaters tonight because I thought it would be good. Instead all I got were some cheap loud sound scares. There was nothing really scary about this whole movie. Every time I thought something scary would happen I got disappointed by a loud sound effect and a flash image.I kept wondering the entire movie why certain characters would do certain things like:Why go back in the room when they know it's dangerous. Why won't they talk with each other whats going on in the house. Why go back in the house after the things that happened. Why create an orphanage in a house the owners know is haunted. And why stay there after the horrible event that happened 12 years ago. Why sit in front of an open door staring in the abyss shooting a toy gun. Why not unbuckle the belt to free yourself from the chair? Why not freak out and flee while you can after seeing the man of the house sucked dry and dead on the floor? Why is there no lights in the house?The story writers probably think the people who go and watch this movie are stupid or something. As viewer you already know whats going on, the movie characters also know whats going on, but they all just stay there and let it happen, making dumb decisions as the movie progresses.They are just lucky the demon is even more stupid then they are..",negative
Annabelle: Creation,"2017 become a good year for horror. I had no high hope watching it, but it's actually surprisingly excellent movie, lots of fun and scary with amazing jump scares. Great cinematography. It's much like ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" from last year which is also a prequel. This movie is very well done! 👌",positive
Mama,"""Mama"" is the first big horror film release of the year, so as a horror movie fan, I really wanted to watch this. It has the name of Guillermo del Toro, not as director as I first thought, but as a producer, so we expected fantastic visuals. I was pleasantly surprised to see Jessica Chastain there too, looking like I have not seen her before, sporting a short dark Joan Jett-hairstyle. This film really had a lot going for it.""Mama"" is a malevolent female spirit who jealously hounds the couple Annabelle (Jessica Chastain) and Luke (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) who adopts a couple of young girls who had been found living wildly in an abandoned cabin in the woods. Throughout this movie, in the way of disturbing dreams and jarring apparitions, we join Annabelle try to discover what exactly ""Mama"" wants that she cannot seem to get. First-time feature film director Andrés Muschietti succeeds to create a horror film that was visually stunning as it was emotionally charged. The stylish look may have been influenced by the producer, Guillermo del Toro. The emotional ride was largely due to the restrained yet effective performance of Jessica Chastain as a single rocker-chick who was suddenly given the unexpected and unwelcome responsibility of being a step-mother to two very disturbed girls.The one drawback for me was ""Mama"" herself, particularly how she looked. I admit I did not really like how she reminded me so much of Sadako (of the ""Ring"" films) in all its obvious computer-generated glory. However, the camera angles used to show ""Mama"" and her point of view were quite innovative. There were gaping plot holes when you think the story through and try to give explanations to ""Mama""'s illogical behavior. But hey, she is a crazy ghost after all! Just sit back, imbibe the creepy atmosphere and feel the emotion in the story.",negative
Mama,"""MAMA"", a film executively produced by Del Toro follows the story of two little girls that are found in the wilderness for five years. They are then adopted by their Uncle Luke (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) and his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain)and right off the bat, strange things start happening. While trapped in the woods, Victoria (Megan Charpentier)and Lily (Isabelle Nelisse) formed a guardian to protect and care for them, who they call Mama.This is an excellent movie. Be warned that it does remain dependant on jump scares to scare you, but they are what I like to call ""true jump scares"". Not a cat bursting out of a corner, or a shoe falling from the sky. ""Mama"" utilizes CGI by creating dark, disturbing images along with a tense orchestral sound track to scare your pants off. The acting was also superb, particularly Jessica Chastain and Megan Charpentier. Isabelle was solid also, but I had a feeling that before every take, she was told what to do, but Megan was old enough to understand the script and story. Something that really impressed me was how the story unfolded, and how beautifully the mother daughter relationship was portrayed. The cinematography was also one of the most beautiful jobs I've ever seen on a horror film. Camera work was steady and the dolly shots were smooth and suspenseful. Overall, Mama was a terrifying horror movie with a beautiful story and wonderful camera work. I hope this movie is recognized as a classic for years to come. This movie also proves that PG-13 horror movies can be scary after all. 9/10.",positive
Flatliners,"There's been this trend in recent years to remake iconic or at least popular movies from earlier years. For the most part these movies have been met with yawns, disinterest and have been rightfully savaged by the critics and viewers. Occasionally you get a good movie out of it but more often then not it's just a big, costly mistake. And so to get around this studios no longer refer to these movies as remakes, but ""reimaginings"". The idea is take the concept of the movie and and try different things. This still doesn't make it a good idea.The 80's version of Flatliners was an interesting movie. The concept of a group of medical students flatlining and then coming back was original. It brought with it elements of horror, existentialism and how our choices can affect both ourselves and others. This one? I struggled to find a positive to give to it and I still can't. This is a bad movie from every single point of view I can give. It follows the same story of a group of medical students who in effect kill themselves for a short period of time to see what's on the ""other side"". Then before brain damage can occur they are brought back but each brings back with them something from their past and they are in effect haunted by this. It's really the same story as the original even if it's executed in a different way. There's nothing else that needs to be said. Same thing but worse. Save your money and rent the original if you want to see this. You'll be happier and it won't cost you as much.",negative
Flatliners,"Flatliners is about a group of students who are not satisfied with their lives and thanks to the initiative of one of them (Ellen Page) they find something beyond comprehension that changes their perspectives about life. The plot itself: Promising.The movie is half sci-fi, normal people trying to surpass the limit of science in a realistic way or at least tied to the ground which cannot be said about the other part, the horror one, where the movie takes another road, a supernatural one. But is interesting in it's on way and it's very well made, in my theater people were really scared. If you're willing to accept this two sides of the movie, you're enjoying it for sure.The acting is good enough. Of course Ellen does a great job and the other actors did a good performance with what they were given.So, why the bad reviews? Well, Flatliners doesn't have the best script and it has ""teenager parts"" but who wouldn't party after that? Anyway, this is not enough for so bad reviews. So, what is it? It's the comparison with the original one. Yes, in case you don't know, this movie is a remake of a 1990 movie. And what almost everyone is doing is comparing this new one with the oldest and it's tiring. What did I do up there? Analyze the movie I went to see to the cinema. And that's it. I don't know why they insist so much on talking about other movie.Flatliners won't change your life but it's a good enough made movie, with good acting, good plot and an excellent combination of horror and sci-fi. Go see it, ignore the critics. You'll enjoy it.",positive
The Final Girls,"Tries to be ""the last action hero"" of slasher movies... Dude, what a bad sh*tload of bad. Not funny, not scary, not gory. Nothing but ""not"". It had 7/10 on IMDb when I watched it, which had to be bought. I honestly cant't picture a scenario where anyone would give a boring mess like this more than 5/10 (and that would be someone who sleeps with the director, I guess). It has it all, a mess of a script, bad acting, a forest of wooden dialog, unfunny ""funny"" one-liners which tries so hard to be funny and cool, that you are one second away from jumping in the screen yourself and offing those suckers yourself just to make the world a better place... A Monster who has nothing original to it. I mean, it is a copy of a copy of a copy of every bad- breath-slasher-Killer you have ever seen. And his kills are totally UNGORY. Duh? You read correct. I mean, I'm not a gore hunter. I can enjoy all kinds of movies, with or without violence. But if you are shooting a picture where the poor folks who you hired to play the poor folks that get sucked INTO a horror-slasher-movie are offed by the killer off-screen, than you have no idea what you are doing. I could get on and on... SO DON'T WATCH IT!!! You will have to see it anyway over and over again, if you are going to hell. So avoid that better too.",negative
The Final Girls,"If your an 80's Horror/Slasher FanBoy like myself then this film is for you. Clever nods to the audience, tongue n cheek, self aware/meta humour is in full force. Think the wit and humour of Scream blended together with Friday the 13th, plus some surprisingly emotional depth. Loved it! I cannot fathom why this did not get a cinema release, it is absolutely brilliant. A clever, knowing, (though never self mocking) homage to 80s slasher flicks. The cast are uniformly brilliant and great to see Nina Dobrev in something other than the Vampire Diaries. If you love Scream and the self referential horror you are sure to enjoy this. Give it a try, this will go down as another of those hidden gems that COME ALIVE on DVD, rather like 'Trick R Treat.' Neglected and ignored when in fact it is sheer brilliance and really quite moving. Lovely commentary too!",positive
Bacurau,"Just viewed Bacurau at the Mill Valley Film Festival and found it incredibly hard to sit through. Clocking in at 2 hours and 10 minutes it was often tedious for me to sit through. While slasher king John Carpenter homages prevail here I am not convinced the genre is effective in making a statement about the right wing political environment in Brazil right now. The critics appear to love it though.If you love dead bodies piling up by the dozens with décapitations, buzzing flies, buckets of blood and some gratuitous sex thrown in for good measure this is the film for you!",negative
Bacurau,"This movie gets you going in a way that maybe you weren't expecting from an action thriller and shows genuine characters that you come to care about really early. It also introduces you to a place that's rough and angry and you realize that there's a perfect symbiosis with this rugged land and with its people. The problems they suffer on a daily basis ( lack of water, food, unwilling and corrupted government officials ), make them to the eye of certain people and corporations as second class citizens and maybe PREY!!!",positive
Odd Thomas,"Corny awful dialogue, especially the 'romance' scenes. Hilariously bad.Despite a stellar cast including Willem Dafoe this is a terrible, terrible film. For some reason every time Odd calls Willem Dafoe's character, he ends up interrupting coitus. (Why?) It makes no sense.I'm not a fanboy of this series or a teenager, but this movie was awfully sh*te.The special effects aren't bad, photography and cinematography are average. THe dialogue and script are just crappier than crap. Do you know That scene in SLumdog Millionaire where the kid gets drenched in faeces? That is what comes to my mind as an appropriate simile or metaphor for the writing in this film.",negative
Odd Thomas,"I will start with a recommendation: ""go watch it"". This movie is definitely worth seeing. I did not red the book , and this movie truly surprised me. The movie unfolds very dynamically. It is not a slow paced movie for sure. The story is also very interesting containing just enough elements to surprise and entertain at the same time. The ending is also done very nicely. The effects are not the best ever seen , but sufficient. The acting was also very good. I admit some of the characters felt a bit dull , not really believable. In a nutshell , go watch it and be amazed how good a movie can turn out even if you never heard of it.",positive
Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse,"Thin, approximately as dense as ""The Boogens"". Worthless character development. A sad, desperate attempt at emulating superior movies such as ""Super Bad"" and ""Shaun of the Dead"".An empty, exploitative teen flick and a failure as a film in all respects.Unlikeable, sickly and feeble. Rotten, hopeless and wretched. Juvenile actors, producers and production staff. What were you thinking? Best remove this from global sale lest you embarrass yourselves further.This kind of ugly purely American aesthetic is a waste of time, effort and money. Mainly time.Nothing recommends it.Avoid.",negative
Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse,"I laughed my ass off while watching this movie. I had no expectations to what I was about to experience and I'm so glad because I did enjoy it. The last crazy zombie movie I watched was 'Cooties' which is truly an off-the-wall delight and 'Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse' is right up there with it. Good show!The synopsis states three scouts attempt to save their town from a zombie outbreak. But that's really not the plot. Their motive is to save their fellow classmates and one of the scouts sister at a rave party to which the three scouts were not invited. The scouts were given an erroneous address and they must find the real address before the zombie get to the rave first. What they go through to get the address is a laugh riot of grotesque zombie horror that is funny and goofy and perfectly timed.Casting, acting, dialog are spot on with the spirit of the movie! Light hearted crazy zombie fun done to perfection!",positive
Ouija: Origin of Evil,"First of all, let me state that I do not consider myself a hardcore horror connaisseur, but I do like to think that I can spot a pile of sh*te when I see one. And boy is this movie a massive sh*tepile!Also, I don't ever do reviews. But I feel like have to step in here.I saw HUSH, it was okay... I saw OCULUS, it was bad... But this one... man oh man... The real horror about this movie is that it manages to score 6.2 on here and even get some good reviews.It is obvious that Mike Flanagan has seen all the James Wan horror flicks. It is also obvious that Mr. Flanagan does not understand what makes these movies good.To make things easy, let's start with the good: - The oldest daughter (Annalise Basso) was pretty convincing (up until the end) - Her boyfriend (Parker Mack) looked like a young Patrick Wilson and wasn't horrible nor important. - ... Nope, that's about it. Other characters: - The mom was bland and boring. Also, more than once the camera stayed on her for too long for her to stay in character - The priest was okay but unnecessary - The youngest daughter wasn't good, but hey, she's young. Even worse was her CGI mouth, though. Flanagan must've thought this looked amazing because we only saw like seven random jump scares with the girl's CGI mouth open wide... - Ghost daddy... why?? what?!The writing is horrible as there are far too many dialogues in which the characters lay out their entire backstory in the most uninteresting way e.g. we don't need to know that the girls' grandmother was a fortune teller.The pacing was incredibly slow. There's one scene in which the girls are alone in the house, which could have been a tense sequence. Instead we see some teenage couple shenanigans and a really tiresome dinner date of two widowed adults. The only purpose being that we know the priest lost his wife and we can move on to the seance scene...Almost every moment of this movie felt like I'd seen it somewhere before only slightly/a lot better: - The 60s feel from ""The Conjuring"" - The medium hoax setup - The black monsters from ""Insidious"" - The gaping CGI mouth from 100 movies - The pupil-less eyeballs - The slingshot scene - The lips sewn together - The jump scare cliffhanger before the credits - The girl saying ""it seems really dumb to split up"" - The fact that they do split up even after the girl said the previous... Almost all of it is a badly rip off from another (or 10 different) movie(s).ALMOST! The one thing that was a first for me was the ""plot"". If I understand correctly, the family is being terrorized and eventually killed off by an angry mob of Polish Jew ghosts? The priest explains that the ghost possessing the little girl was (a) rescued from a concentration camp by allied soldiers (b) brought back to America only to (c) be kidnapped buy some crazy Nazi doctor who experiments on Jews in a basement in an American suburb... These experiments primarily being your typical torture stuff(?) like sewing mouths shut, cutting vocal cords, cutting in general...Oh and then the priest drops something along the lines of ""but there was something else in the darkness, something that had never been human to begin with""... So demons? Do you mean demons, priests? Can you tell us more about those inhuman fiends please?! No? Oh... you want to keep the focus on the Polish Jew ghosts? Oh, OK... So don't torture Jews or they will possess innocent kids and slaughter families? That's not a weird moral at all...So... don't spend money on this. Please don't. I haven't seen the other Ouija movies... but if this is the best one as stated by a reviewer before me, I will stay as far away from them as possible.",negative
Ouija: Origin of Evil,"I'm a casual horror fan at best. I've seen a number of horror films spanning several time periods, from Hitchcock to 80's slasher films to a few from the 21st Century. Still, I'm not a huge horror buff, and I don't take in scary movies time and again the way that some people do.That being said, I found ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" to be the perfect horror movie for someone like myself who likes a good scary movie now and then, but isn't a huge horror buff. The movie is very well made, features good acting and has an intriguing plot. And, again taking into consideration my personal comfort zone with these type of movies, I found it to be the right blend of scary but not over the top intense. The movie is not very gory at all (it's rated PG-13--a rating I find appropriate for this film), and while it certainly does have its creepy side, it's not the kind of thing that's going to keep you up all night. Well, I suppose that's a subjective thing--but for me I found it to be a fun kind of scary, rather than an overly unsettling film.In light of all that, I'm giving this movie 9/10 stars--a rating that I give to relatively few movies. I feel that this movie is deserving of that because it nails its aim, which is to be a well made horror flick that is ""family friendly"" so to speak, i.e. suitable for a teenage audience. If I had teenage kids, I'd definitely feel comfortable letting them see this movie--and I wouldn't mind sitting through it with them, as it was fun for me as an adult. Having seen it on October 25th, it's definitely helped get me in the mood for Halloween here in a few days!",positive
Victor Frankenstein,"Im just speechless as i saw that this movie got a rating as high as 6.2, i'm sure that most people who gave it a high rating saw only the trailer at best.let me tell you a little about this movie without spoiling and pray god that my English will be understandable, well what this movie is about is that you wait for something to happen and you wait and you keep waiting and.... it happens, but when it happens actually nothing happens, to summarize it two weirdos make something to destroy it in the end, exactly like a kid who makes a sand castle but in the end he gets bored and destroy it.This movie is a waste of time.",negative
Victor Frankenstein,"This movie is exceedingly British and I love that. I don't want to go into too much detail with this review, but there were so many great things about this movie to the extent I could write a lengthy book about the things I admired in this film.The accents were sublime and posh, the technology of the era was just about right without going too over the top and making people weird and anti-social and due to the lack of cars and relatively slow movement of people it makes me appreciate my lovely electric bike much more, when I'm doddering along at 15 mph on it I think back to those Victorians in this film who would've been delighted with such quick speeds, I fantasise about Victor accompanying me on his steampunk steam powered bike doing 15 mph and having a great laugh with him, my imaginary friend known as Victor Frankenstein wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for this film. All the characters seem so politically sane in this film which is a very refreshing breather from today's harsh, stupid political climate.Also the monster at the end of this film looks very tasty so this film always gives me a great appetite and gives me a longing for some delicious rats, balut, black pudding and mum's foot sweat every time I watch this amazing film. The scenery was truly beautiful and the scenes of London outside made me smell the sweet smell of steam power which made me nostalgic for the old steam ralleys I went to as a kid. You'll enjoy this film if you're British but I don't recommend it to Americans as Americans would probably get too jealous of Victorian London.",positive
Eli,"I seriously don't know and can't understand, why and how this film could receive ratings above, say, 4 at all.At times the story is more than ridiculous, the acting poor, often you get the strong feeling that even the cast did no longer care about the hidious screenplay and unbelievably stupid dialogue. Kelly Reilly came across very unnaturally and her over the edge performance stood out negatively.Eli's room did change between cuts within the same (!) scene, sometimes his bed would stand right next to the wall, the next moment in the middle of the room. Ever heard about continuity?!I can understand why this film directly went to Netflix instead of cinemas/box office.",negative
Eli,"I thought this movie was very well done and kept my attention throughout.I don't care what it compares to or this and that.I watch movies to just enjoy the movie, not some historical review of past movies.The acting was good, the story was good, and it kept me thinking ""what's next"".Well done.",positive
Captive State,"I don't know where to start because this movie doesn't even know where it's going. The first hour of the movie has no action or aliens yet the trailer made it look like some cool action movie. There is absolutely no character building so you don't give a crap about the cast to the point where you don't even know who is who or what the character's names are. Do yourself a favor if you are thinking about watching this movie and don't. A waste of time, money and film.",negative
Captive State,"This is probably the best sci fi movie to come out since Children of Men. The reviews I've read from this are atrocious... Den of Geek says that the scenes just ""happen."" What?! Isn't that what a movie should be? Geekwire says that the movie lacks a presence of aliens.... WHAT?! This is a thinking man's sci fi with some of the most tense scenes filmed that I've seen for a long time. This is what would happen in a police state.... Go into it with a fresh approach and you will leave ultimately satisfied. Don't go into it thinking it's some super hero movie... Because honestly Joseph Campbell's a heros journey can only be told so many times. And in all honestly - this is the best movie thus far of 2019.",positive
47 Meters Down: Uncaged,I sat down to watch this movie with unbiased Hope's as I do with any shark movie lover. It started off bland and I was bombarded with cheesy and vague character development. The old cliche highschool bully story and the sister or friends that stand up for the victim. The foreshadowing was the most obvious thing. Straight shot to let's sneak behind peoples backs and go cave diving all the while telling 0 people where we are going. That's not even all of it. Sharks that can somehow live in a cave so long that they evolve but didnt make it out? Yet they can literally swim backwards and are blind. The real kicker is the fact that they go off hearing instead of the pores on their snout. Oh and get this they decide to add in a few cheap jump scares to add suspense and kill off the people you were rooting for except for get this - the sisters- big surprise. The list goes on and on but I'm getting infuriated just attempting to type this review. Save your 10 dollars and go buy a cheap pair of swimming goggles if you want some real entertainment.,negative
47 Meters Down: Uncaged,"If you go into this movie looking for anything other than dumb, popcorn entertainment. Turn off your brain and don't think about the plot holes. I did, and I ended up really enjoying it. It was actually one of the scariest movies that I've seen in a long time. Let me start off by saying that I'm mildly claustrophobic and just the premise of being trapped in an underwater cave with the entrance blocked had me my skin crawling. But the jump scares were effective, too. And they didn't try to justify the silliness with science or anything else. They just leaned into it. I would suggest anyone seeing this movie do the same.",positive
Jigsaw,"How can you guarantee that your movie will leave as many people disappointed as possible? You create a sequel to what was an amazing franchise and then create something so kitch, so tasteless, a movie that leaves the audience struggling to relate because you put no effort into making anything of the movie even a little bit believable. I strongly believe these kinds of lazy productions should be discouraged. The bar for what gets screened is already way too low as it is.",negative
Jigsaw,"Even though people rarely admit it, the 'Saw' series has been one of the highest quality horror series ever made. 'Jigsaw' is the eighth entry in the series and there is still yet to be a bad film made amongst them. Some are undoubtedly better than others, but I defy you to point me out one that is inherently bad. I also defy you to show me another horror series (even any type of series at all is rare) that has maintained quality across that many films. That's why I was so happy that 'Jigsaw' was a brilliant movie, because if they had come back seven years later only to put forward a bad film for the sake of making money it would have ruined everything. Luckily that was not the case though.While this one does follow the formula used in all the past films, it also feels quite unique in a number of ways. The original seven films were all set within a very tight time-frame. This one of course is pushing ten years into the future. This adds layers of intrigue to the proceedings, because how could 'Jigsaw' be committing these crimes when he died all those years back? And you just know they're going to have a brilliant answer to that question.As far as the traps go in this one, I'm not too sure how I feel. None of them were bad, however none of them really blew me away either. My favourite one (without giving away any spoilers) was actually the most simple one in the film involving a gun. The psychology behind that one is what I loved. I love when these films aren't afraid to be intelligent.The twist in this one also caught me completely off-guard. I've heard people say they weren't entirely convinced by it and felt that the film cheated, however I disagree. Nothing is off limits coming in a 'Saw' movie. You have to know that going in. Altogether I absolutely loved this film and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who is in anyway interested in the genre.",positive
Unsane,"This review won't state anything someone else hasn't said more eloquently, but by god I have to add my own to the reviews because of my disgust with the decently high rating despite an awful , incomprehensible, and unbelievable plot. The movie starts out well with the viewer uncertain about what is real and what may be a delusion we are seeing from the protagonist's point of view. Then after a very drawn out and tedious key scene, it falls apart, combusts, and you are left with the ashes flying into your face wondering how anyone did or said any of the things they did.",negative
Unsane,"I had no idea this was shot using an iphone until I checked the reviews. I'm a huge fan of horror and though this is more thriller it completely satisfied me in every way- the story, writing, acting, and ending. I have no idea what the bad reviews are talking about.",positive
The Last Days on Mars,"First off. The description for this film states that it was made at Elstree Studios, Borehamwood, England. The interiors and sound were both done at Ardmore Studios, Bray, Ireland. Just thought I'd put that out there.It's basically a zombie movie set on Mars. People develop an infection, die, come back and again and try to kill the nearest person. Who carries on in similar fashion. Never been done before so.You get the impression watching it that the director has seen a few sci-fi movies. He just doesn't have anything original to add to the genre.The script is pedestrian, humourless, predictable; with no sense of the impending doom that should have bled from the screen. From the moment the Russian guy falls into the hole in the ground, you can pretty much figure out what's gonna happen. And it does. Exactly as you'd expect it to.Films are supposed to take you out of yourself, surprise you, entertain you, immerse you in the world that they have created. This film did none of those./yawn.",negative
The Last Days on Mars,"This review is intended to win over those who love sci-fi, but feel a little wary of even viewing The Last Days of Mars due to the poor overall review ratings. There is a severe dearth of science fiction movies out there, let alone good ones, so if you're like me then you can identify with allowing yourself to relish in whatever a movie does well to immerse you and bring sci-fi to the screen convincingly.First, I'll tell you what I want to see when a sci-fi movie involves a space theme. I want equipment, vehicles, space ships and sets to look detailed, interesting and look like they belong there. I think they did an excellent job with all this. I'm sure an astronaut or annoying know-it-all snobs could point out whatever may be incorrect, but it all looked awesome to me. It made me feel like everything was filmed on mars, or in a space station etc.Long before I ever saw this movie I recall having read that it was very low budget. It never looked that way to me. Everything looked so professionally designed. To give an example, I loved how the land vehicles looked. They were a typical 6 wheeled monster, but were particularly detailed with what looked like logos of tech sponsors and flags of whatever countries were imagined to be involved in space exploration. That was some subtly added depth for me.The special effects and CGI looked flawless to me including a small zero gravity scene and flashback scenes of a space station for example. The backgrounds outdoors on mars also looked quite impressive to me as well. I've never really seen photos of Mars, but the rock formations looked foreign to me. I couldn't tell you if they were CGI composites or not. That's a good thing. Overall, I am astounded they could accomplish what they did with just £7,000,000 for the budget. I would have expected to see cheaply painted foam rocks at every turn, plain white panels everywhere and no CGI whatsoever for that price. The acting never really takes a back seat for me, but it was amazing by any standards I would hold for any high budget drama movie. The cast was absolutely fantastic including the supporting actors. The dialogue and behaviour of the characters never had me rolling my eyes either. Many of the characters were easily likable and the one that we are meant to dislike manages to be dynamic within the story line. That's rare in this type of movie. The story is zombie themed as you may have read. I'm painfully aware of how overdone this theme is, and although this take on zombies won't surprise or scare you in new ways, it doesn't ruin the movie. The reason is because the characters seem to behave believably and the zombies don't possess more power than the usual superhuman toughness you've come to expect. Thankfully, you won't see idiotic scenes that countless horror movies do with characters putting themselves in stupider situations than you could even imagine. If you must slam the story for being typical and mediocre for its story I can't really argue with you, but I sure as hell am not willing to listen to you. This movie won't ever top some of my favourites, such as Solaris (1972), or Moon (Sam Rockwell), but once again, if you want to see a movie where the sets and technology make you feel like you're in space, you will get some enjoyment out of The Last Days on Mars. The superb acting and cast is a welcome surprise bonus.",positive
Annabelle,About a minute into this film I squealed out of fear when they put the Annabelle doll into frame. I have a genuine fear of dolls like this. They freak me out. Therefore I was excited about this movie - I sincerely thought that there would finally be another movie out there that would manage to scare me (I have 3 in total so far). Sadly this is not the case. The movie was boring and predictable. The worst thing was that they have this terrifying creature-object-thing to make good use of and they failed miserably at using it. I'm genuinely disappointed at the reuse of the same old washed up horror storyline. How'd this script even get approved??! booo! I wish I wrote it so they could actually see what fear of a doll is haha.,negative
Annabelle,"I'm not the type to write long reviews & give too much unnecessary details. But overall I'm giving this movie a 9 out of 10. I really enjoyed it and would probably watch it again as we get closer to Halloween. The movie had a good story line, and nothing stood out as being too fake or unrealistic. This movie was very well made. I would definitely recommend to watch it this October during the Halloween season. There were definitely plenty of ""jumping in your chair"" moments and plenty of people screaming in the theater. I think ""most"" people would enjoy watching it.",positive
The Love Witch,"The Love Witch is Anna Biller's second feature film and my first time watching any of her works. The film is artistically spectacular - Costumes, shot making, colours, dialogue delivery - and original in scope. Biller commits to her genre (classic horror) and period-look (mid-sixties to early seventies, think ""I Dream of Jeannie"" or ""Bewitched"") and uses satire to turn the patriarchy on its head. It's a lot to try to accomplish in two hours. The film isn't without a few flaws. Sometimes the script is too thick and the pacing too slow, but overall, The Love Witch distinctively shines. Biller has a lot of promise as a director.",negative
The Love Witch,"I was fooled by the 6 rating and it is the worst movie ever!!! It is a flop on all accounts, script,acting, plot, and directing!! Seriously!!???

The judgements and discussions that occurred during the film made me realize how judgemental we really all are. Even though it is very dialogue heavy, I didn't get bored. In fact I couldn't believe how quickly the time passed. So glad I watched it..... wish I could forget it and watch again....",positive
Truth or Dare,"Is a phrase someone should have said to those who proposed this premise, which of course has been done (better) 100 times already.It's inane teen fodder, poorly acted by low budget players, poorly written, poorly shot and fundamentally just poorly done.There are plenty of better horror movies out there to see, even if you fancy teen eye candy (if that is what these teens were meant to be?).In an era where singers are auto-tuned but still deemed good by the youth of today, it is no surprise that this cast might be deemed good also, it's just a pity no one has yet invented an 'auto-act' machine, or an 'auto-writeascript' machine.Certainly don't waste money seeing this trash in a cinema, I would guess this will be available online within a matter of days.",negative
Truth or Dare,"After reading all of the negative reviews, I went into this movie fully expecting it to be a dud. But Regal is offering extra benefits for seeing 4 Universal movies this year (this is one of the 4), so I said what the heck. Wow, was I pleasantly surprised. I really ended up getting into this movie. It's so different, very unique, filled with creative ideas, and entertaining throughout. The movie held my attention and it flew by. But the ending is where this movie will be remembered the most. It is without a doubt one of the most CLEVER ENDING's I've ever seen. The ending alone is worth going to see this movie. I have a strong feeling that too many people went into this movie with a negative bias, thus the reason for all of the negative reviews. It is also clear that most people clearly missed the entire premise of the ending, otherwise there would be more people on here raving about the brilliant ending to this movie. I certainly didn't see it coming. If you are one of the few who actually understand the ending, then you will definitely walk out of this one with a smile on your face.",positive
Happy Death Day 2U,"There's a plot point in this movie where the lead character cannot decide if she should sacrifice her mom's life so she can date some random guy she's known for less than two weeks, or let her mom live and not date the guy she literally just met. Like, yeah, choose the new guy over your mom's life. There are plenty of mom's in the sea! Boyfriends are forever! And that's just the tip of the stupidberg. The science behind everything is so cartoonish. At one point, the scientist who invented it even tries to kill his other timeline self in order to stop the device from going off. That's right, he resorts to murdering his other self instead of, you know, just explaining things TO HIMSELF. But wait! There's more stupid! The timelines now get changed so much that the killer is now someone else. And this is where the movie will really piss you off most. With the first killer, the motivation worked, but with the new killer, the motivation is so paper-thin, it's like the writers had to pick someone so they rolled some dice. And if you're here for the horror, guess what? The real horror is finding out this is secretly a feel-good, rom-com. Not even kidding. The (actual) killer is rarely even in the movie. If you must watch this movie, get a bunch of friends together so you can at least share some laughs while you all make fun of it.",negative
Happy Death Day 2U,"Entertaining, fast paced, and really funny. And also a good amount of Back to the Future references. It definitely worth a watch.",positive
Before I Wake,"Warning Spoilers! I was very disappointed after seeing this movie, it was mostly predictable jump scares and everything was very rushed or not explained enough. The ending really upset me most of all when Kate Bosworth goes to the orphanage to take back Cody while all his nightmares are being released. For the first time the Canker monster decided to eat any of the people there and on top of that every time Bosworth came face to face with a nightmare she easily walked away from it. Then she sees this monster thing and gave it a hug and instead of it becoming Cody's actual birth mother (which the monster is based off of) it becomes Cody, cause you know that makes sense... Anyway Bosworth takes Cody home without any trouble, literally none, the woman who runs the orphanage is just like meh okay take him. Then Cody learns all about how the canker monster became his fear and how all those people that went missing that were eaten were just gone forever, not like anyone really looked into their disappearances from the start though. But hey Bosworth gets a new son because hers drowned no questions asked (no you will never find out how he managed to drown or why she blamed her husband for his death)",negative
Before I Wake,"I scored this a 10. Let me tell you why:Rarely does a film surprise me at all but this film certainly did. Mike Flannigan created an enigmatic speculative on childhood love, loss, fear and death that is both uniquely interpretive and otherworldly fantastical. For those who go into this film anticipating a run-of-the-mill horror film with gruesome effects and bloody deaths, you will be exceedingly disappointed. This film is provocative in that it makes you think and feel throughout. It is at times vastly uncomfortable, but magnificently redemptive. What it achieves is a rare feat- one I would classify more in the realm of Pan's Labyrinth than something like The Ring. What it suffers from is completely misdirected and misleading marketing which has done this gem a huge disservice. I'd watch it again. I'd recommend it to friends. Refrain from judging it based on the posters or the trailer. It's far greater than it's packaging and will probably be better received by audiences who expect more substance.",positive
In the Tall Grass,"There's a limit to how scary grass and being lost can be! In the Tall Grass is about a brother and a sister decide to help a little kid find his way back after calling them for help, they decide to go into a field of tall grass yet soon they discover that the grass field is not what it seems and there may be no way out.The movie start interesting but falls short by its repetitive nature as you find yourself by the middle of the movie - as you get used to the sequence - stuck in a story loop that repeats itself too much that it gets frustratingly. The poor casting choices of the lead characters (the siblings and the boyfriend) who can barley act adds to this frustration which leads you to simply lose interest.Clearly the keys of the plot could've be summed in half the duration of the movie and still delivers. It's an example of how an interesting idea can be ruined by dragging the story for too long.",negative
In the Tall Grass,"This is one of those movies, if you fail to miss a small scene, then it will really confuse the hell out of you. My understanding of this movie is that the big giant rock in the centre of the field is linked to the church. In the bible, the New Testament the redemption word group is used to refer both to deliverance from sin and to freedom from captivity. The two main characters story is that Becky is leaving to give her child away to another family and leaving her husband. When they both hear a voice of a child calling for help. Both go into the field searching for him.What happens next they are all lost and searching for one another. Why I say the Rock is the redeemer, you touch it and it shows you the way back out? Simple- Ross has touched it and instead he turned into a greed man, who wanted nothing but to keep selling the idea of touching the rock is amazing- resembling a liar of a salesman; at the beginning of the story you see him on the phone talking to a member of staff regarding being untruthful, deceptive. That's why he would never show others the way around as he just wanted other to buy the idea of touching the rock.Tobin touched it; he was a child and said he knew the way out at the beginning- told Travis to touch it but he didn't. Tobin was free of sin and that's why nothing had happened to him.Becky; didn't touch the rock but the rock showed her a big lesson- of not giving the child away by feeding her the child, one flesh.Cal touched it; he Continued to die every-time, why because loved his sister more then he should, he kept telling her to continue the journey it giving your child away and leaving the father, he pushed Travis- attempted murder and continued to sin.Travis touching the rock- killed Ross first who was a man of sin to save himself and the rest. By touching the rock he did find the way out, sent the child back to stop Becky and Cal every entering the grass and stopping Travis every coming to search for them. The boy turns up in the church a person free of sin to send a message to Becky that taking the child away from his father is a bad idea, so she decided to return and stop by the police station to help the child as his parents are dead, dad being a sinner and killing his wife.It is a moving maze with only one way out, touch the rock and if you are sin free you are redeemed back into the church.",positive
Velvet Buzzsaw,This movie is as bad as this review.Do yourself a favor and stare at the air for 110 minutes instead of watching that snoozefest.,negative
Velvet Buzzsaw,"The movie is an ambitious attempt that suffered from one major problem. The movie's great ambition is to define art, true art that expresses a true human experience, and to differentiate it from overpriced items collected by dumb rich people who wish to buy taste and sophistication with money.
The movie's major problem is that it failed to translate this message into a comprehensible cinematic experience which could reach, and be enjoyed by, the largest possible audience. What A pity . Let me try to show you how this happened:The story here is a fantasy based on an interesting magical assumption: What if the experience reflected by each and every work of art becomes real, and becomes felt by those who look at it.
What if art becomes ""so moving"" that it actually moves before your eyes, vibrant with life?What if the monsters on a painting come alive to reflect the suffering that led the artist to draw them? What if the pain, fear, melancholy, menace and agony reflected by a work of art all become physical and materialized?The only factor that would allow you to survive and keep your sanity in such case would be the honesty of reflection, honesty of art. Any pretense in representing your feelings can devour you, any pretense in assuming you can reciprocally understand other people's feelings through their art can turn you to a prey for their torments. You can only be safe in such conditions if you stick to the real feelings. Only then can you create real art.To do that, you need to create your art by yourself for yourself, not as a posh pretentious craftsman catering to the taste of a market, but as a playful child, messing around on a beach, making circles in the sand for no one but himself to see.
An impressive concept executed in such an enigmatic way that is guaranteed not to be understood by almost everyone who watches it! What a waste of excellent acting and amazing cinematography.However, one can always assume that maybe the director was just a playful child, making circles on the sand, not really expecting anyone to enjoy watching him do so!",positive
Lights Out,"Lights out an eerie silhouette of a human-like creature loiters down the hall. You repeatedly blink in an attempt to mould its blurred lines, but the dishevelled contour of the unfathomable spectre remains absolutely motionless. Lights on nothing there. Lights out it's moved a couple of inches near you, and your breath starts to come in short gasps. Lights on a tinge of stinging pain strikes your bloodshot eyes, and sweat covers your petrified face. You hesitatingly move your fingers upon the switch and take an abrupt stop in the middle to wonder what will happen the next time the lights go out. Well, let's see. Lights out perhaps, you shouldn't have been so curious.In 2013, Swedish filmmaker, David F. Sandberg, put out one of the most iconic horror short-film experiences that the internet had ever experienced. By that time, all the corners of the virtual realm were awash with the amateurish spine-tingling stories, and the emergence of urban legends, such as The Slenderman. They galvanised aspiring writers to leave their marks on virtual forums, but a selected few decided to take their projects to a whole new level by transferring them to a wider scope.Lotta Losten, who played the nameless main character in the short-film version, enacts a below-par reinterpretation of the same scene, which filled our hearts with sheer dread on Youtube. This time, she plays a woman who works in a mannequin warehouse, and, while clocking out, happens to have a ghastly encounter with a ghoulish presence; However, she's able to sheer away from a gruesome fate. Subsequently, she warns her boss, Paul, about what she saw. He doesn't seem to give much thought to it, but later on, while walking down a dimly lit hall, he comes across a monstrous apparition, which drags him into the darkness, and mauls him to death.The story follows the brothers, Martin and Rebecca, trying to fathom the depression episodes of their mother, Sophie, who happens to have an unexplained connection with the same demonic entity, who attacked Paul, their stepfather. Rebecca is the typical rogue girl who's then telephoned by the school, where her brother studies, to talk about his sleeping in the class, of which he attributes to the same entity which happened to haunt his sister. Rebecca feels beholden to become his responsible guardian, inasmuch as her mother is not of sound mind to look after the boy, and that's when the very same monstrosity that traumatised her childhood, decides to lurk in the shadows of her bedroom one more time.Unfortunately, the adapted version falls short in offering an immersing narrative compared to the original one. The short-film is well-off for uneasiness. It relates to the blood-curdling sensation of going to the kitchen, in the middle of the night, to get a glass of water, and feeling that, at any moment, a gelid hand will sneak up on you. The foundations of the original piece are the imaginary phantasmal beasts, which are masterfully woven due to mere creaks and noises.The experience does not establish a favourable pace in order to evoke a heartfelt sympathy towards the characters. The film doesn't take too long to showcase its premise by walking us through its mechanics. A glowing lamp pops up in the screen signalling its importance in the narrative and it appears that the whole story is used as a mere background for its successful jump scares extravaganza. 'Lights Out' didn't seem to have inherited the same traces that its predecessor could have bequeathed, instead, it limits itself as a roller-coaster filled with jump scares that do not allow the viewer to take in the events. Notwithstanding, it does not entirely fail to regale us. The formula can be categorised as hackneyed, but gets its message effortlessly through to us by simply saying: Grab a torch and give darkness a wide berth. Lights Out enjoy the ride.Verdict: 2/5",negative
Lights Out,"I personally think this movie is one of the greatest horror movies ever! Teresa Palmer and Gabriel Bateman's acting is very good, absolutely credible, almost like Rosa Byrne's performance in Insidious, which was flawless. The cinematography was good, dark scenes pretty clear, intense sound effects well achieved.If you go to the cinema with your childhood fears, you will really enjoy this movie. It's full of scares and if you put attention to them, they are the kind of scares that you really fear when you are a kid.I don't understand why people cannot leave their critics-attitude at home and simply enjoy this movie or any other movie. If they do it, you'll enjoy it a lot.",positive
It Comes at Night,"This movie had a 5 million dollar budget, and I feel like 1 million was spent on the movie and the other 4 spent on fake reviews on sites like IMDb. This movie was one of the largest pieces of garbage I have ever seen.*Spoiler*Nothing comes at night. If you read the positive reviews for this movie they like to pretend you should imagine what would come at night. I did not pay $13 a ticket to imagine anything. On top of that, one of the main characters is left tied to a tree through a night or 2 and guess what... Nothing comes to eat him, make him sick, or even tickle his toes. We saw this movie at the Alamo Draft House and I was very confused when they started handing out checks as that usually happens after the climax of a movie, and this movie never had that. To sum the movie up, his grandpa is put down like a sick animal at the start of the movie then nothing happens for about 20 minutes. Some guy shows up at his house by breaking in, they go to pick up this guys family and some goats. While on the road, they run in to a couple of guys who they beat up and kill. At this point, they lead you to believe the guy who wandered up to his house knew the people in the forest, but they just ignore that and bring the guys family and goats home. Then you spend another 20 minutes with nothing happening and then the dog runs away. What did the dog run away to chase? You never find out. The dog shows up sick a few nights later and some how this ""door that only the dad has a key to gets unlocked"". How did that happen and why did everybody blame the kid when the dad has the only key? Well, if you asked that, you will never find out because they just go ""Oh well, lets all go to our separate rooms"". While in their rooms the mom hugs and kisses her kid, the kid who touched the other little kid. Why did the kid die at the end from the disease and the mom not die? How is the disease spread? Nobody took proper precautions to prevent the spread of a disease. Putting a mask on for a few minutes doesn't protect you if it's airborne as you are all still hanging out together. Hugging and kissing your kid who may be infected is also an easy way to get the virus, disease, whatever it was. Save your money, this movie is full of plot holes, almost no story and just plain sucked. I am disappointing I didn't go see the house instead. That one got bad reviews, but at least I would have known that going in to it and wouldn't have been lead to believe this movie was going to be good by a bunch of lying hipsters. Seriously, read their reviews, this movie is not ""profound"" or even a movie you need to ""think"" to understand. It's a piece of garbage, low budget movie that was passed off as a blockbuster with a bunch of fake reviews.",negative
It Comes at Night,"There's a lot of discussion on here as to whether this film constitutes a horror film or something more akin to a psychological drama.As a horror film, I didn't find the film scary, and as a psychological drama, not particularly fresh in what it was presenting. I consider 'The Road' as a much, much stronger example of a film that blends horror and psychological drama - in exploring the limits of humanity & family in an apocalyptic setting.It's nonetheless a well-made film with fine performances, but I came into the film expecting...something great, which it wasn't. That's hype for you.",positive
The Silence,"You only need a blender to kill these creatures, yet they take over the world?Stupid movie, there's no reason to fear those creatures as they are easy to trap and destroy!Come on guys, this is ridiculous! Those critters are blind and hunt on sound only, a simple thing like a noisy blender would attract them and kill them easily and in great numbers, just as shown in one scene where they massively fly into a wood chipper machine and are chopped to pieces by the hundreds. Hey, a meat grinder or even a document shredder would do the job! Yet everybody has to move north to colder zones in order to survive because those little monsters can't stand the cold!Also noise can easily be used to manipulate them, whether to attract them or to lure them away, also shown in another scene, so there are so many easy ways to get rid of them that the whole movie makes no sense at all!These creatures come in great numbers, but depend on their ears to locate their prey and on their teeth to attack them. This is such a great weakness that they pose only a threat for really stupid and careless people. The army? The police? Just ran away? Got killed perhaps?The movie could have been more fun with some more realism or at least more logic, showing some creative methods to fend of a light threat resulting in a happy ending. For example a barking dog wearing a spiky armor, complete with helmet, it would attract vesps and have them killed by empaling themselves on the spikes of the armor. Also chainmail is effective against bites, especially from smaller creatures, so come on, where's the one eyed guy that is supposed to be king in the world of the blind?This movie could have been a very good one, but as usual original ideas tend to turn into completely worthless movies. This is one of them.The Tremors franchise is a lot better, at least they don't take themselves too seriously and there's less inconsistencies.The Silence is an absolute failure. Not worth your time.",negative
The Silence,"Overall this is a decent enough time killer. It's got a good cast, and some wonderful music and scenes. The problem is the story as a whole.The ""monsters"" made little sense in terms of the threat the movie wanted to make them portray. Not much thought was put into them other than ""we need a monster"". While they might be decent as a ""Pitch Black"" style swarm monster on a small scale, they do not work for what the movie intended. There's just so many things wrong with them.Add to that the incredibly bad ending, that was clearly a rush job and honestly added nothing to the movie. It was clearly a case of the writers trying to sound wise and simply failing horribly.This is a movie you can waste a bored afternoon watching, but there's far better ones out there.",positive
The Shallows,"Wow. Just wow. Even if you are the king of suspension of disbelief this may prove a challenge. Severed but crawling upper body (zero blood pressure hello?)? A buoy with a flare gun, really? A self-impaling shark, why!? With Blake Lively being seriously outplayed by the fine acting of Steven Seagull, I feel she might want to a) get acting lessons and/or b) get an agent who can cut through the trash scripts. All those shampoo commercial shots of her derriere, cleavage and hair for the first twenty minutes made me think I was watching Fox. This movie makes In the Deep (2016) seem like a profound and meaningful masterpiece.This movie is pure garbage. You have been warned.",negative
The Shallows,"It first I didn't know what to expect from this movie, as it has become so hard to take shark movies seriously, however The Shallows not only surprised me, it is the best shark movie since Jaws and honestly the best creature feature in ages!At only 85 minutes, this movie absolutely makes the most of that run-time and its 17 million dollar budget and delivers a tense, gripping, stress inducing movie that will constantly keep you on the edge of your seat. Blake Lively is on her way to stardom, as she carries this entire movie and is able to act without speaking, which is insanely hard to do. You care about her and you want her character to survive. The movie is insanely smart and the Director deserves all the credit in making a movie that honestly should not have worked and made it a classic in this genre.The shark is absolutely terrifying and the way Lively is able to not only face off against this shark, but how she is able to make the most over her situation while being under-prepared was not only intelligent, but believable. The story is simple, straight forward, believable and so genuinely crafted, stylishly executed, and not a single scene is wasted. Director Jaume Collet- Serra will have no problem landing a future big budget Hollywood Blockbuster and Blake Lively will soon find herself as a leading lady more often.The Shallows is the biggest surprise of the year, with gripping tension, a career performance from Blake Lively, beautiful scenery, an amazing story of will and survival and one big, mean, scary shark, The Shallows is a Summer movie that you don't want to miss! 9 out of 10",positive
Texas Chainsaw,"Beyond all the pink-cheeked, bated-breath laudation that has come from critics and horror aficionados in the 38 years since the release of the original film, it's not a stretch to say that the two things that worked together so effectively in the execution of the original was the stark, naturally-lit and flat documentarian style of cinematographer Daniel Pearl and the sparse writing of Hooper and Henkel, whose utter lack of exposition lend a terrifying, claustrophobic immediacy in counterpoint to sun-baked Southern Gothic vistas, which place the viewer squarely and unremittingly in role of Hitchcock's man filming in the corner, with all of the legendary director's flinch-inducing atmospherics and not of whit of his restraint, such as it was.With so much latitude in which to effect a direct sequel (apparently given a seal of approval by Hooper, undoubtedly for monetary incentive and despite his directing a direct sequel in 1986), with so little to hamper questions of plot or motivation, Texas Chainsaw 3D fails so completely and morosely that one might wonder for whom the film was even made, for it definitely was not for a viewer with any sense of taste or even the ability to do basic arithmetic.It is generally understood that the events of the first film take place in 1973 or '74. Once this film left the confines of those few brief sequences which dovetail immediately from the end of original, in which a lynch mob and the most ineffectual sheriff ever are party, directly or indirectly, to picking off the entire Sawyer clan to which Leatherface is kin, and then burning the farmhouse to the ground, and a member of the mob inexplicably taking the lone babe of family home to raise as his own, we skip, by all accounts of vernacular, media, and what little of civilization we see before plunging back into the wilds of rural Texas, to be modern day; a tombstone later in the film confirms that the year is in fact 2012. From this, we must conclude one of two things: Heather Miller (the now grown-up Sawyer child from the intro, played by a disturbingly thin Alexandra Daddario) is either the youngest looking 40-year-old heroin chic store butcher (as heavy-handed a nod to the nature vs. nurture debate as I've seen in film since being lampooned in Trading Places) in the history of cinema, or people were picking up retarded hitchhikers in VW bugs while wearing bare-backed polyester fashions of the seventies sometime between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Rodney King riots. So far is this discrepancy from being explained that all reference to the date of the original film's events are limited to ""August 19th"" with the year consistently being deliberately obscured.The rest of the cast is equally unremarkable in presence and abysmal in performance, from the Tonia Raymonde shedding her more tame bad-girl image from ABC's absurd Switched at Birth series to become the requisite slutty slasher-bait, inexplicably involved in a love triangle, never exposed or explained beyond its smarmy, innuendo-laced exposition, with Heather's boyfriend, played by Trey Songz, included no doubt in an attempt to add urban flair and coax minority viewers that are probably sick of seeing Caucasian kids lumber around stupidly and getting fileted in the dark woods.The greatest disservice to the original material was the ridiculous attempt, by way of the Sawyer family slaughter at the beginning and the near single-minded thuggery of the lead vigilante, now serving as the town's mayor, to make Leatherface and company sympathetic characters, even swinging for the anti-hero fences when the bloodthirsty mayor meets his boring and contrived ending. Were the mayor and his retinue of good old boys terrible people for mowing down a slew of people and burning the house to ash with Molotov cocktails? Undoubtedly. But we should not forget those people were part of an inbred family of murdering, cannibal sadists, something that no amount of rural oppression can allow any sane person to ignore.The film exists for the same reason that the sequel to the Blair Witch Project was released: to produce a sexualized, tangential story with hot young actors in a shameless attempt to cash in on a franchise name. At least Book of Shadows attempted a story even if it was a terrible one. Avoid this one, unless you have enough morbid fascination to see both the death of a franchise's self-respect, and one torn button-down shirt which maintained its wearer's modesty purely by proving that one of the few forces in nature greater than gravity is a non-nudity clause.",negative

Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,"Resident Evil: The Final Chapter reprises Milla Jovovich as Alice in the fifth sequel of the franchise that Paul Anderson derived back in 2002. Ali Larter rejoins Milla along with Iain Glen to bring a ridicules plot to an end, hopefully. I couldn't stand the single camera action sequences, I felt like the camera was doing all the fighting and not the characters. Unlike the original where slow motion camera angles made the franchise famous, this one was made on the cheap. The franchise did become the single most successful horror movie series in history but this flick was less horror and more how did this whole storyline get started. You may skip this one but if you want t know the ending maybe check it out.",positive
The Curse of La Llorona,"I haven't seen a horror movie this bad in a long time. Every single jumpscare is predictable. The ending is predictable, just like EVERY other horror movie. No plot twists.
The whole movie is rushed because they wanted to focus on the final battle against evil.
Don't waste your time watching this trash.",negative
The Curse of La Llorona,"I really enjoyed this movie. I think the way to go is Dolby Digital because the immersive sound really adds to the scares and sounds of La Llarona and keeps your attention. What I love most about this movie, is that La Llarona is very visible throughout the movie. You actually see the spirit for good amounts of time and not just intended for a cheap jump scares. I also love that the mother quickly sees the spirit and right away believes in this and doesn't think her kids are just crazy and seeing things. The cinematography was beautiful as well. Now, they're are things I didn't like. Things that were just illogical and predictable. I know that little girl was way smarter than to open the door to reach for her doll while a spirit she knows wants to get her. I also didn't like how at first, when the mother saw the burns on the girls wrist, it was quickly dismissed and to really be believed as just a bad fall. Last but not least, why didn't the kids just say what they saw at first. How could anyone keep that a secret. Overall, good horror movie that exceeded my expectations, especially considering the horrible Nun movie. I'm gonna say this is 3rd best behind conjuring 1 and 2.",positive
Haunt,Horror low budget films are often so bad. This one is the exception. Don't expect to be the greatest movie of the year and you will have such a great time. I would describe it as a very entertaining and tense horror movie. Funny and easy to watch. Great performances and great direction (especially to build the tension).,negative
Haunt,I don't really understand why theres dislike for this movie. Was it a perfect movie? Absolutley not. Was it average? For a horror flick it was above average. Yes parts are a little far fetched and down right ridiculous. However at the end of the day it was simply an enjoyable horror flick. Nothing more. Nothing less. It's not supposed to be Shakespeare folks. Enjoy the ride and stop being so cynical and over analytical. You'll enjoy more movies that way!,positive
Creep,"I really don't understand why people think that this is a good movie !!!!!
Hell not even a bad one, in other word it's one of the worst movies you've seen your life
It's simply 67 minutes of nothing
Nothing is scary at all
Jump scares are too cheap ( I would be ashamed of myself if I would use such a jump scare even if my budget is pretty low)
The story and dialogues are really boring
After I have just seen it on Netflix I really don't know what to say !!!
Always Netflix chooses bad movies or what !!!!!
I would never recommend or rewatch this nonsense
If you haven't seen it yet don't even consider watching it",negative
Creep,"I see now that critics appreciated this film just as much as I did, but I had NO IDEA what I was getting into by selecting a random horror movie I had never heard of on Netflix. Creep takes every little broken piece of horror, polishes it up, and pastes it together into a beautiful and unique masterpiece. It is extremely disturbing and unsettling without once resorting to gore, which was a breath of fresh air. Be warned that the jump scares are severe but cheesy, but for good reason. Horror fans absolutely must see Creep.",positive
Only Lovers Left Alive,"I specifically registered with IMDb to write this review, as I don't want anyone else to have to sit through this film. I have absolutely no idea why it's being reviewed so favourably. It is truly, truly awful and I spent the majority it watching through my hands, because I just couldn't stand the overbearing mediocrity of the whole thing. There is absolutely nothing original about it, and as others have said, the dialogue is teeth-clenchingly risible.I was nervous from the very first conversation, when the Hiddleston's character loftily name- drops a historical figure he knew (because he's like, you know, really old? Get it?). His pal says 'what happened to him?' Hiddleston replies 'Ahh, he was casually shot by a parliamentarian', to which the response is 'Whoah man, that sucks.'. Alarm bells were a-ringing.If you were to ask the least-gifted film-maker on earth what he would do to try and liven up the dialogue of a two world-weary, wise old vampires, he would probably confidently reply 'They could talk about all the awesome people they've known throughout history! It would be amazing!'. And so we have it that time and again, a passage of dialogue exists only to demonstrate that one of them knew a celebrity from the last 400 years. For example, the Adam and Eve (sigh) are playing chess when Eve pipes up 'Did you play chess with Byron?' Adam says 'Ah, why do you always do this?', Eve says 'Oh come on, you know I love to hear about these kind of things' Adam replies 'He was a pompous ass.'. Eve guffaws. It's not over yet though. There's more blood to be beaten out of this stone. She continues with 'And what about Mary? Mary Wollstonecraft?' Adam replies with 'She was delicious.' REALLY? Are we actually doing this? Is this what I paid to see? It was like a scene from mid-90s TV movie Bernard and The Genie starring Lenny Henry and Alan Cumming, only that had the good sense not to take itself seriously. Then there is the relentless, exposition about every little thing, as if Jarmusch was so insanely chuffed with each derivative idea he came across that he wanted to make doubly sure you got it. So something's chucked out there (invariably a gag about having been alive for centuries), you roll your eyes, then it's explained why it was said. As a final hurrah from the Bernard and the Genie gag (and this is the spoiler), as their friend Christopher Marlowe (John Hurt) lies on his death bed, they look at his writing desk. Above it is a picture of Shakespeare. There is then (yet another) exposition conversation which reveals that Marlowe wrote all of Shakespeare's works. Of course he did. He says something along the lines of 'Talentless old hack. But we needed him to take all the credit because I was supposed to be dead.'. If that was the case, why would you have a picture of him above your desk? Is it just so that it could spark off that pointless little conversation for the benefit of the audience? At one point Eve is on the phone to the airline, booking her ticket to Detroit. It was like a conversation from 60s batman 'What's that commissioner, there's a bomb under the central bank? And we've only got 7 minutes before it goes off?' Eve's conversation went as follows: 'So I'm flying tomorrow night to Paris? Then I'm flying from Paris to Detroit?' The point of this purely being so that a) you get the point (which is repeated later in the film for the return flight) that they can only fly at night (because they're vampires, yeah?) and b) when you see her on a french airline in the next scene, you don't think 'why's she on a French airline?'. Another example: She finds a wooden bullet that Adam has had made. We know he had it made because there was a whole scene dedicated to him putting in the request for it. She looks closely at the bullet. In reality the emotional impact to her would come from the fact that he has a gun in his flat with a wooden bullet in it. But she is then made to say (bearing in mind she's on her own, and people don't come out with explanatory statements when they're on their own in real life) 'This has been recently made!'. We know it has! And we assume that you know it has because in the previous scene it was demonstrated that you can date things just by touching them! But just to eliminate any doubt, she talks you through it. The whole film feels like it was edited by Jarmusch's mum, who watched it and, after wiping away a proud tear, said 'I'm not going to change a thing my darling, it's wonderful just as it is.'. Although this does suggest that good editing would have saved this. it wouldn't. It's unwatchable down to its bones.",negative
Only Lovers Left Alive,"Yes, Only Lovers Left Alive is another vampire movie. Yes, the characters are very pale and old and romantic. Yes, it is very much full of clichés and stereotypes. However, it is also wickedly smart, beautifully shot, filled to the brim with talent and full of cultural witticisms.Tom Hiddleston is Adam, Tilda Swinton is Eve and Jim Jarmusch is a genius. This is a director that tells us all we need to know without doubting our intelligence. He allows us to fall into the depths of the film without worrying about a perfectly neat beginning, middle and end. He even stops his characters from following tedious and predictable patterns, because after all, they're too old for that.This is a movie for film lovers and pop culture enthusiasts. It is a vampire film that takes advantage of its time span; cultural references dating back hundreds of years can be found at every corner. Only Lovers Left Alive does not focus on blood and gore, it is not a thriller nor a horror, it doesn't even truly focus on the world of vampires. Instead, Jarmusch studies the eternal, he explores the quiet, perhaps boring, every day life of a modern, intelligent and ancient being who has, quite literally, seen it all.

Carrie,"There was so much cut from this movie that it just seems poorly edited and mismatched. Chloe is no Carrie, for one she is too beautiful to be Carrie. I couldn't believe that they would have cast someone that beautiful for the role of Carrie. Carrie was always odd looking or had an odd look about her, Chloe was miscast. The characters were boring and flat. I felt that Chris, was supposed to always be a vindictive mean cold hearted girl, but in this movie, she seemed nicer and not much cold hearted at all. I couldn't believe how they could say this was better than the original, when it wasn't even as scary or creepy as the original. This faded so far from the book and original story line that it all just made no sense. They even cut the shower scene, a scene that I always thought was a key point on why Carrie was so mad at everyone to begin with. The actors didn't even pronounce the gym teachers name right. Seriously? The co-stars couldn't act their way out of a wet paper bag. This has got to be one of the worse remakes I have seen in a long time. If I was Chloe, I would be embarrassed!",negative
Carrie,"It is just a plain remake of the original movie with nothing of substance added. The main difference is it doesn't have that wonderful, creepy performance by Sissy Spaceck as Carrie, which is a big negative.The only thing this movie adds is a little extra dimension to Carrie's mom - she seems to display signs of schizophrenia or borderline personality disorder rather than just being an evil bible basher, but that alone doesn't make this movie worth watching. I'd give it a better rating if it was the first time this movie was made, but the original is pretty much identical but better cast so I ended up watching only the first 45 minutes before getting bored and writing this review instead of watching the rest of it...",positive

Countdown,"Okay so I love horror movies, I am a big fan of The conjuring,Anabelle,Halloween movies ect. I thought this movie was gonna be stupid, just like how bye bye man, and wish upon were. Then to top it off I read the reviews, it was first a 5.3/10 when I first saw the rating. But i usually still give movies a shot. I was suprised, I would fairly rate it as good as Happy Death Day, if not better. It was funny like how Happy Death Day adds some chuckles, and like there was so many good jump scares!!! Definitely a must try before being judged movie.",positive
Oculus,"This film should have started with Rod Serlings immortal words; ""imagine if you will..."" because this film is a little like a patchwork of 'Twighlight Zone' episodes.This film relies too heavily on 'cut backs' to scenes from the past and then flips to the present in a desperate attempt to sew the two together, it honestly doesn't work (imho) and the characters are to under written with the focus being on the haunted mirror.Sadly this was all rather predictable and pedestrian and you just know what's going to happen (if you're as old as me AND seen as many horror flicks) it offered nothing new and I just can't bring myself to like any of it.Sorry.",negative
Oculus,"When I first read a slew of positive reviews in 2013 about Oculus, I really wanted to check it out. I really enjoy the horror film genre however it's a real cynical bunch of viewers (""not scary enough"", ""not enough gore"", ""this has been done before""), and with the reviews coming down like ""never seen anything like this"", I was interested and skeptical.Oculus is a slow-burn. It's slow and keeps to this pace throughout the film. This isn't the Conjuring which is pretty much fast paced... this reminded me of a mix Last Exorcism of Emily Rose and perhaps the Orphanage. You will either get really interested in how creepy the film gets or not. You will either really dig the layers of how things work in the horror realm or try to poke holes through everything (ex: 30 ft safe radius).The genius of Oculus isn't the concept (haunted mirror) but the screenplay of disjointed story telling and flashbacks mixing into a coherent and perhaps a complex story. Think of it like a toned down Inception. It's effective because you eventually feel and question what is reality and not.This is above mediocre but perhaps not for the mainstream. It's a great refreshing horror film.",positive
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,"Mostly I was interested in this movie knowing Tommy Wirkola directed it because I loved very much his Dead Snow, and it shows. It's stylish, dark, suspenseful, moderately gory, fast-paced and mesmerizing! I really can't recall enjoying another fairy tale this much. Finally a breath of fresh air. Great direction, great writing, great acting, great everything! The 3D rocked this time. I'll definitely go and see it again and will be looking forward to the Blu Ray.And Gemma Arterton is simply a goddess.",negative
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,"I didn't expect much from this so-called fairy tale story which was first published in 1812. If only the brothers Grimm were alive today to watch this updated story line starring the athletic and attractive Gemma Arterton as Greta, and her tough as nails diabetic brother Hansel played by versatile actor Jeremy Renner, I think they (the brothers Grimm) would be so impressed as to how the writer/director Tommy Wirkola brought their story to life (and death to the many witches).The supporting cast of stars such as Famke Janssen (witch Muriel), Pihla Viitala (good witch Mina), Peter Stormare (Sheriff Berringer), giant and lovable troll Edward (Derek Mears), and novice witch hunter in training Ben (Thomas Mann) were all extremely well played.I loved the darkish firey cinematography, the suspenseful battles between the witch hunters and the witches, and the twists and turns in the storylines and the characters. This was a more than impressive introduction which I hope we will soon be followed up by a sequel also starring Jeremy Renner, Gemma Arterton, Derak Mears, and their witch hunter in training Thomas Mann.A pleasantly under appreciated adventure/fantasy/action film worthy of a perfect 10 out of 10 rating!!!!!",positive
Death Note,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!Netflix's Death Note - SPOILER Review.I believe a movie THIS bad deserves to be completely spoiled, if anything to be avoided like the plague.Director Adam Wingard has achieved the impossible, he has taken the title of ""Worst live-action manga adaptation"" away from Dragonball: Evolution. DBE doesn't even come close to the complete disregard of source material this horrendous movie is guilty of.Nat Wolff's Light Turner is nothing like Yagami Light from the manga. Light Turner is a bullied kid who starts his killing spree with a bully. Besides that he is a scarily child who is in way over his head with the book he's been bestowed upon so he reveals his secret to his High School crush, a cheerleader named Mia Sutton (Margaret Qualley), which we are supposed to believe that on the mere sight of the book becomes a raging psychopath that wants to kill everyone, and I mean everyone she feels like, and this was supposed to be the new version of Misa, right?All the intelligence, all the cold and calculating aspects that made Yagami charismatic are completely gone, instead of Death Note we get ""The Killer Diary of a Wimpy Kid.""But nothing compares to what's done to L. The famous detective who is also cold, incredibly intelligent, and astute, is horribly played by Keith Stanfield as a maniac, and frenzy detective vigilante of sorts. Too many times in the film he loses it and even comes close to murdering Light in cold blood, either by running him over with a car or by shooting him. That is something L would never do.The book has about 70 rules, and they are revealed when it is convenient to the plot. And not even Willem Dafoe's Ryuk can save this abomination, his character appears like 10 minutes of the film, and Ryuk is not a bored Shinigami anymore, in this version he is a sadistic god of death who enjoys seen people die.Adam Wingard is a complete hack, someone who either did not understand the manga, or thought of himself better and more capable to tell this story than the original writers. His movie is not even worthy to be called Death Note, it is barely worthy to be called a movie as it is an outright blasphemy to the manga and the anime. It is by far the worst live-action adaptation I have ever seen.I rate it 1 out of 10, simply because I cannot rate it lower on IMDb. I had to watch it hoping I was wrong, but I encourage you to stay away from this filth.",negative
Death Note,"I had no idea this was based on anything. Sure, I know Akira, Ghost In The Shell, Hellsing, Battle Royale and maybe a few others, but that's about the extent of my manga/anime knowledge. And as popular as manga/anime has become in the West, it is still a niche genre. Them's the facts.If those superfans are able to step back out of their extreme partisanship, they would find a slick, competently produced, directed, shot and acted piece of cinema. Production values are quite high overall and the acting, while far from Shawshank, is also not abysmal by any means.Trust me, I have seen a lot of abysmal acting in films.Willem DaFoe's voiceover was terrific and I personally found the character of ""L"" pretty interesting.All the 1 ratings are completely out of place for this film if one solely judges it as a standalone piece of cinema. And of course with a healthy does of suspension of disbelief, which given the actual source material is a complete must anyway. It can be argued that the MCU (and the DCU for that matter) has done much the same thing with their adaptations so what's the huge problem here?Rather, a 5-7 star rating for this film as a standalone film would be far more appropriate. Honestly.",positive
Annabelle Comes Home,"SPOILER ALERT ... this film is c**p !! There you go. An insult to the genre and the franchise, but more importantly, to my intelligence. There was a werewolf, yes a werewolf! Even if you could justify its appearance you couldn't explain it. Avoid. Hang on to the memories of the first two movies and the conjuring series. You have been warned.",negative
Annabelle Comes Home,"Let me just sum the whole movie up for you all:
Parents leave, just the kid and the babysitters in the house, house is haunted, ghosts everywhere, jump scares, then some jump scares, some more jump scares, then some more jump scares, oh and some more jump scares.
I mean honestly do they really think that this is actually scary, do they think they're viewers are 5 years old. Might as well have gone into a haunted house, at least I would actually enjoy it. I really hope this isn't how the next horror films are going to play out. What they need to do is actually hire some real writers, spend more than 5 minutes on the plot, the scary stuff, etc. spend some actual money on the movie as well so we can have some actual good special effects. Why waste our time with this excuse of a ""horror film"". When I watch a horror movie I want to actually be terrified. There needs to be more than just jump scares, like a really creepy plot and characters, kind of like the first two insidious movies, I actually had nightmares from those movies.
Watch this movie if you just need to fill an hour and a half while waiting for your parents or your wife and kids at the mall, don't expect anything new or original or certainly scary.",positive
The Visit,"Walking into the over crowded theater to see yet another over hyped M. Night Shyamalan movie, I already missed the money I had spent on the 90 minute torture. Let's face it, Shymalan has not made a fantastic movie in over a decade and this movie does not show any signs of him getting any better. We all know as soon as we turn on a Shymalan movie that there is going to be a plot twist that is so obscure that we would never have thought of it, but the Visit fails to deliver this mind blowing twist. The idea that the 'grandparents' were mental patients who had escaped seemed pretty self explanatory from the start. Not only is the twist a complete failure but the movie delivers no real scare. There are a few cheap jump scares throughout, but no suspense or build up.The children in the movie are seldom frightened by the bizarre behavior of their 'grandparents', but they do make a lot of jokes about them and are very sarcastic about everything that happens. This strongly takes away from the horror factor. Think about it. You're stuck in a place with 2 elderly people you have never met who are very strange and at one point you even record one of them knocking on your door with a knife. Witty banter is the last thing on your mind. Finally the very last issue with this movie comes from one of the last scenes in which the 'grandfather' shoves dirty diaper in the young boys face and in retaliation, the boy kills the old man all the while yelling like the hype man at an 8 mile rap battle. No not like he's yelling because he's a minor killing someone who just shoved crap in his face, but literally like Eminem's on stage hype guy. As if that wasn't enough to defeat the end of this movie, after a touching scene with their mother, the movie cuts to the young boy in his sisters room rapping about his visit. If a kid had crap shoved in his mouth he wouldn't be writing a rap about it. If a kid had to kill someone to go home he wouldn't be rapping about it. He would be talking to a therapist and not acting as if nothing had ever happened.In conclusion, this movie was unrealistic, the emotions of the kids were very unnatural, the plot twist was barely a twist, and I would never see this movie again if I was paid to.",negative
The Visit,"This was one of the rarest horror movies that managed to keep me totally scared and mostly uncomfortable from start to finish in years and years. I don't get this new trend of hating everything Shiamalan does. This new movie is one of the best horror concepts I've come across in a very long time and uses simplicity to the best effect. I don't get what people these days expect an horror movie to be. If you don't think this a good example of a simple concept that works like a dream...or a nightmare, I don't get what passes for horror in Hollywood no more. The idea for this movie is fantastic, and it's very well executed. I really don't get why people complain that nothing happens in this story. It's that type of simplicity that keeps the scary atmosphere throughout the entire movie. This is not a cgi crap action so called horror thing for teens, this is a classic old school horror, it's filled with a creepy atmosphere and uses perfectly all the ideas for each character to keep the viewer feeling uncomfortable all the time. There's a couple of good scares ,but most of the horror really happens inside our minds. This is the best thing in this movie, it creates such an atmosphere of tension with simple things that when something really dramatic happens on screen we get ten times more startled and there's no need for any cgi on this movie at all to scare teenagers and bore the rest of us to death with the usual clichés. Not on this one.This is clearly an horror movie for adults, its not edited at two hundred frames per second and it has a classic structure that simply is not targeted at young audiences. This is an horror movie for horror fans, it's not a popcorn movie for general audiences so ignore the bad ratings on IMDb, because if you remember the good classic stuff from the 70s like The Omen, The Changeling, or all those movies built on atmosphere instead of action, this movie is for you.Absolutely brilliant. In my view the only thing that does not work is the final sequence after the twist is revealed, simply because the movie stops being a a story that creeps us out and becomes the usual fight for your life action bit we've seen hundreds of times. But until that happens this story is scary. Not because of what it shows but because of what keeps making us expect it's going to happen next.Shyamalan is really back and this screenplay is the best thing he's ever written since the sixth sense and unbreakable. Also the casting is simply perfect with brilliant performances from everyone.True horror is back folks. Ignore the bad hype from the multiplex popcorn crowd. This is a real gem that deserves to be among the very best horror titles of recent years and it will creep you out if you like your suspense atmospheric.",positive
The Room,"What would you do if you found a house with a room that can create anything in the world you desire? If you are a logical meticulous person, things would go as follow... Step 1. Discover the parameters of how it works: What it can create, if it can be brought outside, if it gets destroyed outside the room, how long does it last and what happens if you create things that have an online presence? Can you create a pendrive with next year's best seller? Can you create a new room in the house? These are just a few essential things you would have to know. Step 2. Live your best life, work to survive... because unless you can create diamonds that last outside the house and sell them, it is not an income source and you need to eat. Step 3. Decorate your house, create a ps4, dunno, things that enable you to do things and that you don't need to bring outside your home. Because for as long as you keep them inside, they will last forever. Step 4. Have a family, create millions of millions of dollars and hopefully, when you die, those will become real for your heirs or something (if we apply what they said in the movie and the creator's death makes someone created in the house survive outside, maybe objects will survive too).
Now, if you are a stupid person, create something that lives, even worse, create a person and things will go down like the movie. Ruin your life, your marriage and maybe leave you with huge issues for the future. The best way to thwart what could have been an awesome life full of trips to the ocean, to the forest and who knows where at your finger tips is indeed, to make it a living hell all on your own.

The Purge: Anarchy,"Murder is legal during the night of the ""Purge"". Most serial killers are law abiding citizens, just pathetic wannabes. Thanks to the ""Purge"" they can finally live their dream and kill, kill, kill. But there are like-minded souls roaming the streets and a better armed group or a sneaky sniper can stop the nicest killing spree. This is total war, like Verdun, and even the toughest soldiers hated Verdun. So actually only total nut-cases with a death wish would participate in the ""Purge"". Additionally, killing someone you know will make you the prime target of his friends and relatives, it's not ""purging"", it's stirring things up.The first ""Purge""-movie was just a run-of-the-mill home-invasion thriller with a strange background story. The second installment is supposed to flesh out the original concept, except it doesn't, because, well, it really is a very stupid idea. There are a few psychopaths killing the homeless and each other. But the main ""Purge"" participants are: a) Soldiers, sent by the white, Christian fundamentalist government to raise the disappointing ""Purge"" death toll. b) Mercenaries kidnapping random people, so rich, Christian fundamentalist whites can kill them in a save setting. c) Black revolutionaries that fight both groups and save their brothers & sisters. If the main character would have been black, constantly spouting ethnic slurs against whites, it would have been just like the blaxploitation movies from the 1970s. This will doubtlessly happen in part 3, when the revolutionary leader ""The Stranger"" will turn into a ""Shaft""-like savior.Why do people like this hateful and hypocritical trash? Is it a splendid satire on social trends happening in today's USA? Au contraire. If the really rich would want to get rid of the poor, they would start with ending the illegal mass immigration. But instead - of course - they do promote it. No administration likes heavily armed citizens. They want control, not anarchy, no ""Guns are out new gods""-nonsense. Crime is great. If you treat it in a very liberal way, it will flourish until the people will demand all the right things: the abolition of cash, a snoopier and more intrusive police, stricter gun control laws (for non-criminals) ...Is it ""thought-provoking""? Yes, everything that annoying is.Is it a ""gripping suspense thriller""? If you manage to evade the provoked thoughts, you might enjoy the ride. I actually considered part 1 to be a silly, but quite suspenseful ""Assault on Precinct 13""-version. Due to the sheer amount of stupidity in part 2, this time around I wasn't quite up to the challenge, it didn't amuse me at all.250 years ago a prejudice purported that somebody without god would just pillage and murder. As it turned out, there is no such correlation. The ""Purge"" says that without governmental control and persecution people would just pillage and murder. Again: not true. Except for those few poor souls who aren't, we, the people, are much better than that.",negative
The Purge: Anarchy,"How could a sequel to a film that was released exactly one year ago be any good? This was the question I asked myself as I tiredly sat in line pondering whether I should just go home and wait till at the very least, it's theatrical release. Especially considering the first Purge was somewhat of a let down for me. I guess it's because the first one was purely exciting and terrifying because the idea was so perverse. It was the idea that really sold the tickets, but the film itself, seemed to not deliver to the expectations. After watching The Purge: Anarchy, it became very clear why.In the first film, we were sold by all the trailers, which successfully put the idea in our heads, leaving us brainwashed and nightmare-ring about ""what would I do?"" The first film focused on a wealthy neighborhood and a wealthy family with an unlimited supply of resources. A storyline showcasing that all the money in the world couldn't protect them from The Purge But in all honestly, could the average horror viewer relate to that situation or anyone for that matter?This is where the sequel comes in to blow the roof off the first film. Where the first film failed, Purge: Anarchy not only resolves, but also opens up a whole new realm of fear I had not strung together under the circumstances. The sequel puts into perspective the idea of what the purge would look like from multiple story lines that are not only realistic and relatable but are nonstop and completely unpredictable. I was on the edge of my seat the entire film, beginning to end. Very rarely do I get scared once a movie is over, but I was a hot mess on the way home especially coming down from the adrenaline high from being visually anxious for almost 2 hours straight!There were so many things I loved about this film. The characters were all very well written, most of which were wildcards and constantly keeping the audience guessing. I was incredibly impressed that the film knew how to be violent without being gratuitous. There were so many scenes that could have easily been bloody and gross, but they kept it conservative enough that it made you rely on your imagination, which often made the film much more horrifying in my opinion.It's been some time since I got this excited over a film in the theater but I really can't say a single bad thing about this incredible thrill- ride. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND seeing this film ASAP! The sound of that machine gun still haunts me 2 weeks later GO SEE IT NOW!",positive

1922,"Those who know Stephen King, know that horror is only a small part of his writing. The most part is description of characters, relations and development. In this movie adaptation Thomas Jane is a father who convinces his son to help him murder his wife, to save their life and land. Only to discover that this takes a toll on their life, which will slowly crumble down and eat him from the inside.Thomas Jane works in his 3rd Stephen King adaptation and after a number of movies he turns out to be a very compelling and convincing actor. All the so called action, happens in the beginning, after which it is up to Jane to showcase his ability to perform despair, fear, loss of hope and regret. In such a way, that with only a hint of horror, the movie keeps you on the edge. The fact that you know how it ends, doesn't matter. This only gives more power to the sense of an inevitable downfall.A decent story, with good cinematography, great acting and a creepy atmosphere thanks to the brilliant music, makes this a must watch for all fans who can appreciate drama in thrillers.",positive
The Boy,"I will begin by saying this movie set a high standard for horror films for the year 2016, truly a thought provoking film which keeps the viewer hooked on the screen from start to finish.The trailer basically outlines the plot of the movie, in which an American women gets a job at babysitting a boy, with a desirable pay as well, however she is shocked to see that the boy is a doll and the parents of the boy have every reason to believe that the boy is alive and as seen in the trailer a chore list is made for the nanny and is strictly ordered to follow the rules, but like any other sane person would do she ignores the list and that's when the plot really starts to get interesting.Not to spoil the movie but the plot twist towards the end is probably in my opinion the high point of the film in which the viewers' jaws drop.over all an excellent movie, with great character development, great acting, clever cinematography and stays away from the common horror cliché's, truly a film worth watching alone or with a friend.I rate it 7.5",negative
The Boy,"When an American nanny arrives in a British country home, she discovers she's paid to look after a doll.I am so surprised to see the relatively low score and number of negative reviews, I was really impressed by this movie, it was original, intelligent and kept me wondering through to the end. I can see why some would dislike it, those perhaps that were expecting a Chucky style film. In fact this film is a cleverly conceived, well crafted thriller. I appreciate some bits are far fetched, such as the ex boyfriend's arrival, and of course the conclusion, but as for being watchable I couldn't take my eyes off it for a second for fear of missing something.Well acted by all, this is a film I will definitely watch again. 9/10",positive
Child's Play,"This movie is 100% garbage.I was willing to watch it even though the doll looked terrible and the trailer was so-so. I knew not to expect ""Chucky"" but more of an AI gone wrong. I also had seen plenty of negative reviews, so my standards were pretty low.I thought that guaranteed at least somewhat of a good time. When you expect nothing you can't be disappointed, right? Wrong.The movie is everything I hate about bad horror movies:1. Gore replaces originality. You get over the top scenes of gore that are so tonally off with the rest of the movie.2. Dialogue was written by a toddler. It's so generic and amateurish even for a kid's movie it would insult the kid's intelligence. That's how low it is.3. Character act unrealistically. They find dead bodies and just move on like nothing happened. No real reaction. No trauma. No long term effects.4. Another movie that needlessly adds a ""cast of kids"" to ride the wave of Stranger Things. Only these kids are generic, flat, and have zero story or any kind of objective want/need to drive their stories. They are just tools. Boring ones.5. Chucky is a mess. He sounds ridiculous. He's not funny. He's not cute. He's certainly not threatening.6. Humor is bad. Oh, plenty of laughs, but mostly at how absurd and ridiculous it was. The actual jokes rarely landed.7. The storyline is just bad. It's a paint-by-numbers story that is still off. I'm used to barely there plotlines as a horror lover. But when it's barely there, and still patchy, I can't stand it. How do you ruin ""generic"". It's generic for a reason.8. Chucky has no personality. None whatsoever. He just repeats and mimics and then randomly kills to be Andy's friend.9. Andy and Chucky share very few scenes prior to the killing, yet andy act very emotional when chucky needs to be put down. It was just so emotionally unrealistic. He seemed more disturbed by shutting down a doll he had for 2 seconds than finding the ripped off face of a human being.I don't mind bad horror movies. I do mind stupid ones that don't make sense. That are generic, and still inconsistent, and pointless.I can't think of a single positive thing about this movie. Even the acting as very basic, and not at all good.",negative
Child's Play,"This movie is just a mess. The principal from The Breakfast Club is the CEO of the company that makes the 'Buddi' dolls. This is a poor attempt to update an 80's hit, where old-style dolls are outfitted with Wifi, and can control lights and TV's. The problem is that it shows people going to retail toy stores, which, as of 2019, are almost non-existent anymore! It has all the family and friendship cliches that are typical of modern movies. The violence often gets toned down, by changing camera angles so you can't see most of the violence. When you do see it, it is either too dark to make out, or happens too fast to get more than a brief blip of it. The children are like the ones in 'It': very annoying and acting unlike real kids would talk or act. The friendships seem forced at times, for the sake of moving the story along.",positive
The Wailing,"Wow, it was one of the greatest movies I've seen in years. It gave me chills and maintained it all along for the two hours and thirty minutes - I don't even remember how the time passed! I didn't expect to see this low rating (7.X is a bit lower than I expected). However, it is not surprising to see there is also a negative review. If you are a movie-goer who needs to clarify every movie under a single genre and doesn't like to think but just like to see the clear start-clear ending, this is not the movie for you. But if you like to think and love to find/collect evidences to think ahead and derive the director's intentions and if you want to see a new occult movie, this is the movie for you. If you pay attention, things would lead you to the right direction and that is the beauty of the movie!! Another masterpiece from Director Na and I can tell you that this movie is the greatest of all his movies!!",negative
The Wailing,"Director Na, Hong-jin catapulted himself into the Korean directing elite with his much lauded debut movie, The Chaser, back in 2008. His follow-up, The Yellow Sea, received more tepid response, but there was little doubt that here was a movie-maker who had the potential to be spoken of in the same sentence as Bong Joon-ho and Park Chan-wook. His latest, The Wailing, starts with more than a passing resemblance to Bong's masterpiece, Memories of Murder. There's a series of grisly, unexplained murders in a backward-looking (although in The Wailing's case contemporary) countryside, which is then investigated by ordinary cops – more put-upon locals in uniform than law enforcers – increasingly out of their depth. What appears first as simple murders of passion begins to spread across the village, while an increasing number of people fall victim to a violent – and violence-inducing – fever, including the young daughter of one of the policemen on the case, Jong- gu. A portly every-man and a doting father, he is bewildered by the severity of the crimes (especially so in a hitherto tranquil countryside) and heart-broken by his daughter's sudden affliction. Desperate to find a cure, Jong-gu (played by Kwak, Do-won, a Na alumnus from Yellow Sea) and his friends latch onto the fact that the fever seemingly started after an unknown Japanese man appeared in the area. The more they delve into the stranger (Jun Kunimura, best known for getting decapitated by Lucy Liu in Kill Bill), the more Jong-gu realizes that the situation may belong more in the realms of the unnatural. Enlisting the help of a charismatic shaman, Jong-gu goes to the extremes to find a solution. Fittingly for the fishing motif that's so prevalent in the film, however, the more he bites at the problem, the more he seems to be ensnared.It's been a while since a Korean film had this kind of craftsmanship and artistic control to match its ambition. In many ways The Wailing is the true successor to the class of 2003 – when A Tale of Two Sisters and Oldboy as well as the aforementioned Memories of Murder were released – with how confidently the visuals are displayed, the themes are interwoven, and the story unfolds. The forebodingly beautiful cinematography nods at Kubrick, the acting is exemplary (including a worryingly remarkable turn from the child actress Kim, Hwan-hee as Jong-gu's daughter), and most of all the atmosphere of escalating horror that Na captures is impressively unsavoury indeed. The film is a bold departure (or throwback, depending on how you look at it) for Korean cinema in its heavy emphasis on the occult, a theme more associated in the country with the well-worn moralism of its ghost stories and the oft-parodied rituals of harlequin-esque shamans. At well over two and a half hours, The Wailing is a hefty movie, but with its potent mixture of procedural mystery, black comedy and a prevailing sense of dread, it commands attention masterfully for much of the duration.The one drawback for the film is a significant one that takes the shine off what could otherwise have been a landmark movie. During the course of the film Na throws a number of questions and macguffins up in the air. Who or what is causing the fever? Can the shaman be trusted? Is the Japanese stranger a victim of xenophobia? Who is the nameless girl always hovering around the crime scenes? Or is it all just collective hallucination caused by bad mushrooms? The Wailing takes its twists and turns, apparently answering the questions and overturning expectations. But then it keeps going, reopening closed plot strands and even downright contradicting itself on occasions. It soon becomes apparent that Na isn't so much interested in telling a self-contained story than an exercise in audience-baiting. All of the elements in the film which were so compelling and enjoyable are not allowed to coalesce together in the end, and the actions and motives of the major characters – the Japanese man, Jong-gu and his daughter, the shaman, the nameless girl – are ultimately rendered disparate, abstract and illogical. The ending is neither closed nor open-ended, but rather wilfully indeterminate, and it's tempting to think that Na is applying the film's fishing motif to the audience. Whether it's an appropriately auteur thing to do, or a self-defeating display of directorial indulgence, is perhaps best left to the individual viewer to decide.",positive
Brahms: The Boy II,"Why ruin a franchise with something we've seen a million times? The boy was good because there was no supernatural stuff going on. The very alive and crazy Brahm's coming out of the mirror with a creepy mask and a childlike voice was different, scary, and interesting. Doll from first movie ends up being alive and getting boys to do it's dirty work, not even a little bit. I repeat...WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THIS A HUNDRED TIMES! Child's Play, Annabelle, all of their many unnecessary sequels...why make another one? Why ruin what was unique about this film? Oh, the movie was enough of a hit that you want to make more money with a sequel, but you've supposedly painted yourself in a corner with the ending of the last movie? How about using your imagination. I'm a writer. Here's an idea, off the top of my head. Brahms survives knife attack from first movie. Keeps hiding in the wall with his doll that he put back together. Family comes thinking house is abandoned. Instead of latching onto the boy in the family, he becomes obsessed with the mother, which goes along with his serial killer persona from the first movie. He starts with the manipulating with the doll again, the mother finds the woman from the first film to get the backstory, she comes back to the house to take care of the unfinished business with Brahms, and...go from there. Something like that is more in line with the first story, and if you have the imagination, you could do a lot with that premise to make it a good sequel. Just stick to the first one. Pretend these unnecessary sequels don't even exist. Sigh.",negative
Brahms: The Boy II,Above average creepy atmospheric horror.Well acted and filmed.,positive
Evil Dead,"Save your money. This film is a cash grab of the highest order. A truly shallow attempt to remake a film all horror fans hold dear to their heart.When Sam Raimi shocked and delighted the world with Evil Dead, he did so with the purest intentions and divine talent. Original story. Groundbreaking gore effects. Stunning visuals. Mesmeric tension.A masterpiece.He did so without the desire for box office statistics, nor did he pay shills to promote the film. He simply poured his heart and soul and genius into something he truly loved.This pale, insipid, vapid excuse of a ""remake"" is an Evil Dead film in name only. Nothing original. Nothing enthralling. Nothing shocking. Just......nothing.The sooner Hollywood realizes film audiences are SICK of these types of tepid imitations, the better. Classic and much-adored movies should be left to age gracefully and to find audiences on their own terms, for generations to come.The Mona Lisa was not repainted. And if it had of been,, the copy would be spat upon and condemned as a FAKE! Well, this FAKE is even worse.1/10",negative
Evil Dead,"I have to say I'm very surprised at all the negative reviews I've been reading. I'm an avid movie lover, frequenting the theaters at least twice a week if not more. Something about being able to just sit back in a dark room, with a big screen and great sound. It's just good fun. Movies are enjoyable, not all are realistic and I think that's the point. If I wanted something realistic, I would watch a documentary (which I do on many occasions).I think a lot of the reviews are being very unfair to this movie. I have seen the original and I loved it. Especially when I first saw it as a kid, it scared the crap out of me. But we have to remember that we are in a new age with different technologies and expectations. I bet that if the original was released for the first time right now, it would have been shot down even more than this ""remake."" Although I love the original, the effects don't scare me like they used to. And people who complain about the acting and script of the new movie? Come on. It wasn't perfect, but it's nowhere near as bad as others are making it out to be. And Jane Levy was absolutely AMAZING in this film. I would watch this movie over and over again just to see her act.People are judging this movie too harshly. Was this movie enjoyable? Yes. Very much so. Were the effects good? The effects were A+ and the score was magnificent. Would I see it again? Yes. I would go see it again at the movies AND buy it as soon as it's available on Blu Ray.This movie is not meant to be a remake of the first, rather a reawakening of an old and classic evil. Watch this movie with an open mind and you will love it. Watch it and compare it to the original? You will hate it, because they are not the same movies. Both were brilliant, but I would be lying if I didn't say that I enjoyed this version a lot more than the old one. Acting by Levy was perfect, gore was fantastic, scares were good, and the movie had my attention all the way through.",positive
Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies marks a continuation of the on- screen joke started by Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (2012). A joke that requires no punchline, nor wit nor effort, just a setup that coaxes you to laugh via hastily formed, idiotic, willfully infantile mad-lib. See I can do it too: Mansfield Park and Werewolves, Jane Eyre and the Golem, Lady Chatterley's Brood of Spider-Babies it's all part of the clever art of mashing things together like a toddler banging Legos with their off-brand counterparts. I encountered the quixotically titled book some years ago and reacted to the trailer much in the same way I did then; a brief moment of mirth followed by an eye-roll and a quick step to the left.Elizabeth Bennet (James) lives on her father's illustrious estate with her four sisters and her mother (Phillips) whom aristocracy is still a big deal regardless of apocalypse. Her sister Jane (Heathcote) is smitten for the young Mr. Bingley (Booth) who has a considerable estate. Meanwhile Bingley's friend, the drab, rich and prideful Mr. Darcy (Riley) becomes enamored with Elizabeth but Elizabeth refuses to acquiesce given that Darcy questions the motivations of the Bennets to see their daughters climb that stringent British social ladder. There's also zombies; the blood- thirsty kind that amble around in search of human brains. They have taken over all of Britain save London and the wooded area known as the In-Between.The original Jane Austen novel for which this entirely disposable piece of garbage is based on, intertwines its themes with cleverness and remarkable universality. Is it any wonder that two centuries after its release it is still among the most popular British novels of all time? The novel speaks of wealth, marriage and a sense of self within an imposing class structure. This movie expressly ignores such themes to shovel lazy fighting choreography in the audience's faces. There is some talk about lower aristocrats training in kung fu while higher classes training in Japanese swordsmanship but after a brief example of Elizabeth speaking Mandarin, the entire idea pretty much disappears amid the damp cellars and drawing room rumbles.But ""so what,"" I hear the rabble cry. It's a zombie movie not an English examination of the lives of landed gentry. How right you are, it is a zombie movie; a PG-13 zombie movie that neither delves into the psychological horror of a zombie apocalypse nor allows its audience the joy of submitting to lewd sensationalism. Its gore is tame, its gallows humor is rueful, its sense of dread, apparent yet constantly undercut by the supposed romance. The satirical possibilities embedded in the genre since George A. Romero are completely absent which is a shame because in my mind it is the only reason something this absurd would exist in the first place. Think about it; nobility and aristocracy constantly squabbling about the economics of marrying for class and stature, meanwhile literally an entire country of mindless, bestial hordes try desperately to take away their titles (and lives).Yeah, nope there's nothing purposefully, subliminally, or even accidentally clever about this movie. Not even its endearing economy remains unscathed though I credit the gaffer for keeping the sets dimmed to cover up their shoddiness. By the third act, continuity is completely jettisoned though it's obvious director Burr Steers was much more interested in maximizing style over telling a story competently.There are moments of attempted humor that go beyond the title, and the protagonists trying oh so hard to play the scene straight. Unfortunately those precious few moments resemble Mr. Collins's (Smith) character; dim, irritating and earnestly overdone. In one scene Mr. Bingley throws a prototypical round bomb at a gaggle of zombies right before a hand reaches for his ascot. He struggles to break free before the bomb explodes in a sequence that would have made Wile E. Coyote proud. That was literally the only moment I laughed; a moment so puerile I felt my I.Q. lowering to the number of my shoe size. See the reality is in the morose, unconscionably stuffy, painfully contrived world created by PPZ there is no need for pride or prejudice; there is only room for stupidity.",negative
Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,"I really feel like the people that rated this movie poorly either didn't see the movie and just wanted to give it bad press, or had no idea what the movie was about. The acting and effects of the movie were beyond my expectations, and as far as the storyline, it was Pride and Prejudice. I love the book and movie Pride and Prejudice, I also love zombie movies so this movie was the perfect fit for me. That being said, I feel that this movie would appeal to anyone who enjoys the zombie genre. I had a lot of fun during this movie, I was pleased that it didn't take itself seriously, yet I enjoyed the depth of the characters. I equally laughed and jumped at the shocking moments throughout this movie, and enjoyed every moment. I also must include that I almost didn't see this movie, because of the bad reviews. However, I am very glad that I didn't listen, because I feel like since this is a beloved classic book with zombies people may be upset that this movie was made in the first place. I am a huge Jane Austen fan, I find it a refreshing fun take on the storyline.",positive
Pet Sematary,"I was excited for this remake the second I heard it was coming out! I figured with today's movie tech it could be more like the original story, even more so than the first 1989 movie. The story was changed so much to stand out as an artistic original for the directors, that it became a glorified zombie movie (eye roll). I read the book and watched the original movie, so I had high expectations for this to be even better than those! But it was a huge let down.
I hated the switch in characters, the daughter brought a whole new dynamic to the story and that alone changed the entire feeling for the movie in my opinion. Plus she was older so you're not as heart wrenched at the tragedy of her death, and I hated that when she came back she had memories of her life and just spoke in a lower voice to show her ""changed"" behaviour. I wasn't really a fan of her acting, had she played the Ellie from the original storyline, I think I would have liked her.
I also hated Jason Clark's portrayal of Louis Creed, he was kind of rude and standoff-ish and had zero emotion towards anything in this movie. The original Louis is loving, heartfelt, and affectionate. In this movie he just made you feel like he didn't care about anything. In the book and first movie Louis' grieving is so intense for his child after he dies that you're actually scared for why he's going to do. And when the child does come back; he comes back different. NOT zombie like but actually something worse. I was not impressed with the new version of the zombie being able to talk and converse with Louis and definitely thought the dancing and trashing the place was unnecessary and quite dumb.
And I hated Louis' relationship with Judd; he treats him like some kind of old relative you just want to die already. The original friendship is so much more, Judd shares way more info about the burial ground and gives more history to its powers and consequences. This movie left out a lot, and left a lot to be desired.
I also didn't like the role of Victor Pascal, he had a bigger part to play in the book and in this movie was just sort of thrown in to show they used a guy named Victor.
And lastly, the ending was absolutely TERRIBLE! It was literally just quick deaths, and then scene jumps to zombies standing around in dirty clothes. The girl trying to bury everyone to bring them back to life was ridiculous, it made zero sense and had nothing to do with the original story. I found this to be a cheap attempt for the directors to try and make it their own and add a twist, but it totally bombed and became just another zombie film like every other movie out there.
This story is terrifying, and meant to be sad enough to make you go crazy after being witness to the worst tragedy any parent could ever face. Crazy enough to want to dig up your dead child and bury them in an evil burial ground so that they could come back from death. And then being absolutely petrified with fear when the person you wanted back is no longer there and something else stands in its place.
Instead you get no character chemistry, changed plot and storyline, and a generic run-of-the-mill zombie wannabe movie.",negative
Pet Sematary,"A chilling supernatural thriller, Stephen King's Pet Semetary is adapted for the silver screen once again. When the Creed family moves into their new country home they discover a pet cemetery on the property, and unbeknownst to them there's an evil spirit in the woods that has designs on them. Jason Clarke leads the cast and gives a fairly solid performance. And the writers do an interesting job at making this adaption different than the 1989 version and at adding new elements. Also, the cinematography and set designs set a dark and foreboding mood. Yet the scares are rather tame, and the suspense is often undercut. Pet Semetary is creepy and is good for a few scares, but it's not as powerful or frightening as the original (or the book).",positive
A Cure for Wellness,"Something different. Mia Goth plays Ivanka and her father is a scheming liar who charges people a lot and hypnotizes them to pay him while he screws them over.

But after reading multiple bad comments about the film, I got worried.But I must say, nothing to worry about. The movie is kinda weird maybe, but if you watch the trailer you know what you're settling in for, I suppose. The story develops itself kinda slow, but that didn't bother me cause I was intrigued by the story. The movie has good actors, a great setting and atmosphere. It kinda reminded me of Shutter Island, I think because of the whole ""mystery island with a weird cure-institution""-thing.",positive
The Cloverfield Paradox,"Well, maybe I didn't have very high expectations or my inner cynic has taken a holiday, but unlike the bulk of critics and reviewers here I found this to be a perfectly serviceable piece of pulpy sci-fi/horror entertainment. It's no '2001', granted, but it's a very good looking film with nice visual effects - especially considering the budget - with solid performances by a talented cast, and it doesn't bore you for a second. I'm willing to bet most genre geeks like me (by which I mean people who have a soft spot in their heart for any halfway decent looking sci-fi or horror B-movie), would describe this film as fun.And while admittedly about as scientifically credible as a superhero movie, it's not quite as dumb and far-fetched as many of the most scathing reviewers seem to think it is. What quite a few people apparently didn't get is that 'The Cloverfield Paradox' riffs on the very real hysteria that broke out a couple of years ago when the CERN in Geneva (Switzerland) conducted an experiment to find the Higgs Boson (aka the ""God Particle"" - which incidentally was also the film's original title.) The CERN scientists hoped to find the God Particle by simulating conditions in the Large Hadron Collider - the most powerful particle accelerator on Earth - that were supposedly similar to those in the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang.A lot of people worldwide got scared shîtless by that idea, because they thought such a simulation could have unpredictable and possibly catastrophic consequences, and a couple of scientists even tried to stop the experiment by filing a case to the European Human Rights Court. The wildest theories started popping up in the media, like the experiment would cause black holes that would suck up Earth or open doors into other dimensions; heck: even a portal to Hell was considered a possibility, allowing demons to roam the Earth. So of course it was only a matter of time until a genre film would exploit the idea of a particle accelerator accidentally causing a rift into other dimensions and parallel realities across the space-time continuum.And let's be fair here for a moment: in the history of stupid ideas for movies - especially genre pictures - this certainly isn't the dumbest concept ever to base a sci-fi/horror film on. Also, by putting a Cloverfield spin on it - which, btw, actually is kind of fitting given it offered the chance to explain how the creature from the first film ""stranded"" on earth - the filmmakers managed to get the film a kind of attention it otherwise certainly wouldn't have had. It was a smart marketing stunt (as was selling the movie to Netflix) and probably crucial to keeping the film cost effective and being able to put as much money as possible into the visual effects (the budget for the whole film was only 25 million, and practically the only P&A costs this film had was the Super Bowl ad).What I also don't get is why people expect ""hard"" science from the kind of pulpy sci-fi/horror movie 'The Cloverfield Paradox' clearly is; there's obviously nobody who knows what would or wouldn't happen if other dimensions and parallel universes existed, let alone how physics would behave if they somehow ""crashed"" into each other. And of course it's all speculation and characters behaving erratically: that's part of what makes those films FUN. And believe it or not, that's exactly what I had. But don't take my word for it, make up your own mind; chances are, if you're into genre picutures (where solid entries with very decent visual effects are few and far between), you'll experience a similar sensation.P.S.

The Cloverfield Paradox,"I swear this was written by a 10 year-old. A few quick examples roughly in order of occurence:1) ""The world is almost out of oil and everyone is going to die if we don't find this theoretical energy."" I guess solar, geothermal, wind, and hydro-electric solutions don't exist in this universe. Plus it's the future, these technologies would almost certainly be much further developed/implemented by then to boot.2) Within 10 minutes some random dude pretty much says, ""If we conduct this experiment we could have monsters rise from the sea in the past!"" Uh...kinda specific there, buddy. Almost like you've seen Cloverfield.3) After the experiment goes awry and all the station's systems shut down, they can't detect Earth...and half if not most of the crew of scientists automatically assume it's because Earth disappeared. Not because, you know, the systems are down.4) After confirming the Earth was gone they didn't think to use the stars to find their location until way, way later. Maybe I just don't know what scientists are.5) When the Russian is thrown on a table and immediately dies, you hear a flatline. He was never connected to any equipment. This is one of the only enjoyable scenes.6) Many drug trip-esque random events that have nothing to do with anything and don't even jive with the ""different realities smashing together"" theory. Example: a guy for some reason gets his arm sucked into a nonsensically morphing wall, the wall takes it off painlessly and spits it out, then the arm comes alive with a mind of its own ala The Addams Family (or Evil Dead 2), writes down ""Check the dead Russian's stomach!"" and in his stomach they find the exact battery they needed to do something.7) Example 2: a tank full of worms loses only all the worms and they suddenly appear inside the Russian, killing him as mentioned from before. This, and many other stupid things, aren't ""random events"" but would take intelligence (or stupidity) and coordination to pull off. Though the woman appearing in the wall was kinda cool.8) Wall Girl, who suddenly appeared from another universe, has to wear another dude's uniform because hers got chopped up in the wall's wiring. Good thing it's fitted perfectly for her size and shape. Future clothes rocks.9) Wall Girl doesn't know Asian Girl because SHE (Wall Girl) is the alternate universe's Shepherd (experiment name) engineer. But later she (Wall Girl) says that Main Girl was never on the ship in her alternate universe because she (Wall Girl) went on the mission in Main Girl's place. Main Girl and Asian Girl have completely different jobs. This one's a thinker but it's a nice fat plot contradiction, even in a movie with alternate universes.10) Favorite line: ""Shepherd smashed a Higgs Boson, overloaded, somehow ended up here."" I bet they just looked up trending science topics on Twitter and injected them randomly in dialogue, because these are just words.11) So why did the metal glue grab the guy and stick him to the wall? And don't say the unexplained magnetism because that was pulling consistently in one direction and to achieve what happened it had to succumb to the magnetism then (after grabbing him) somehow completely resist the intense magnetic field and suck him to the wall like a monster, even though all the other metal did not experience this effect.12) A room filled with water is instantly completely frozen when exposed to space, but a room filled with air exposed to space doesn't see as much as a speck of frost although water's thermal conductivity is way, WAY less than air's. Go science!13) A group has to manually eject a giant spinny thing so the ship doesn't explode. The commander heroically seals himself in with it to eject it easier. A crew mate yells, ""No! We can do this remotely!"" I love it.14) The miscalculated Shepherd experiment makes a bunch of random chaotic things happen including sending their ship to a different universe. How do we get back? Press the button again, make more more random chaotic things happen and of course it'll perfectly transport us back to the spot we came from but change nothing else.15) Main Girl, before transporting back to her original universe/Earth, sends a message with constructional and operational plans for the Shepherd machine (what they're in space experimenting with) to hopefully save that alternate Earth's fuel supply. Though Wall Girl from that alternate universe/Earth is there to begin with because she's on the same mission, in the same space station, with the same device that malfunctioned. I think they forgot.16) And best for last: They never say what ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" is. Do they mean the chance of multiple universes colliding? Because that's not a paradox, it's an effect. This supports my hypothesis that they just picked fun science words to scatter about.",positive
Assassination Nation,"Assassination Nation will be someone's favourite movie and I fear the day I meet them.It's a film that sets itself up to be another Spring Breakers (itself very divisive but personally a solid flick) and then slowly then suddenly falls into the realm of unlikable celluloid.All in your face and with the subtlety of a sledgehammer to a watermelon, Assassination Nation evokes groans and eye-rolls after the initial effective half hour (less if you don't buy into this online witch hunt being set in Salem from the get-go)For all it's risky filmmaking choices and interesting editing and cinematography, Assassination Nation dulls on you the moment sh- hits the fan. A place where you realise all in that moment that none of these characters are likeable or interesting enough to get you to care.It feels like you've taken Mean Girls or Heathers or some other more interesting high school movie and thought you could make it more edgy.The film screams with the voice of a teenager who has been on the internet once and has seen a cavalcade of issues in the world and just copy/pasted them into a first draft that was then immediately filmed. And with the references to hacking, it feels like it was written five years ago.Assassination Nation reeks of being the first film a young filmmaker would of made, right down to the snide reference to Fight Club and the most basic cinephile and self-aware references aping someone who's favourite director is Tarantino and just Tarantino.Which makes it all the surprising that this film is written and directed by Sean Levinson - son of Barry Levinson - but also...it makes all the sense in the world.The pure putrid world he has created full of wannabe risky filmmaking by way of The Purge if only we followed the uninteresting background actors digging the hell out of The Purge, starring four teen female leads with nothing to say except the bargain basement discussion found reblogged through Tumblr, feels exactly like something written by a middle aged white man. There's just something about the borderline exploitation of Assassination Nation that feels like it intends to be so cool and so edgy instead fills you with eye-rolls and a lack of empathy.Some people are going to really love this movie, and those people definitely have just begun their journey into film. That isn't the stance of film snobbery here, it's more the stance that when you take a step back and when you grow a little, you realise just how standard and uninteresting Assassination Nation is, full of unintentional parody and utter dullness, where everyone is a cartoon but it doesn't make any good commentary because it's literally what's happening in the world but no additional layers.Extremely harsh against women and just entirely scummy, Assassination Nation doesn't have a lot to redeem itself. You'd have more fun reading a teenager's Twitter feed while watching a Refn or Noé movie full of neon and actual interesting and deep filmmaking and theming.I just really didn't like Assassination Nation, people. It's everything I dislike about indie cinema when it goes wrong made by filmmakers inspired by much better filmmakers and not inspired enough by stories they want to tell and rather thinking the stupid message of stupid America is enough.And also it gives Jeff Winger from Community an alternative outcome for his relationship with Annie with none of the psychological journey. I'd much rather be watching that show instead of this.But then again I could say that about any film.",negative
Assassination Nation,Discovering this movie is by the same creators of Euphoria comes at no surprise. Euphoria has done so well but for some reason this film flew under the radar. It's good! It's really really good! Halfway through the movie takes a total left turn.,positive
Vampire Academy,"I have read every book from the VA series many times over and I absolutely love them - love the story, the characters and everything in between. After seeing the trailer for Vampire Academy I already knew it was going to be terrible, but I went and saw it anyway - I'm such a huge fan of the books, I had to go see the movie. I went with my Best Friend and we both have the same opinion of the film. Hands down, the worst book to movie adaptation I have ever seen.. And I have seen a lot. I'll start by saying that even before I saw the film I wasn't happy with the casting choices they made. And I'll tell you why. Rose Hathaway is meant to be this bad ass curvy, voluptuous girl with dark tanned skin (from her Turkish father, remember?) and dead straight, long, almost jet black hair. What they made her was this skinny, pale, curly haired stick with no curves, no tan and no straight hair. Not to mention you could tell they had to purposely make the actors boobs look bigger by putting her in push up bras. I also don't think Zoey Deutch did a good enough job playing Rose. Don't get me wrong, she's a good actor and as her own character she was great - but not as Rose Hathaway. She wasn't nearly as Sassy enough, not the slightest bit seductive/flirtatious enough and her whole character was built on snarky comments (and yes, I realise that Rose is that kind of character - but that is not all she is. She has substance. And Rose Hathaway in the film, did not). And their decision for Dimitri? COME ON! He was no Dimitri Belikov. Danila Kozlovski did an alright job with the script he was given, he had Dimitri's sneaky smirk down to a T! But he is not a 'god' like Dimitri is so often described as in the books. His fight scenes were all so obviously fake and they weren't convincing. I said it before and I'll say it again.. Worst book to movie adaptation ever. Who ever wrote the script for the film clearly loves their soap operas because this is exactly what the film felt like to me. It actually felt like they were mocking the book. They made it all about cheap jokes and cheesy one liners and the book is WAY more than that. They focused solely on the comedic side that the rest of it literally looked like a satire. Not to mention they added so much crap in that wasn't in the book and they left out so much from the book that really needed to be in the film. For instance, the development of feelings between Rose and Dimitri - BARELY touched on in the film. Rose & Dimitri don't just fall in love at first sight.. They have weeks of training sessions, of getting to know each other before they realise they love each other. In the film, however, they have a few suggestive comments, a couple of training sessions and at the end of the film they are confessing their love for one another. I was kind of like 'um.. when did that happen?' Another crucial focus in the book is Lissa's Spirit driving her insane.. Which they kind of touched on but not really and definitely not enough. They also decided to add a random scene where Rose tells Headmistress Kirova and other faculty members about Lissa's Spirit.. As far as I remember, in the book, Rose does everything to prevent them from finding out... They also made a HUGE mistake when they decided to add a Strigoi attack at the very beginning of the film just outside the gate at St Vlad's.. hmm, last I checked the wards surrounding the Academy stretched much farther out then the gate line. But who am I to say, I could be mistaken.. I've only read the book say at least 5 times! (not even an over exaggeration). Another scene they decided to ruin was the lust charm scene, which lasted all of 15 seconds. In the book, Dimitri sees the 'decision' in Rose's eyes and removes her necklace as it's the last item of 'clothing' she's wearing, then and only then do they realise what the necklace was.. In the film, however, Dimitri somehow knows exactly what the necklace is and rips it from her neck violently. Also, Christian doesn't get shredded to pieces by the PSI hounds.. He gets shot. By Victor Dashkov. Yep. That actually happened. Or, didn't happen. One final point I will make, is that I know how difficult it is to make a good movie adaptation from a book.. There is way too much in a book that just can't fit in to a movie. But I feel like there could have been much better decisions made regarding Vampire Academy to make it a much better film. I even thought that as a movie on it's own, it was terrible. There was no real point to it - people watching it who haven't read the books would probably walk away going 'was that a mockery of all things Vampire?' Not to mention the film raced through the storyline as if there was no tomorrow. I have read some other reviews by other fans of the books and I have to say, I'm extremely disappointed in the fact that they thought it was a fantastic movie.. In my opinion, it most certainly was not. I would be shocked to my core if I heard Richelle Mead say she was proud of the movie and happy with the direction the director/writers/producers etc. took. This movie was not Vampire Academy. This movie was rubbish.",negative
Vampire Academy,"Really the book is much much 100% better. The movie was awful, choppy crap casting. I realize you can't put everything from a book in a movie but seriously this movie was choppy at best no smooth flow. Why did you have to muck the movie up this badly? Rose was supposed to be beautiful, curvy, Turkish decent, sassy. This movie made here seem weak and in the books she was not weak. Lissa was supposed to be charismatic and lovable/likable. The actress didn't pull that off. Dimitri was supposed to be a Godlike guardian that liked to read western novels. Missed the mark there. Bad movie makers bad naughty shame on you They suck at school and you suck at movies. ---Le sigh",positive
Crimson Peak,"Imagine a completely humourless instalment of A Series of Unfortunate Events in which a young Count Olaf seduces Violet's dim-witted older cousin and takes her to live in his haunted red paint factory. Throw in some incest and a lot of graphic violence. Or skip seeing the movie and go straight to stabbing yourself in the eye with a fork.The plot is one long cliché - lonely young woman moons over handsome mysterious stranger, moves to isolated house where terrible secrets of the past emerge to the accompaniment of loud noises, scary music and special effects. Much blood is spilled before the heroine and her rescuer emerge slightly the worse for wear but still alive. The setting was depressing rather than eerily atmospheric. The acting was stilted and drab, the Edwardian era costuming shiningly synthetic. The special effects seemed designed primarily to showcase the amount of money and effort put into them.",negative

"As Above, So Below","I went into this film expecting it to be nothing special and it really isn't. It follows a simple premise that reminds me of the new Tomb Raider game in many ways. From the story, to the characters, to the locations and even the voice of the leading lady remind me of Tomb Raider. Which isn't necessarily bad but it feels unoriginal in that regard.I do love the catacombs setting though. The tight confines and feelings of claustrophobia is always great in horror films. I feel that some of that feeling is lost with the found footage style of filming but it still has the basics to make you feel uncomfortable.One thing I was pleasantly surprised with was the acting overall. Like seriously it was so much better than most of the other films in this style of film and it was nice. Obviously not all of the characters were going to be great but Scarlett, George, and Benji where great and they save any of the weaker performances.Overall I think it was a well acted found footage film that feels a lot like a video game in ways that aren't bad. I give it a 5 because, while it may be one of the better found footage films I've seen, it doesn't get rid of the fact that there's still many other films with a better story and even better execution.",negative
"As Above, So Below","I think people are hating on this movie way more than they should. Yes it is a horror film and no i was not terrified crying in the corner of the theater, but to say this movie didn't scare you it just seems like you think you're this super macho man who isn't scared of anything because you beat slender-man at 2 am in your parents basement. The hand-held camera work is still a very cool concept in my opinion and the filmmakers did an amazing job with this, primarily because they're actually in the catacombs of Paris! Let alone i thought the actors did a great job, and it was very believable and it the hand-held camera work made you feel like one of the characters experiencing the whole thing. No it was not the scariest movie of all time, no it doesn't have some deep meaning, but for the 9$ i spent to go see it, i absolutely loved it. Very cool movie in concept and it was done very well. People who hate on this movie really just don't appreciate it",positive
Life,"This has to be the worst sci-fi movie I have ever seen (and trust me I have seen a lot). It is an insult to anyone with just half a brain. But let me give you a little taste of this gem:It starts off with a capsule with a soil probe from Mars on its way to Earth that is out of control due to a crash with little meteorites. The ISS, where the probe should be processed, has to catch it manually, which they do by means of an extendable arm. Okay. I wont go into the physics off this, but if you have ever seen how much energy is set free when a car crashes into something with 100km/h relative velocity, you should know that such a catching maneuver is bound to go south (not even talking about the problem of maintaining a space station in geostationary orbit with nothing but little jet nozzles whilst trying to get it into a configuration such that it has low relative velocity with respect to a capsule that is headed straight for Earth with something like 20000km/h). Mind you, at this point we are 5 minutes into the movie and the science was already thrown out of the window.Fast forward. We are in the CDC approved lab, which is a plexiglass shielded section of the ISS with nothing but a plexiglass door without any further safety precautions. Inside this section is a glove box, where they keep the probe. Turns out the probe contains life which has been idle for about 4 billion years without decaying (obviously entropy doesn't apply to aliens). Well, how about we try to wake it without further investigation? Yeah, let's do that.Fast forward. It has grown to a hand-sized organism, but has fallen into a slumber again. It's still inside the glove box and attacks the biologist who tried to wake it by electrocuting it. It breaks his tool and his hand, which causes him to faint, and leads to its escape from the box by means of using the broken tool to cut open the glove of the glove box. (yeah, it only took earth's organisms like 3 billion years to learn to use tools, this thing does it in less than 12 hours). But fear not, whilst the life form is busy eating a rat, a colleague hops in the lab and pulls the biologist out. Surprise, surprise, the organism latches on him, so that the other guys have to seal him into the lab. He tries to burn the organism with an oxygen torch and with a flame thrower (which they obviously have ready to use on a space station, ofc). Welp, it doesn't help, this carbon-water-based organism is immune to fire (hey, because chemistry doesn't apply to aliens, didn't you know?). Subsequently, the organism kills him and eats him from the inside. The fire has caused the air vents to open, which somehow can only be closed one by one, and gives the organism time to flee.Jup, we are not even 20 minutes into this masterpiece but the stupidity is mind-boggling. I could keep on writing about a lot more of this utterly dumb movie (like the organism being able to survive in space for prolonged times, the space station being out of fuel just at a time where it is convenient for the ""plot"", the organism drinking toxic liquid coolant, the space station going on a descent right after it has been pushed outward on an ascending course (because screw logic), etc.), but let me finish by saying that in the end of the movie this organism has figured out how to read instruments in an escape pod, how to steer said escape pod and how to safely reenter it into earth's atmosphere, all whilst fighting the astronaut in the escape pod. (Which was tried to be masked as plot twist. but you could see that one from a mile away). And although it has killed every astronaut basically on sight, it decided to leave this last one in the escape pod alive with itself latched to him. Wanna know why? Because it has anticipated that, despite it successfully completing the landing of a space ship, it won't be able to open the door of the escape pod and someone on the outside has to do it for it. Which some fisher men actually do, despite the fact that they can clearly see that inside the pod there is a bloody, heavily injured astronaut with a man-sized alien octopus attached to it.I urge you to not go to watch this movie. Waste of time and money. I have suffered through it. No need for you to suffer too.",negative
Life,"I've seen a loooot of bad reviews for this movie, the primary reason for the hate being that the plot was 'unrealistic' or 'implausible'........ uhm.........what the f**k, haters? If you want to watch a sci-fi alien monster movie that's 'realistic', go watch some NASA documentaries, don't come to the cinemas.Another reason for all the bad reviews seems to be that it 'tries to imitate Alien but fails'. Well, f**k, then no one else should ever try to make another space monster movie ever! Lets just keep watching the 1979 'Alien' again and again........seriously.....So, why do i think this movie is so much better than all the negative press it is getting ? Well for a change it's set on the ISS, not a fictional planet or space-ship floating around 100s of light-years away.....(implausible they say). It has people who seem to be astronauts, dealing with a growing life form, rather than space heroes shooting space guns at space monsters (unrealistic, they say). The horror, suspense and intrigue (which critics say stems for unrealistic situations) is in my opinion a near-perfect example of Murphy's law in action. Then, the acting (another prickly point for the critics) is actually very well done given the situations the characters find themselves in. Reynolds, Gylenhaal & Ferguson all deliver solid performances in an era where all the 'acting' talent is reserved for sentimental Oscar-bait movies. As for the plot? strong, fast-paced yet coherent enough for us uninitiated every-day astronauts. And a SOLID twist at the very end.So, all-in-all, ignore the hate and give this movie a try \m/",positive
The Endless,"I feel it is not really appropriate for people to review films where they essentially got bored and their attention wandered off. sometimes some people are just not wired to like some films.
the problem here is while I did in fact lose interest in this film, I continued to force myself to stay on to it.
First off, it takes a full 1 hour and 20 minutes for the film to get into its ""real"" plot with sci-fi/horror elements. Up until then, we are stuck with two protagonists, formerly a part of a UFO Death Cult, who inexplicably get sent a goodbye video from the cult indicating the cult is still alive. So they go back to the cult and just start squatting and paling around with their old cult friends, all while dryly navel gazing and having some of the most broad, non-specific, generalized conversations possible to convey drama without actually giving us any real substance behind it.
At no point throughout the first hour and 20 minutes do I ever figure out who these people are, what they are, why they have come back, or anything at all about this supposed cult. At no point does any of the meandering dialogue ever approach anything resembling the plot at this point. The only thing we get is that one of the two friends feels at home back in his cult, and the other one doesn't. The only thing overly unusual is the appearance of two moons in the sky, which one of them coyly responds is an atmospheric effect of some sort. It takes a full hour and 20 minutes to get that far and literally no further.
After a full hour and 20 minutes of NOTHING, the movie starts throwing baffling sequences that make no sense, random discoveries of tapes and computer harddrives, implications of a time paradox or the like, and constant mentioning of a ""loop"" which, as minutes tick past and the film rolls on, reeks copiously of Telling, and not Showing.
what basically destroys this movie is it pushes its sci-fi/horror/mystery all the way literally to the very last 30 minutes, and spends the first ONE HOUR AND TWENTY MINUTES not only never even coming close to its ""Loop"" storyline, but settling on a character story between two characters who have no personalities and literally no meaningful interactions with anyone in the entire film. Everyone acts like they never really left the cult because they are such wafer-thin non-entities that they may as well have not been in the film at all. they could easily be replaced by any random duo, even Laurel and Hardy, and have absolutely nothing meaningful change in any way.
By the time genuinely interesting head-spinning stuff starts happening, it's too late. The film has already wasted all its time and instead just taunts us with some genuinely intriguing and compelling imagery, like the fractured remnants of a far superior film that ran out of money 30 minutes in and had to be filled in with cheap, hastily written nothingness.",negative

Much like The VVitch it is a beautifully acted and written period piece set in the early 1900's. The pacing is perfect, the tone is driving and rhythmic, never was there a point during this film where I was bored. The characters were fleshed out and easy to empathize with. Overall I thought this was fantastic. I think it's almost a waste that its a netflix film and did not get a theatrical release. Anyone who loves the idea of paganism, cults, religion without pandering to Christians (which is what The Conjuring does, even though I am a fan of those films), or period pieces will love this film. Do your self a favor and give it a chance.",positive
The Call,"I saw this 2 days before it was released because I won a free screening of the film, and I figured it couldn't be that bad. I went in with low expectations and this movie met those expectations. I'll try to avoid doling out spoilers, but just be wary of the next few paragraphs.Simply on a plot based level, its very cliché. Halle Berry is a 911 operator in LA, who just happens to look so much better than everyone in the building, who makes a serious mistake that gets a caller killed. She ends up being emotionally scarred from this. Wait- stop me if you've heard this one.Then, Abigail Breslin gets kidnapped after exchanging some terrible dialogue with another similar aged girl-the dialogue sounds more like something you'd hear from teenage guys on an irregular basis with lines like ""I'm starving like a motherf**ker"" and ""He totally wants to bone you."" So Breslin calls 911 and gets a newbie operator. The newbie freaks out and so Halle Berry steps in, begging the question of why anyone in their right mind would let someone take a similar call to the scarring call that happened only 6 months ago.There are plenty of moments like this in here where the viewer is left to wonder ""Does that even make sense?"". There are cops overreacting, irrational and risky moves by the heads of the 911 operator office, and the movie tops it all off with Halle Berry making the dumbest decision anybody could make, which is something that everyone has seen in these movies before and not many will be surprised by it.Speaking of surprises, the big plot twist of the movie is in the plot description here on IMDb, even though the twist was a fairly predictable move in the beginning. The whole movie ends up playing out like a bad episode of Criminal Minds, trying too hard to be a psychological thriller.The ending is terrible, by the way. My father, who I saw this with and actually somewhat enjoyed it (his exact words were ""It wasn't bad for a free movie"") admitted that the ending was hokey and bad. It suddenly changes both Berry's and Breslin's characters and takes away any protagonistic features they possessed with one action. When the screen cut to black and the credits showed, somebody stood up in the audience and screamed ""That was the worst ending ever!"" and many laughed in agreement. As I left, I overheard people pointing out many of the logical flaws I too had noticed.So go see this if you don't mind having your intelligence insulted. But if you're like me and plan on only spending your money on things that are worth it, do yourself a favor and don't see this.",negative
The Call,"I just watched this movie and thought it was really good. I currently have an injury so am on bed rest and have watched a lot of movies lately and am getting bored with lots of them but i found this one to be thoroughly entertaining. The plot in my opinion was great! It was different from the average thriller and to have it be from the point of view of a 911 operator was very interesting. I think it's a profession that gets over looked a lot so it was nice to show what there lives are like. I thought the acting was great also, Halle and Abigail both did a great job. And considering Abigail hasn't really done anything like this before i thought her performance was excellent. Yes like any movie there were some things that if you think too hardly don't make perfect sense and maybe could have been done differently, but it was entertaining and had me in suspense the entire time. I didn't have very high expectations but was pleasantly surprised. So i think it's definitely worth a go. It's not meant to make you think too hard it's meant to entertain you which is exactly what it does.",positive
Underworld: Blood Wars,"I watch the Underworld movies for pure action, a little bit of story, and seeing a bad chick kicking butt. As far as girl power movies go, the Underworld franchise is one of--if not--my favorite.Underworld: Blood Wars was, of course, more of Selene (Kate Beckinsale) being the bad B in black. She was still on the lam hiding from both Vampires and Lycans. She had to deal with Marius (Edmure Tully err uh Tobias Menzies) this new and improved Lycan leader and Thomas (Tywin Lannister err uh Charles Dance) an old guard Vampire. The movie offered me what I was looking for. I'm not some Vampire or Lycan purist. I don't mind their story being retold in different ways or their core attributes being altered as well. Did they get after it? Were there some ooh and aah moments? Yes and yes. I found myself oohing and aahing a few times (or more correctly saying OH and DAM!). I will say that there was one drawback. The last installment was 2012, five years ago--the one before that was 2009 and the one before that was 2006 and the one before that was 2003. My point being that, whereas Selene does do a narrative recap at the beginning it wasn't nearly enough to totally refresh my memory on who everyone was and why they all hate her. I'd seen all of them but only once and it wasn't like I memorized characters or even the central theme of the four previous episodes. This movie was still able to stand on its own even with the brief synopsis of how she got to the point she was at. It's a solid movie that can be viewed all on its own if one should choose to.",negative
Underworld: Blood Wars,"The Underworld movies are not classics, but if you enjoy hammy acting, vampires, werewolves and Kate Beckinsale in skin tight leather kicking ass then they can be a lot of fun.Blood Wars is an end game of sorts, although it still leaves room for more films if the money men think it worthwhile. It would be a decent ending if they decide to close the chapter on this franchise now.The plot is quite straightforward, there's some decent action and fight scenes and a few new characters and creatures introduced, and it doesn't drag on too long and outstay its welcome. Charles Dance lends some gravitas to the cast, and Lara Pulver has a lot of fun as the power crazed Semira, while Kate Beckinsale is as youthful and badass as ever.If you enjoy the Underworld series then I'm sure you'll find this a decent addition.",positive
Dracula Untold,"There's nothing new about Dracula Untold. Unfortunately, it's just another film that favours spectacle and style over substance. With a film clocked in at a mere 85 minutes (excluding credits), the story is just not compelling enough for the audience to invest emotionally in what happens next. There's simply not enough time and everything felt rushed without proper character development.In the beginning of the film, we're swiftly introduced to our main character, Vlad the Impaler with a series of montage about his background, what he did for the Turkish empire and why he was renowned for his brutality in warfare. Basically, he's a 15-century Transylvanian prince infamous for his practice of impaling his enemies to induce fear and ensure the safety of his people and kingdom. Unfortunately, the Sultan of the Turkish Empire demands 1000 of the young boys in his kingdom to join his army to conquer Europe. Unable to comply, outnumbered and face an imminent threat from the Turkish army, he decides to make a deal with an arch vampire demon, Caligula, at a price, to grant him power to destroy his enemies.The action scenes are stylish, cool and surprisingly not too violent, scary or gory, which fits the intention of establishing Dracula as an anti-hero instead of a frightening monster villain. The best action scene is where we get to see Vlad summons a colony of bats to defeat the 10,000-strong Turkish army during the climactic battle. It is truly a sight to behold but ultimately it fails to impress as everything just happens too fast.There are some fine performances from its actors, especially Luke Evans. He did the best he could in a film with a bad script. Many of the supporting characters are severely underdeveloped and completely forgettable. We don't know much about them aside from watching them appear on screen talking a few lines here and there before getting killed. None of them have enough screen time for their characters to make a memorable, lasting impression on screen, including the main antagonist, Sultan Mehmed II. We've being told that the Sultan and Vlad were close like brothers and yet we never get to see this relationship on screen at all. We don't know much about him at all. Not to mention, even the origins of Caligula, the vampire demon who sired Vlad is quickly briefed through without slowing down.The film never bothered to fully explore its premise...the ultimate price Vlad had to 'pay' (his humanity) for becoming a vampire to save his people, family and kingdom. It doesn't truly show what a 'monster' he had become in order to win the war against the Turks. Furthermore, the film doesn't take time to establish the characters well. Because of that, the film has lost its potential. Overall, Dracula Untold is just not worth the price of admission. A forgettable film.Rating: 5/10",negative
Dracula Untold,"It's always intriguing with an origin story, because it allows viewers to experience the change, in this case the man who will then become the monster we know as Dracula. This film did just enough on that part, while being sufficiently entertaining as an action flick. But it came with many minor flaws, one that culminates in a less overall dramatic experience.On the good part, the action sequences were great, supported by some well worked visual effects. The cast is also brilliant, most notably Luke Evans and Charles Dance. Dominic Cooper portrayed a bad guy for the second time this year, and though he can perform, he never really looked the menacing villain. He never felt like a threat and neither was his men, so there was little suspense throughout the film. There was more suspense towards the very end, but it did not culminate in a fight, promptly ending the movie in it's rather short running time.As an untold story, it's good to see the reasons and the set up as to how this man had to become the monster, yet it was not properly explored. The case was that Vlad was supposed to resist the temptation of human blood, but it was never explored in depth except for one initial moment. It could have been more dramatic if more scenes show of his struggle, and then maybe along with the repercussions that he may be hurting his own family because of this, which will ultimately be way more dramatic. Several other details like this were not properly explored, which made it a rather straightforward story, enough to make the plot move, but not to make it a dramatic experience.VERDICT:Good: Great action sequences, Decent visual effects, Excellent castBad: Many minor flaws in the plot, Little suspenseSCORE: 6.5(blockbusted9.blogspot.com)",positive
